                  Plants have evolved exquisite molecular mechanisms to adapt to diverse abiotic stresses. MicroRNAs play an important role in stress response in plants. However, whether the other small RNAs (sRNAs) possess stress-related roles remains elusive. In this study, thousands of sRNAs responsive to cold, drought and salt stresses were identified in rice seedlings and panicles by using high-throughput sequencing data. These sRNAs were classified into 12 categories, including “Panicle_Cold_Down”, “Panicle_Cold_Up”, “Panicle_Drought_Down”, “Panicle_Drought_Up”, “Panicle_Salt_Down”, “Panicle_Salt_Up”, “Seedling_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Cold_Up”, “Seedling_Drought_Down”, “Seedling_Drought_Up”, “Seedling_Salt_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Up”. The stress-responsive sRNAs enriched in Argonaute 1 were extracted for target prediction and degradome sequencing data-based validation, which enabled network construction. Within certain subnetworks, some target genes were further supported by microarray data. Literature mining indicated that certain targets were potentially involved in stress response. These results demonstrate that the established networks are biologically meaningful. We discovered that in some cases, one sRNA sequence could be assigned to two or more categories. Moreover, within certain target-centered subnetworks, one transcript was regulated by several stress-responsive sRNAs assigned to different categories. It implies that these subnetworks are potentially implicated in stress signal crosstalk. Together, our results could advance the current understanding of the biological role of plant sRNAs in stress signaling.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Plants under abiotic stresses such as heat, cold, drought and salt will suffer from physiological and metabolic damages harmful to growth and development. As compensation, the plants have evolved exquisite regulatory mechanisms to response to specific stress signals, thus improving their tolerance (Mirouze and Paszkowski, 2011; Seki et al., 2007; Shinozaki et al., 2003; Xiong et al., 2002). These stress-related molecular mechanisms have been extensively studied in plants these years (Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010; Zhu, 2002). MicroRNAs (miRNAs), one of the small RNA (sRNA) species of ∼21nt in length, were demonstrated to play an important role in stress signal transduction in plants (Sunkar et al., 2007). For examples, the nitrate-responsive miR393–AFB3 regulatory module is involved in controlling root system architecture of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) (Vidal et al., 2010). miR395 is inducible by sulphur starvation and is important for sulfate assimilation in Arabidopsis (Jones-Rhoades and Bartel, 2004; Kawashima et al., 2011, 2009). miR399 is involved in phosphate signaling in both Arabidopsis and rice (Bari et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2008). With the widespread application of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) in sRNA biology, an unexpectedly huge universe of plant endogenous sRNAs, in addition to the miRNAs, has been uncovered. However, whether these largely unclassified sRNAs have stress-related biological roles remain unclear. To date, only a few cases have been reported. An impressive example was provided by Borsani et al. (2005). The nat-siRNAs (short interfering RNAs derived from natural antisense transcript (NAT) pairs) produced from a cis-NAT pair SRO5-P5CDH are involved in salinity stress response of Arabidopsis (Borsani et al., 2005).

A recent study on rice sRNAs generated tens of sRNA HTS data sets including those prepared from seedlings and panicles under specific abiotic stress treatments (drought, salt and cold) (Jeong et al., 2011). In that study, Jeong and his colleagues mainly focused on the rice miRNAs for their stress responsiveness and target genes. However, we recognized that these sRNA HTS data sets were invaluable resources to evaluate the potential roles of the other unclassified sRNA species in abiotic stress response and tolerance of rice. In this consideration, we set out to do a comprehensive search for the stress-responsive sRNAs in the rice seedlings and the panicles. As a result, thousands of stress-responsive sRNAs were identified, which were classified into 12 categories, “Panicle_Cold_Down” (the sRNAs down-regulated under the cold treatment in panicles), “Panicle_Cold_Up”, “Panicle_Drought_Down”, “Panicle_Drought_Up”, “Panicle_Salt_Down”, “Panicle_Salt_Up”, “Seedling_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Cold_Up”, “Seedling_Drought_Down”, “Seedling_Drought_Up”, “Seedling_Salt_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Up”. For target identification, only the stress-responsive sRNAs enriched in Argonaute 1 (AGO1)-associated silencing complexes were included. Based on the target lists supported by degradome sequencing data, regulatory networks mediated by specific stress-responsive sRNAs were constructed. Deeper investigation on certain subnetworks based on microarray data and literature mining enabled us to gain further supportive evidences for the potential involvement of the target genes in stress signaling. On the other hand, it indicates that the networks are biologically meaningful. We also discovered that for some sRNA sequences, they could be assigned to two or more of the 12 categories mentioned above. Moreover, within certain target-centered subnetworks, one transcript was simultaneously regulated by several stress-responsive sRNAs assigned to different categories. This kind of regulation sometimes exists in the panicles or the seedlings specifically. Based on these observations, we proposed that these subnetworks were potentially implicated in stress signal interactions, some of which might occur with organ- or developmental stage-specific patterns. Taken together, our results could advance the current understanding of the biological functions of the sRNAs, in addition to the miRNAs, in stress response, stress tolerance and signal interactions in plants.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The sRNA HTS data sets were classified into two groups, i.e. the one prepared from rice seedlings and the one from panicles (see Table S1 for detailed information). Specifically, the “seedling” group includes four “control” data sets (GSM309691, SC1I, SC2I and SC3D), three data sets prepared under “drought” treatment (GSM309692, SD1I and SD2D), three data sets prepared under “salt” treatment (GSM309693, SNa1I and SNa2D), and two data sets prepared under “cold” treatment (SCd1I and SCd2D). For the “panicle” group, it contains three “control” data sets (PC1I, PC1C and PC2C), three data sets prepared under “drought” treatment (PD1I, PD1I and PD2C), three data sets prepared under “salt” treatment (PNa1I, PNa1C and PNa2C), and two data sets prepared under “cold” treatment (PCd1I and PCd2D) (Fig. 1
                        ). Similar rules were applied to extract sRNAs responsive to a specific stress treatment in seedlings or panicles. For example, to identify sRNAs up-regulated under the drought treatment in the seedlings: (1) the sRNA should be present in at least one of the “drought” data sets of the seedlings (GSM309692, SD1I or SD2D); (2) its normalized accumulation level should be 3 RPM (reads per million; the normalization step is similar to that for the degradome sequencing data; see Section 3 for detail) or higher, and should be three times or more than the levels of the same sequence in all of the “control” data sets of the seedlings (GSM309691, SC1I, SC2I and SC3D). To identify sRNAs down-regulated under the drought treatment in the seedlings: (1) the sRNA should be present in at least one of the “control” data sets of the seedlings (GSM309691, SC1I, SC2I and SC3D); (2) its normalized level should be 3 RPM or higher, and should be three times or more than the levels of the same sequence in all of the “drought” data sets of the seedlings (Fig. 1).

As a result, in the seedlings, 84,394 sRNAs (including 42 miRNAs) and 40,993 sRNAs (including 11 miRNAs) were identified to be down- and up-regulated under the drought treatment, respectively. Under the salt treatment, 83,513 sRNAs (including 49 miRNAs) and 76,082 sRNAs (including five miRNAs) were down- and up-regulated, respectively. Under the cold treatment, 86,434 sRNAs (including 30 miRNAs) and 4207 sRNAs (including seven miRNAs) were repressed and activated, respectively. In the panicles, 20,948 sRNAs (including 26 miRNAs) and 7611 sRNAs (including 17 miRNAs) were down- and up-regulated under the drought treatment, respectively. Under the salt treatment, 26,889 sRNAs (including 55 miRNAs) and 13,522 sRNAs (including 19 miRNAs) were down- and up-regulated, respectively. Under the cold treatment, 30,682 sRNAs (including 63 miRNAs) and 21,014 sRNAs (including 26 miRNAs) were down- and up-regulated, respectively (Fig. 1 and Data S1).

The sequence variants of the miRNAs termed isomiRs were discovered in recent years (Guo et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Llorens et al., 2013). In animals, some of the isomiRs have been demonstrated to have biological roles (Cloonan et al., 2011). Here, based on the above sRNA lists, the stress-responsive accumulation patterns of the rice miRNAs along with their 3′ isomiRs (1–5nt shorter or longer than the miRNAs, and could be perfectly mapped to the corresponding miRNA precursors) were analyzed together. The result showed that for certain miRNAs, their isomiRs displayed similar accumulation patterns (Table S2). For instances, both osa-miR1318-5p and osa-isomiR1318-5p (+1) (1nt longer than its miRNA at 3′ end) were down-regulated under the cold treatment in panicles. osa-miR1320-3p and osa-isomiR1320-3p (−1) (1nt shorter than its miRNA at 3′ end) were both down-regulated under the drought and the salt treatments in seedlings. However, contrary accumulation patterns were also observed between specific isomiRs and their miRNAs (Table S2). For examples, in seedlings, osa-miR437 was down-regulated under the drought treatment while osa-isomiR437 (+2) (2nt longer at 3′ end) was up-regulated. More interesting patterns were observed for miR159. In seedlings, osa-miR159b and osa-isomiR159b (+1) were down-regulated under cold treatment while osa-isomiR159b (−2) and osa-isomiR159b (−3) were up-regulated. Taken together, the stress-responsive accumulation patterns between the miRNAs and their isomiRs are quite complex.

Some of the plant sRNAs, such as the miRNAs, regulate their targets through cleavages (Chen, 2009; Jones-Rhoades et al., 2006; Voinnet, 2009). To perform cleavages, the sRNAs should incorporate into the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) associated with specific AGO proteins. It was demonstrated that the AGO1 protein possesses RNA slicer activity, and could selectively recruit miRNAs and certain short interfering RNAs in plants (Baumberger and Baulcombe, 2005; Vaucheret, 2008). Based on this notion, we set out to identify the AGO1-enriched sRNAs from the stress-responsive sRNAs. The following rules were adopted: (1) the sRNAs should be present in at least one of the AGO1-associated sRNA HTS data sets (GSM455962, GSM455963 or GSM455964); (2) its normalized abundance should be 3 RPM or higher, and should be three times or more than the level of the same sequence in the control set (GSM455965). As a result, in seedlings, 128 sRNAs (including osa-miR171b/c-3p/d-3p/e-3p/f-3p and osa-miR810b.1), and 122 sRNAs (including osa-miR396a-5p/b-5p and osa-miR166i-3p/j-3p) were identified to be down- and up-regulated under the drought treatment, respectively. Under the salt treatment, 158 sRNAs (including osa-miR319a-3p.2-3p/b, osa-miR394 and osa-miR171b/c-3p/d-3p/e-3p/f-3p), and 247 sRNAs were down- and up-regulated, respectively. Under the cold treatment, 192 sRNAs (including osa-miR319a-3p.2-3p/b), and 58 sRNAs were repressed and activated, respectively. In the panicles, 63 sRNAs (including osa-miR394, osa-miR1433, osa-miR171e-5p and osa-miR171b/c-3p/d-3p/e-3p/f-3p) and 60 sRNAs (including osa-miR396h/i/g, osa-miR396a-5p/b-5p, osa-miR396c-5p and osa-miR396d/e-5p) were down- and up-regulated under the drought treatment, respectively. Under the salt treatment, 107 sRNAs (including 13 miRNAs) and 79 sRNAs (including osa-miR399d) were down- and up-regulated, respectively. Under the cold treatment, 135 sRNAs (including nine miRNAs) and 88 sRNAs (including osa-miR169b/c and osa-miR399j) were down- and up-regulated, respectively (Fig. 1 and Data S2).

The sequence characteristics of the stress-responsive sRNAs and of those enriched in the AGO1 complexes were analyzed. For the stress-responsive miRNAs, 5′ Us (uridines) occupy a large portion (∼40% on average) except for the miRNAs up-regulated under the salt treatment in the seedlings (Fig. 2
                        A). It is quite different for the other stress-responsive sRNAs. The sRNAs starting with 5′ As (adenines) and the ones starting with 5′ Gs (guanines) together occupy ∼60% of the stress-responsive sRNAs excluding miRNAs (Fig. 2B). Besides, the 21-nt miRNAs occupy more than 40% of the stress-responsive miRNAs (Fig. 2C). However, for the other stress-responsive sRNAs, the 24-nt ones occupy a dominant portion, especially for those identified in the panicles (∼60%) (Fig. 2D). After AGO1 enrichment analysis, the sequence characteristics were extensively altered. For most of the stress-responsive miRNAs, they start with 5′ Us, and are 20 or 21nt in length (Fig. S1A and Fig. S1C). For the other stress-responsive sRNAs, ∼55% start with 5′ Us, and ∼96% are 19 to 21 nt in length (Fig. S1B and Fig. S1D). A previous study reported that the sRNAs associated with the AGO1 silencing complexes favored 5′ Us and were predominantly 21nt in length (Mi et al., 2008). From this point of view, our AGO1 enrichment filtering tended to selectively extract 5′ U-started, 19–21nt ones from the stress-responsive sRNAs.

We speculated that the AGO1-enriched, stress-responsive sRNAs possessed great potential of performing target cleavages. In this regard, target prediction was performed for these sRNAs by using miRU algorithm (Dai and Zhao, 2011; Zhang, 2005) with default parameters. As a result, under drought treatment, 2542 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 128 sRNAs down-regulated in seedlings, 3726 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 118 sRNAs up-regulated in seedlings, 1409 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 62 sRNAs down-regulated in panicles, and 1288 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 59 sRNAs up-regulated in panicles. Under salt treatment, 3386 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 157 sRNAs down-regulated in seedlings, 4946 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 245 sRNAs up-regulated in seedlings, 1830 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 105 sRNAs down-regulated in panicles, and 1160 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 79 sRNAs up-regulated in panicles. Under the cold treatment, 4352 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 191 sRNAs down-regulated in seedlings, 1913 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 56 sRNAs up-regulated in seedlings, 2437 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 133 sRNAs down-regulated in panicles, and 1391 transcripts were predicted to be targeted by 86 sRNAs up-regulated in panicles.

Degradome sequencing is a high-throughput method for sRNA—target pair validation (German et al., 2009; German et al., 2008). According to the analytical workflow (Meng et al., 2011), four degradome sequencing data sets (Table S1) were included for target validation. Considering the previous observations that some evident cleavage signals resided out of the canonical slicing sites (10–11thnt of the regulatory sRNAs) (Addo-Quaye et al., 2008; Addo-Quaye et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Llave et al., 2002), the binding sites with prominent cleavage signals resided within 8–12thnt of the regulatory sRNAs were retained. Among the validated sRNA—target pairs, we observed that many binding sites were supported by evident degradome signatures resided within the canonical cleavage sites (10–11thnt of the regulatory sRNAs) (Fig. 3
                         and Fig. S2).

Based on the target lists, the sRNA-mediated regulatory networks were constructed by using Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) (Fig. S3). According to the stress responsiveness of the sRNAs, the networks were classified into 12 groups, i.e. “Panicle_Cold_Down” [a total of 158 sRNA–target interactions exist in this network which involves 105 target transcripts and 29 sRNAs (including 14 miRNAs) down-regulated under cold treatment in panicles], “Panicle_Cold_Up” [203 interactions exist in this network which involves 70 targets and 21 sRNAs (including osa-miR169b and osa-miR169c) up-regulated under cold treatment in panicles], “Panicle_Drought_Down” [47 interactions involving 46 targets and 12 sRNAs (including osa-miR171b, osa-miR171c-3p, osa-miR171d-3p, osa-miR171e-3p, osa-miR171f-3p and osa-miR394) down-regulated under drought treatment in panicles], “Panicle_Drought_Up” [191 interactions involving 60 targets and 23 sRNAs (including osa-miR396a-5p, osa-miR396b-5p, osa-miR396c-5p, osa-miR396d, osa-miR396e-5p, osa-miR396g, osa-miR396h and osa-miR396i) up-regulated under drought treatment in panicles], “Panicle_Salt_Down” [146 interactions involving 75 targets and 32 sRNAs (including 19 miRNAs) down-regulated under salt treatment in panicles], “Panicle_Salt_Up” [65 interactions involving 25 targets and 11 sRNAs up-regulated under salt treatment in panicles], “Seedling_Cold_Down” [110 interactions involving 81 targets and 20 sRNAs (including osa-miR319a-3p.2-3p and osa-miR319b) down-regulated under cold treatment in seedlings], “Seedling_Cold_Up” [39 interactions involving 20 targets and nine sRNAs up-regulated under cold treatment in seedlings], “Seedling_Drought_Down” [92 interactions involving 57 targets and 17 sRNAs (including osa-miR171b, osa-miR171c-3p, osa-miR171d-3p, osa-miR171e-3p and osa-miR171f-3p) down-regulated under drought treatment in seedlings], “Seedling_Drought_Up” [60 interactions involving 59 targets and 11 sRNAs (including osa-miR166i-3p, osa-miR166j-3p, osa-miR396a-5p and osa-miR396b-5p) up-regulated under drought treatment in seedlings], “Seedling_Salt_Down” [160 interactions involving 129 targets and 27 sRNAs (including osa-miR171b, osa-miR171c-3p, osa-miR171d-3p, osa-miR171e-3p, osa-miR171f-3p, osa-miR319a-3p.2-3p, osa-miR319b and osa-miR394) down-regulated under salt treatment in seedlings] and “Seedling_Salt_Up” [102 interactions involving 89 targets and 23 sRNAs up-regulated under salt treatment in seedlings]. The result indicates that in addition to the miRNAs, some of the other unclassified sRNAs could guide the AGO1 complexes to perform target cleavages under specific stress treatments in rice. Besides, these degradome sequencing data-supported networks could serve as a basis for in-depth studies on the sRNA-mediated stress signaling in rice.

Considering the repressive role of the AGO1-enriched sRNAs in gene expression, we deduced that the target genes should display contrary stress-responsive expression patterns compared to the corresponding sRNA regulators. To support this notion, two sets of the rice gene microarray data (OS10 and OS37) were obtained from PLEXdb (Plant Expression Database) (Dash et al., 2012). OS10, a gift from the previous report by Jain et al. (2007), contains the gene expression data of rice seedlings under drought, salt and cold treatments. OS37, provided by a recent study (Wang et al., 2011), contains the gene expression data under drought treatment in panicles. Notably, for both data sets, there are three replicates for each stress treatment. In this expression-based analysis, the mean value of the three replicates was calculated for each target gene.

Several pieces of supportive evidences were obtained for certain sRNA—target pairs (Fig. 4
                         and Data S3). Specifically, within the network mediated by the sRNAs up-regulated under drought treatment in panicles (Fig. 4A), the expression level of LOC_Os02g53690 (regulated by miR396 and Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA5602) in the panicles was 51.54 under drought treatment versus 91.25 under control. LOC_Os12g41860 regulated by Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA5361, Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA5364, Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA7099 and Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA7393 was expressed at 176.02 under drought treatment in panicles, while expressed at 467.96 under control. LOC_Os10g33960, also regulated by the above four sRNAs, was expressed at 288.64 under drought treatment in panicles versus 628.12 under control. Similar supportive evidences were found for the target genes LOC_Os01g48060, LOC_Os01g54990, LOC_Os03g51330, LOC_Os03g51970, LOC_Os07g32170, LOC_Os12g29980 and LOC_Os12g41950, which were expressed much lower under drought treatment than control in panicles (Data S3). For the network mediated by the sRNAs down-regulated under the drought treatment in the panicles (Fig. 4B), LOC_Os05g03574 and LOC_Os05g51140 both regulated by Panicle_Drought_Down_sRNA17639 were expressed at 80.20 and 2258.63 under drought treatment versus 48.57 and 1460.65 under control, respectively. Similar supportive evidences were found for LOC_Os01g69940 and LOC_Os08g19114 (Data S3). In seedlings, within the network mediated by the sRNAs repressed by drought stress (Fig. 4C), LOC_Os05g48590 targeted by Seedling_Drought_Down_sRNA51230 was expressed at 308.67 under drought treatment in seedlings versus 102.80 under control (Data S3). For LOC_Os02g17940 regulated by Seedling_Drought_Up_sRNA38390 (Fig. 4D), it was expressed at 23.70 under drought and at 59.76 under control (Data S3). Within the network mediated by the sRNAs down-regulated under salt treatment in seedlings (Fig. 4E), LOC_Os02g39910 and LOC_Os06g44620, both targeted by Seedling_Salt_Down_sRNA46587, were expressed at 105.13 and 1235.80 under salt treatment while at 55.55 and 805.51 under control, respectively (Data S3). Within the network mediated by the sRNAs up-regulated under salt treatment in seedlings (Fig. 4G), LOC_Os02g17940 targeted by Seedling_Drought_Up_sRNA38390 and Seedling_Salt_Up_sRNA72907 was expressed at 30.94 under salt treatment while at 59.76 under control (Data S3). Within the network mediated by the sRNAs down-regulated under cold treatment in seedlings (Fig. 4F), LOC_Os01g59660, simultaneously targeted by Seedling_Cold_Down_sRNA37423, Seedling_Cold_Down_sRNA56879 and Seedling_Cold_Down_sRNA57515, was expressed at 173.70 under cold treatment versus 71.58 under control (Data S3). LOC_Os04g46860 regulated by Seedling_Cold_Down_sRNA54170, was expressed at 307.84 under cold treatment in seedlings versus 173.53 under control (Data S3). More microarray data-based supportive evidences could be found in Data S3. Summarily, contrary expression patterns under specific stress treatments were observed between certain target genes and the regulatory sRNAs, which was consistent with the repressive role of the AGO1-enriched sRNAs in gene expression.

We intended to find some stress-related evidences for the target genes based on the functional annotations and literature mining. Fortunately, some positive hints were obtained. Within the network mediated by the sRNAs down-regulated under cold treatment in seedlings (Fig. 4F), LOC_Os01g59660 targeted by Seedling_Cold_Down_sRNA37423, Seedling_Cold_Down_sRNA56879 and Seedling_Cold_Down_sRNA57515 encodes an MYB family transcription factor based on the annotation from TIGR rice (the rice genome annotation project established by the institute for genome research) (Yuan et al., 2003). Involvement of the rice MYB genes in cold tolerance has been demonstrated by transgenic experiments in both Arabidopsis and rice (Dai et al., 2007; Park et al., 2010; Vannini et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2012). Both LOC_Os03g29760 and LOC_Os12g42400, regulated by Seedling_Cold_Down_sRNA26378 and Seedling_Cold_Down_sRNA51152, encode the subunits of nuclear transcription factor Y, which are homologous to the subunit A of nuclear factor Y (NF–YA) in Arabidopsis. Based on a recent report, overexpression of NF–YA confers tolerance to diverse abiotic stresses including cold in Arabidopsis (Leyva-Gonzalez et al., 2012). More interestingly, the Aux/IAA family is down-regulated under the cold treatment in Arabidopsis (Hannah et al., 2005), whereas LOC_Os05g48590 encoding OsIAA19 was induced by the cold stress signal in rice based on the microarray data (Data S3) and a recent report (Jain and Khurana, 2009). Whether different members of the Aux/IAA family possess opposite roles in cold stress response needs further characterization. Based on a previous study, many auxin-related genes [including ARF (Auxin Response Factor) and Aux/IAA genes] were responsive to drought and salt stress signals in rice (Jain et al., 2007). This correlates well with the existence of certain ARF genes (LOC_Os01g48060, LOC_Os01g54990, LOC_Os12g41950) and Aux/IAA genes (LOC_Os05g48590) within the networks mediated by the sRNAs responsive to drought and salt stresses (Fig. 4A, C and E). Within the networks mediated by the sRNAs responsive to drought stress (Fig 4A–D), several literature-based evidences were obtained. LOC_Os01g69940 regulated by osa-miR394 and Panicle_Drought_Down_sRNA4816 encodes OsFBX32, an F-box domain containing protein. According to the annotation from TIGR rice, the homologous gene of LOC_Os01g69940 in Arabidopsis is AT1G27340. Based on a recent report, overexpression of gma-miR394a of soybean increased drought tolerance of the transgenic Arabidopsis. Notably, AT1G27340 was the target of gma-miR394a (Ni et al., 2012). Consistently, overexpression of LOC_Os02g44990, another F-box gene, reduced the drought tolerance in transgenic rice (Yan et al., 2011). LOC_Os05g34700, targeted by Seedling_Drought_Up_sRNA38390, encodes a GDSL-like lipase. Interestingly, overexpression of CaGLIP1 (a pepper GDLS-type lipase gene) in Arabidopsis enhanced the drought tolerance of the transgenic plants (Hong et al., 2008). LOC_Os03g51330, encoding a GRAS family transcription factor domain containing protein, is targeted by Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA1813. Based on the recent reports, overexpression of BnLAS (a GRAS family gene of Brassica napus) or PeSCL7 (a poplar GRAS gene) could increase drought tolerance of the transgenic plants of Arabidopsis (Ma et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011). Three genes (LOC_Os02g53690, LOC_Os03g51970 and LOC_Os12g29980, all of which were targeted by osa-miR396 and Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA5602) encoding growth regulating factor (GRF) proteins were included in the drought-related networks (Fig. 4A and D). In Arabidopsis, overexpression of miR396 targeting GRF genes increased drought tolerance of the transgenic plants (Liu et al., 2009). Both LOC_Os03g48970 (regulated by Seedling_Drought_Down_sRNA47087) and LOC_Os07g41720 (regulated by Seedling_Drought_Down_sRNA24360 and Seedling_Drought_Down_sRNA47087) encode the nuclear transcription factor Y subunits. In both Arabidopsis and maize, the nuclear factor Y family genes were demonstrated to be implicated in drought resistance (Leyva-Gonzalez et al., 2012; Li et al., 2008; Nelson et al., 2007). LOC_Os08g32500, targeted by Seedling_Drought_Up_sRNA31040, encodes a nucleobase-ascorbate transporter. In a recent study, the involvement of a rice nucleobase–ascorbate transporter (encoded by LOC_Os09g15170) in drought signal transduction was reported (Moumeni et al., 2011). LOC_Os07g32170 encoding OsSPL13 (a SBP-box family member) was regulated by five sRNAs up-regulated under the drought treatment in the rice panicles (Fig. 4A). Potential role of SPL genes in drought tolerance was proposed in Medicago truncatula (Trindade et al., 2010). LOC_Os10g33960 (regulated by Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA5361, Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA5364, Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA7099 and Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA7393) and LOC_Os12g41860 (regulated by osa-miR166i-3p/j-3p, Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA5361, Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA5364, Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA7099 and Panicle_Drought_Up_sRNA7393) encode START domain containing proteins. In Arabidopsis, overexpression of an HD-START protein could improve drought tolerance (Yu et al., 2008). Within the networks mediated by the sRNAs responsive to salt stress in the seedlings (Fig. 4E and G), LOC_Os01g04860 encoding a DUF647 domain containing protein was previously demonstrated to be highly responsive to salt stress (Pandit et al., 2011). LOC_Os05g34700 encoding a GDSL-like lipase was regulated by Seedling_Salt_Up_sRNA72907. According to a previous study, overexpression of a GDSL-motif lipase of Arabidopsis could increase salt tolerance in yeast and the transgenic plants (Naranjo et al., 2006). LOC_Os06g06560 encoding a starch synthase was regulated by Seedling_Salt_Down_sRNA53510. A previous study by Chen et al. (2008) showed that the starch content was decreased in the rice seedling leaves upon the NaCl-stressed treatment. And this process was mediated by granule-bound starch synthase. LOC_Os09g34250 regulated by Seedling_Salt_Down_sRNA53510 encodes a UDP-glucosyltransferase. In Arabidopsis, the UDP-Glucosyltransferase UGT74E2 could improve water stress tolerance through perturbation of indole-3-butyric acid homeostasis (Tognetti et al., 2010). Summarily, all these evidences indicate that the networks established in this study are biologically meaningful.

In recent years, many stress-responsive sRNAs were successfully identified from rice and other plants. To gain better understanding of the common biological roles of plant sRNAs in stress signaling, a comprehensive comparison was performed between the rice stress-responsive sRNAs discovered in this study and the previously identified stress-responsive plant sRNAs. In rice, it has been reported that miR166 and miR396 were down-regulated under drought stress (Ding et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2010), while miR169 and miR393 were up-regulated under water deficit (Contreras-Cubas et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2007). Consistently, in our study, we discovered that most of the miR166 family members (including osa-miR166a-5p, osa-miR166b-5p, osa-miR166d-5p, osa-miR166e-5p, osa-miR166g-5p and osa-miR166n-5p) and osa-miR396c-3p were greatly repressed by drought treatment in either seedlings or panicles. Moreover, according to the results of this study, osa-miR169a, osa-miR169f.2, osa-miR169n, osa-miR169o and osa-miR393b-3p were identified to be up-regulated by drought stress. However, contradictory cases were also discovered in our analysis. For examples, miR168 was reported to be repressed by drought stress (Ding et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2010). But we found that only one member of rice miR168 family (osa-miR168a-5p) was responsive to drought, and this miRNA was up-regulated by drought stress in panicles. Interestingly, in Arabidopsis, miR168 was demonstrated to be induced by drought stress (Ding et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2008). For cetain miRNA families, it has not been reported that these miRNAs were responsive to abiotic stresses in rice, but they were validated to be stress-responsive in other plant species according to previous studies. For instances, miR171 of Arabidopsis is induced by drought stress (Contreras-Cubas et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2008). In our study, we found that many miR171 family members (osa-miR171b, osa-miR171c-3p, osa-miR171d-3p, osa-miR171e-5p, osa-miR171e-3p, osa-miR171f-5p and osa-miR171f-3p) were also drought-responsive in rice, but they were repressed by water deficit. In common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), miR2118 is up-regulated under water deficit (Contreras-Cubas et al., 2012; Arenas-Huertero et al., 2009). Notably, we discovered that osa-miR2118f, osa-miR2118h, osa-miR2118j, osa-miR2118k and osa-miR2118m were also inducible by drought stress in rice panicles. In Brassica juncea, the accumulation level of miR172 is repressed under salt or drought stress (Bhardwaj et al., 2014). Interestingly, in rice seedlings, we found that miR172a, miR172b and miR172d-3p were also down-regulated under both stresses. In tomato (Solanum habrochaites), miR159 and miR390 were reported to be repressed by chilling stress, while miR399 was up-regulated by cold stress (Cao et al., 2014). Consistently, in rice panicles, we identified that osa-miR159a.1, osa-miR159b and osa-miR390-5p were down-regulated by low-temperature treatment, while osa-miR399j was induced by chilling stress. Furthermore, we noticed that except for the miRNAs, all of the other rice stress-responsive sRNAs identified in our study had not been reported in any previous report. Thus, for the future experimental studies, it is interesting to see whether these stress-responsive sRNAs are conserved among different plant species or they are just rice-specific, and the biological roles of these sRNAs need to be analyzed in-depth.

We noticed that certain target genes supported by three pieces of evidences (i.e. degradome sequencing data, microarray data and literatures) were simultaneously regulated by several sRNAs responsive to different stresses. For example, LOC_Os05g34700 was regulated by Seedling_Drought_Up_sRNA38390 and Seedling_Salt_Up_sRNA72907. LOC_Os05g48590 was targeted by Seedling_Cold_Down_sRNA55719, Seedling_Drought_Down_sRNA51230 and Seedling_Salt_Down_sRNA51251. This interesting observation points to the potential interactions among different stress signals in rice. Based on this consideration, we first searched for the sRNA sequences that could be assigned to two or more of the 12 categories (“Panicle_Cold_Down”, “Panicle_Cold_Up”, “Panicle_Drought_Down”, “Panicle_Drought_Up”, “Panicle_Salt_Down”, “Panicle_Salt_Up”, “Seedling_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Cold_Up”, “Seedling_Drought_Down”, “Seedling_Drought_Up”, “Seedling_Salt_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Up”). All the stress-responsive sRNAs identified above (Data S1) were analyzed. As a result, thousands of sRNA sequences were identified to be responsive to multiple stress signals in the seedlings and/or the panicles (Data S4). More detailed statistical result is shown in Fig. 5
                        , and only the sRNA sequences simultaneously assigned to four or more categories were included. Specifically, 386 sRNA sequences could be simultaneously assigned to six categories, and they were consistently down-regulated under different stress treatments in both seedlings and panicles. Similarly, 164 sRNAs were assigned to “Panicle_Cold_Down”, “Panicle_Salt_Down”, “Seedling_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Drought_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Down”, 112 sRNAs were assigned to “Panicle_Cold_Down”, “Panicle_Drought_Down”, “Seedling_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Drought_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Down”, 197 sRNAs were assigned to “Panicle_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Drought_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Down”, and 101 sRNAs were assigned to “Panicle_Cold_Down”, “Panicle_Salt_Down”, “Seedling_Cold_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Down”. These results indicate that the stress responsiveness of certain sRNAs is not significantly altered between the vegetative seedlings and the reproductive panicles. Interestingly, these sRNAs were all repressed under the stress treatments. However, whether these sRNAs play an essential role in maintaining consistent stress responsiveness during developmental stage transition remain to be clarified. Contrary response patterns of a sRNA sequence between the seedlings and the panicles were also discovered. There are 160 sRNA sequences simultaneously assigned to “Panicle_Cold_Up”, “Panicle_Salt_Up”, “Seedling_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Drought_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Down”, 410 sRNA sequences assigned to “Panicle_Cold_Up”, “Seedling_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Drought_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Down”, and 520 sRNA sequences including osa-miR435 and osa-miR1425-3p assigned to “Panicle_Salt_Up”, “Seedling_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Drought_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Down”. It indicates that distinct response patterns under specific stress treatment exist between the vegetative seedlings and the reproductive panicles, which might be mediated by these novel stress-responsive sRNAs.

Next, a comprehensive search was performed to extract the subnetworks simultaneously mediated by different categories of the stress-responsive sRNAs from the established networks (Fig. S3). As a result, 192 transcription forms belonging to 133 target genes were regulated by the stress-responsive sRNAs assigned to two or more categories (Table S3). As discovered above, in many cases, one sRNA sequence was able to response to multiple stress signals. It includes eight miRNA sequences osa-miR159a.1/b, osa-miR160f-5p, osa-miR171b/c-3p/d-3p/e-3p/f-3p, osa-miR319a-3p.2-3p/b, osa-miR394, osa-miR396a-5p/b-5p, osa-miR396c-5p and osa-miR396d/e-5p (Table S4). To gain deeper insights, certain featured, target gene-centered subnetworks potentially implicated in stress signal interactions were extracted (Fig. 6
                        ). Potential signal crosstalk was observed for the LOC_Os01g11430.1 (encodes an expressed protein)-centered (Fig. 6A), the LOC_Os02g44360.1 (a scarecrow transcription factor family protein)-centered (Fig. 6D), the LOC_Os06g40330.1 (a MYB family transcription factor)-centered (Fig. 6E), and the LOC_Os02g45570.1 (a growth regulating factor protein)-centered (Fig. 6H) subnetworks. Each of these transcripts was targeted by the cold-responsive, the drought-responsive and the salt-responsive sRNAs simultaneously. We also noticed that for certain subnetworks, potential stress signal interactions appeared to be seedling-specific or panicle-specific (Table S3 and Fig. 6). For examples, within the LOC_Os01g69940.1 (OsFBX32, an F-box domain containing protein)-centered (Fig. 6B), the LOC_Os02g41800.1 (an auxin response factor)-centered (Fig. 6F), the LOC_Os04g43910.1 (an auxin response factor)-centered (Fig. 6I), and the LOC_Os10g39970.1 (a harpin-induced protein 1 domain containing protein)-centered (Fig. 6J) subnetworks, signal interactions mediated by the stress-responsive sRNAs specifically exist in the panicles. Whether stress signal crosstalk could be mediated by these sRNAs, and whether certain signal interactions indeed display panicle- or seedling-specific patterns need further validations.

High-throughput sequencing data sets of rice sRNAs were retrieved from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (Barrett et al., 2009) and the Rice Small RNA Database 2 belonging to the Next-Gen Sequence Databases (http://mpss.udel.edu/rice_sRNA2/index.php?menu=../common/web/library_info.php?SITE=rice_sRNA2&showAll=true) (Nakano et al., 2006). The AGO1-associated sRNA HTS data sets and the rice degradome sequencing data sets were downloaded from GEO. Please refer to Table S1 for the detailed information of these data sets.

The microarray data sets of rice were downloaded from PLEXdb (Plant Expression Database; http://www.plexdb.org/plex.php?database=Rice) (Dash et al., 2012). Specifically, OS10 contains the expression data under specific stress treatments (control, drought, salt and cold) of rice seedlings. Each treatment has three replicates, i.e. OS10_H1, OS10_H2 and OS10_H3 for control, OS10_H4, OS10_H5 and OS10_H6 for drought treatment, OS10_H7, OS10_H8 and OS10_H9 for salt treatment, and OS10_H10, OS10_H11 and OS10_H12 for cold treatment. OS37 contains the expression data under the drought treatment of rice panicles. OS37_H16, OS37_H17 and OS37_H18 are the three replicates of the control sets of panicles, and OS37_H34, OS37_H35 and OS37_H36 are the three replicates of panicles under drought treatment. For both OS10 and OS37, the mean expression value of the three replicates of a specific treatment was calculated for the Affymetrix 57k Rice GeneChip probe of a specific target gene to perform expression data-based analysis.

The miRNA sequences were obtained from miRBase (release 21; http://www.mirbase.org/) (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2008). The transcripts of rice genes and the gene annotations were retrieved from the rice genome annotation project established by the institute for genome research (TIGR rice, release 6.1; http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/index.shtml) (Yuan et al., 2003).

Target prediction was performed by using miRU algorithm (Dai et al., 2011; Zhang, 2005 
                        Zhang, 2005) with default parameters. The degradome sequencing data were utilized to validate the predicted sRNA—target pairs. First, in order to allow cross-library comparison, the normalized read count (in RPM, reads per million) of a short sequence from a specific degradome library was calculated by dividing the raw count of this sequence by the total counts of the library, and then multiplied by 106. Then, two-step filtering was performed to extract the most likely sRNA—target pairs. During the first step, the predicted sRNA binding sites along with the 50-nt surrounding sequences at both ends were collected in order to reduce the BLAST time. For the BLAST, all the collected degradome data sets were utilized at the same time to do a comprehensive search. It was based on the scenario that a sRNA—target pair was considered to be the candidate once the cleavage signal(s) existed in any data set(s). The predicted targets met the following criteria were retained: (1) there must be perfectly matched degradome signatures with their 5′ ends resided within 8–12thnt region from the 5′ ends of the regulatory sRNAs; and (2) for a specific position within the 8–12thnt region, which could be regarded as the potential cleavage site, there must be two or more distinct degradome signatures with accordant 5′ ends to support this position. These retained transcripts were subjected to a second BLAST, and the degradome signals along each transcript were obtained to provide a global view of the signal noise when compared to the signal intensity within a specific target binding site. Referring to our previous study (Meng et al., 2011), both global and local t-plots were drawn. Finally, exhaustive manual filtering was performed, and only the transcripts with cleavage signals easy to be recognized were extracted as the potential sRNA—target pairs.
