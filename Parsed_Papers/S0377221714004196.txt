                  We investigate an automobile supply chain where a manufacturer and a retailer serve a market with a fuel-efficient automobile under a scrappage program by the government. The program awards a subsidy to each consumer who trades in his or her used automobile with a new fuel-efficient automobile, if the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) for the new one does not exceed a cutoff level. We derive the conditions assuring that the manufacturer has an incentive to qualify for the program, and find that when the cutoff level is low, the manufacturer may be unwilling to qualify for the program even if the subsidy is high. We also show that when the manufacturer qualifies for the program, increasing the MSRP cutoff level would raise the manufacturer’s expected profit but may decrease the expected sales. A moderate cutoff level can maximize the effectiveness of the program in stimulating the sales of fuel-efficient automobiles, whereas a sufficiently high cutoff level can result in the largest profit for the manufacturer. The retailer’s profit always increases when the manufacturer chooses to qualify for the program. Furthermore, we compute the government’s optimal MSRP cutoff level and subsidy for a given sales target, and find that as the program budget increases, the government should raise the subsidy but reduce the MSRP cutoff level to maximize sales.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years many scrappage programs have been implemented to encourage the trade-in of old automobiles with more fuel-efficient new automobiles. Such programs generally have the dual aim of stimulating the automobile market and removing inefficient, high-emission automobiles from the road for the purpose of environmental protection. Even though some governments introduced similar programs (e.g., tax rebate programs) in the 1990s, the scrappage program was widely adopted in a number of countries only during the global recession that began in 2008. This happened because the 2008 financial storm heavily influenced the world-wide automobile sector, resulting in an unprecedented automobile industry crisis.

In Table 1
                     , we provide a summary of automobile scrappage programs that have been implemented by the governments of eight countries or regions in Asia, Europe, and North America. Under a scrappage program for automobile, a contingent subsidy is provided to each consumer who trades in his or her old vehicle for a new, more fuel-efficient one that has a combined fuel economy.

Some governments (e.g., Hong Kong, the United States, etc.) have reported that the scrappage program is useful for stimulating the sales of fuel-efficient vehicles. For example, the Environmental Protection Department of Hong Kong prepared HK$3.2 billion for its scrappage program, and announced that this amount had been committed within 18months. As reported by Yacobucci and Canis (2009), the United States appropriated an initial amount of $1 billion for its “Car Allowance Rebate System” (CARS) program to support qualifying transactions. Immediately after the first week of implementing the CARS program, the United States’s Department of Transportation announced that this program was embraced by thousands of consumers and by automobile retailers across the country, and nearly all of the funds appropriated for the CARS program were committed. In a response to the high demand resulting from the CARS program, the House of Representatives decided to make available an additional $2 billion to extend the program. In Slovaks, 62.3% of the total sales realized between March and December 2009 were attributed to the government’s scrappage program; see the IHS Global Insight (2010).

From our above discussion, we find that the scrappage program can be effective in stimulating sales for fuel-efficient automobiles during the economic recession. Hence, it would be important, and interesting, to consider the following relevant questions. First, we need to investigate if the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s profits when the manufacturer qualifies for the scrappage program are higher than those when the manufacturer does not qualify. We note that the government’s target of implementing the scrappage program is to boost the sales of fuel-efficient automobiles for the purpose of reducing harmful emissions and protecting the environment. Accordingly, we examine the conditions under which the program can effectively stimulate the sales. We find from Table 1 that some governments (e.g., Mexico, Slovaks, and the United States) provide their subsidies only to the buyers who purchase new cars each with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) no more than a pre-determined cutoff level, whereas other governments (e.g., China, France, Germany, and Japan) do not set any MSRP cutoff level for their scrappage programs. It thus behooves us to investigate the impact of the MSRP cutoff level and the subsidy amount on the automobile sales. To address our above questions in a general setting, we assume in this paper that the scrappage program for automobile trade-in involves a cutoff level and a subsidy.

We consider a two-echelon supply chain where a manufacturer and a retailer serve consumers with a fuel-efficient automobile under a government’s scrappage program. The manufacturer makes a wholesale pricing decision and, as in the real-world automobile industry (see, e.g., Leaseguide.com, 2011), determines an MSRP as a markup above the wholesale price. In accordance with the practice, the MSRP can be calculated as the manufacturer’s wholesale price plus a markup percentage of the wholesale price. The markup percentage for an automobile uniquely corresponds to a gross profit margin, which, in the past two decades, was usually between 4% and 13% with an average value in the range [6%,8%], as indicated at Leaseguide.com (2011).

The retailer purchases the manufacturer’s automobiles at the wholesale price, and then serves heterogenous consumers in a market of a finite size. That is, there are a certain, finite number of consumers each having a net valuation which is the consumer’s valuation of a new, fuel-efficient automobile minus the valuation of his or her old automobile. To reflect the heterogeneity, we characterize the consumers’ net valuations by a non-negative, finite-valued random variable. As in practice, the retail price for each consumer is determined as a discount of the MSRP, which results from the negotiation between the consumer and the retailer. Accordingly, we analyze the bargaining process to determine the discount of the MSRP and calculate the retail price for each consumer. Since the retailer and the consumer may have different bargaining powers, we apply the generalized Nash bargaining (GNB) scheme—which was developed by Roth (1979)—to analyze the two-player cooperative game and find a unique MSRP discount, which determines the retail price charged to the consumer. For a recent application of GNB in supply chain analysis, see Huang, Leng, Liang, and Liu (2013), who performed a numerical study to analyze automobile supply chains under a subsidy scheme, and Luo, Leng, Huang, and Liang (2014), who analytically investigated a price-discount scheme for an automobile supply chain.

We then use the negotiated retail prices to develop the manufacturer’s profit function, and maximize it to find the manufacturer’s unique optimal wholesale price under a scrappage program. We derive the condition under which the manufacturer can benefit from the program and is thus willing to set an MSRP lower than or equal to the cutoff level and qualify for the program. In addition, we show that, when the manufacturer qualifies for the scrappage program, raising the MSRP cutoff level will result in an increase in the manufacturer’s expected profit but a decrease in the expected sales. Therefore, if the government intends to increase the expected sales for the fuel-efficient automobile, then it should set a moderate value for the MSRP cutoff level. In addition, we find that a small subsidy may be ineffective in stimulating the sales. The government’s optimal subsidy is increasing in its budget, while its optimal MSRP cutoff level is decreasing in the budget.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

This paper is related to two streams of literature. The first stream explores the trade-in subsidies provided by firms. For example, Levinthal and Purohit (1989) investigated a firm’s trade-in scheme for its durable products, and showed that the firm can utilize trade-in rebates to promote an improved product generation by deterring the secondary market. For the trade-in problem by Levinthal and Purohit (1989) and Ackere and Reyniers (1995) found that trade-in rebates can encourage consumers to trade in their used products for new ones. Fudenberg and Tirole (1998) considered the optimal pricing and trade-in rebate decisions for a firm selling its products in a market that involves potential trade-in consumers—who intend to trade in used products for new ones—and potential first-time buyers—who may directly purchase the new products from the firm. Ray, Boyaci, and Aras (2005) also studied the optimal pricing and trade-in strategies for a firm that satisfies an age-dependent demand with durable and remanufactured products. Bruce, Desai, and Staelin (2006) investigated a trade-in problem, and derived the conditions under which the manufacturer of a durable product is willing to offer a cash rebate to each consumer who trades in the used product for a new one. Using prospect theory, Kim, Rao, Kim, and Rao (2011) developed an analytical model to explore consumers’ choices in their trade-ins. Moreover, some researchers addressed the trade-in issues for general durable goods; see Clerides and Hadjiyiannis (2008), Prince (2009) and Rao, Narasimhan, and John (2009).

Our paper differs from this stream of research in that we contribute to the literature by finding (i) the consumers’ purchase decisions and the expected sales, (ii) the negotiated retail price, (iii) the optimal wholesale price, and (iv) the government’s optimal MSRP cutoff level and subsidy that maximize the expected sales. We can find the differences from both managerial and technical perspectives. From the managerial perspective, the trade-in policy implemented by a government primarily aims at stimulating the sales of new fuel-efficient automobiles to reduce 
                        
                           
                              
                                 CO
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                      emissions, whereas the trade-in policy implemented by a firm mainly aims at increasing the firm’s profit. A policy that effectively increases a firm’s profit may not be effective in increasing the sales. From the technical perspective, the firm with its trade-in policy needs to make optimal decisions on price, subsidy, and other policy-related variables. However, when the trade-in subsidy is provided by a government, the firm only makes its optimal pricing decision in response to the government’s scrappage program, for which the government decides on its optimal cutoff level and subsidy that maximize the expected sales.

The second stream of literature is concerned with the scrappage programs (colloquially known as “cash for clunkers”) implemented by governments, under which a subsidy is offered to each consumer who trades in a used automobile for a new one. A number of researchers investigated the environmental and economic consequences of such scrappage programs. For a comprehensive review on the environmental impact of the scrappage programs, see Wee, Jong, and Nijland (2011). Some researchers examined the environmental impact of the scrappage programs from the empirical perspective. For instance, by measuring the efficiency of the program in terms of the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, Morrison, Allan, and Carpenter (2010) and Zolnik (2012) examined the costs generated by the program. Ryan (2012) estimated the efficiency of the scrappage program in pollution reduction. As an alternative to the subsidy, governments may apply tax policies to influence consumers’ trading-in behaviors. Fosgerau and Jensen (2013) considered the effects of the government’s tax reform on 
                        
                           
                              
                                 CO
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                      emissions and social welfare. Brand, Anable, and Tran (2013) and Fullerton and West (2010) considered the combinations of tax and subsidy for the control of car pollution.

Besides the above empirical studies, researchers examined the environmental effects of the scrappage program using various analytical models, which include the discrete analysis (e.g., Adda & Cooper, 2000), mass point duration model (e.g., Chen & Niemeier, 2005), integer program model (e.g., Gao & Stasko, 2009), cost-benefit analysis (e.g., Lavee & Becker, 2009), life cycle optimization model (e.g., Basbagill, Flager, Lepech, & Fischer, 2013; Kim, Keoleian, Grande, & Bean, 2003; Kim, Ross, & Keoleian, 2004; Lenski, Keoleian, & Bolon, 2010; Spitzley, Grande, Keoleian, & Kim, 2005), and others (e.g., Chen, Esteban, & Shum, 2010; Lorentziadis & Vournas, 2011).

Researchers also analytically investigated the economic impact of the scrappage program. For example, Hahn (1995) assessed the likely benefits and costs of the scrappage program, and Alberini, Harrington, and McConnell (1995) modeled the owner’s car tenure and scrappage decision, and forecasted the participation rates in the scrappage program. Incorporating the scrappage cycle length, de Palma and Kilani (2008) presented an economic model to assess the impact of scrap value for old cars and taxes on gasoline. By maximizing the social net benefit, Iwata and Arimura (2009) analyzed the optimal retirement timing of the Japanese program for air pollution regulation. Licanaro and Sampayo (2006) designed a model to quantitatively evaluate Spain’s 1997 scrappage program.

In addition, researchers examined the economic effects using the empirical data in some specific programs. Several studies recently investigated the impact of the US 2009 automobile CARS program (see, Busse, Knittel, Silva-Risso, & Zettelmeyer, 2012; Copeland & Kahn, 2013; Klier & Rubenstein, 2013; Li, Linn, & Spiller, 2013; Li & Wei, 2013; Mian & Sufi, 2012; Yacobucci & Canis, 2009). A recent report by IHS Global Insight (2010) assessed the economic, environmental, and safety impact of the scrappage program implemented by countries in European Union. Aldred and Tepe (2011) considered the scrappage programs in Germany and the UK. Huse and Lucinda (in press) investigated the effects of the Swedish “green car rebate” program on 
                        
                           
                              
                                 CO
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                      emission and the program cost.

Most publications were concerned with empirical study for the scrappage program. Though some researchers developed analytical models for such a program, our analytical work still significantly differs from them in several aspects.
                        
                           1.
                           The government’s scrappage program under our study involves an MSRP cutoff level (in addition to a subsidy). To the best of our knowledge, no existent publication has analytically considered such a cutoff level for any scrappage scheme, which is actually important to the program’s effectiveness in stimulating the sales because of the following fact. The cutoff level could lead consumers to buy qualifying automobiles—i.e., those with MSRPs lower than or equal to the cutoff level—and obtain the subsidy from the government. Manufacturers may respond to consumers’ purchase behaviors by reducing their wholesale prices and MSRPs to qualify for the scrappage program. Thus, the choice of the cutoff level affects the effectiveness of the scrappage program. It behooves us to consider the scrappage program including the MSRP cutoff level and the subsidy. This saliently distinguishes our paper from extant publications.

The modeling approach in our paper differs from that in any existent publication. None of the publications regarding the government’s scrappage program analyzed consumers’ trade-in decisions, which is, however, important because the program aims at encouraging consumers to buy qualifying automobiles. In this paper, we consider each consumer’s purchase decision by using the generalized Nash bargaining (GNB) scheme to compute the retail price that is negotiated by the retailer and the consumer. This differs from most extant publications which (i) ignored consumers’ behaviors in their automobile transactions, (ii) allowed the retailer to unilaterally decide on an optimal retail price maximizing the retailer’s individual profit, and (iii) presumed that consumers in all successful transactions accept the retail price. Moreover, we allow heterogeneity in consumers’ valuations, which is important because it enables us to investigate how the scrappage program entices low-valuation consumers to trade in their used automobiles. Thus, compared with relevant publications, the modeling approach in our paper is more realistic. Using our analytical results characterizing consumers’ purchase behaviors, we derive a demand function, which is expected to analytically describe automobile sales in an accurate manner.

Our realistic model and analysis for the scrappage program that has appeared in real life generate a number of new managerial insights that have not been found in extant publications. For a summary of our new insights, see Section 7.

We consider a two-level automobile supply chain in the presence of a scrappage program, where a manufacturer produces a fuel-efficient automobile—that meets relevant requirements in the scrappage program—at the unit acquisition cost c. The manufacturer sells its products to a retailer in a market at the wholesale price w.

In practice, an automobile manufacturer usually recommends to its retailers a suggested retail price 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 s
                              
                           
                        
                      which is commonly calculated as the manufacturer’s wholesale price plus a markup percentage (
                        
                           ρ
                           ⩾

                     ) of the wholesale price—i.e., 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 s
                              
                           
                           =

                           1

                           ρ
                           )
                           w
                        
                     —as indicated by a large number of facts in the automobile industry, see, e.g., Martí (2000), Biz.Yahoo.Com (2011) and Leaseguide.com (2011). Note that some firms may use the concept of “gross margin” instead of the markup percentage to calculate the MSRP. In fact, the gross margin and the markup percentage uniquely correspond to each other, such that the gross margin is equal to 
                        
                           ρ
                           /
                           (
                           1
                           +
                           ρ
                           )
                        
                      and the value of 
                        
                           ρ
                        
                      can be found as (profit margin)/(1−profit margin). Therefore, using the markup percentage to determine the MSRP does not result in any loss of generality of our model and analysis.

The above discussion indicates that, in the automobile industry, the MSRP actually reflects a markup ceiling that a manufacturer allows its retailer to take; for details, see, e.g., a case report by Martí (2000). Since the MSRP of the automobile is known to consumers, the actual retail prices are usually not higher than the MSRP, because the retail price charged to a consumer is commonly determined as the result of negotiation between the retailer and the consumer over a discount from the MSRP. Therefore, we can calculate the retail price

In our paper, the market that the retailer serves has a finite consumer base B consisting of all potential consumers who may trade in their old automobiles for new ones. Moreover, each consumer in the market only buys one unit of automobile in a transaction. Consumers on the base B may have different valuations over their used automobiles; they may also draw different valuations from the new automobile. To reflect the fact, we assume the heterogeneity of consumers’ net trade-in valuations. We define a consumer’s net trade-in valuation as the consumer’s valuation of the new automobile minus his or her valuation of the used automobile. The heterogeneous net valuations of consumers are characterized by a non-negative random parameter

                           θ

                     ] possibly plus the subsidy s. Since whether or not the consumer can get the subsidy s depends on the comparison between the cutoff level A and the MSRP

                           A
                           ,
                           s
                           )
                        
                     , the manufacturer first determines its wholesale price w and releases it to the retailer, who then bargains with each consumer over a retail price. The MSRP 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 s
                              
                           
                        
                      is visible to all consumers in their price negotiations. Such a decision process is depicted by Fig. 1
                     , where the arrow between the manufacturer and retailer denotes that the wholesale price w is unilaterally determined by the manufacturer, and the double-head arrow between the retailer and a consumer represents that the retail price p is determined as a result of the bargaining between the retailer and the consumer.

To help readers easily follow our modeling and analysis, we summarize the notations used in this paper in Table 2
                     .

We investigate the price negotiation between the retailer and a consumer with a specific net valuation 
                        
                           θ
                        
                     , who bargain over the discount 
                        
                           α
                        
                      of the MSRP 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 s
                              
                           
                        
                     , given the scrappage program 
                        
                           (
                           A
                           ,
                           s

                      and the manufacturer’s wholesale price w. The bargaining issue is important to our paper mainly because of the following fact. If we do not consider the bargaining issue to find the negotiated retail price but determine the optimal retail price by maximizing the retailer’s expected profit, then there will be a unique retail price for all consumers, which prevents the consumers with low valuations from buying. This results in underestimation of the expected sales and the total carbon emission reduction, because as a result of price negotiation, those low-valuation consumers may purchase automobiles at lower retail prices. That is, ignoring the bargaining issue can undervalue the impact of the government’s scrappage program on the sales and the automobile supply chain.

Since, in practice, the retailer and each consumer may have different bargaining powers, we use the generalized Nash bargaining (GNB) scheme—developed by Roth (1979)—to find the negotiated discount and retail price for the two players. In our bargaining problem, without loss of generality, we assume that the consumer is player 1 with the bargaining power 
                        
                           β
                        
                      and the retailer is player 2 with the bargaining power 
                        
                           1
                           -
                           β
                        
                     . Consumers may possess different bargaining powers when negotiating with the retailer. To incorporate the heterogeneity of consumers in their bargaining powers, we assume that 
                        
                           β
                        
                      is a random variable with the p.d.f. 
                        
                           g

                           β

                         is continuously differentiable and log-concave. Such a condition is acceptable, because, as Bagnoli and Bergstrom (2005) showed, many commonly-used distributions—e.g., uniform, normal, exponential, logistic, Laplace (double exponential), Weibull, Gamma, etc.—satisfy the condition. To that end, we assume that the p.d.f. 
                           
                              f

                         possesses the properties of continuous differentiability and log-concavity.

                              , then the expected sales, and the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s expected profits are strictly increasing in the subsidy s. In addition, the total subsidy cost is increasing in s.
                           

The above theorem implies that both the manufacturer and the retailer can benefit from an increase in the subsidy s, when the government chooses a sufficiently high cutoff level such that

                        . Though, the government may not need to choose a very large subsidy because, otherwise, it will incur a high “expense”

                        , which is considered as an “input” for implementing the scrappage program. Recall from Section 1 that some governments (e.g., China, France, Germany, Greece, and Japan) do not involve any cutoff level into their scrappage programs, so that each consumer can obtain a subsidy no matter what retail price the manufacturer suggests. That is, for those governments’ scrappage programs, the cutoff level in our model is set as the maximum value

                              s
                           
                        . Even though other governments (e.g., Mexico, Slovaks, and the United States) explicitly apply cutoff levels to their programs, we find that those cutoff levels are significantly higher than the suggested prices of qualifying automobiles. For example, the US government’s cutoff level for its scrappage program is $45,000, as indicated by Table 1. According to the report by Insight (2010), which is a leading global source of critical information and insight, the average MSRP for new vehicles under the US scrappage program was $22,450, which is significantly lower than the cutoff level $45,000.

The above corollary means that, if no cutoff level is involved into a scrappage program implemented by, e.g., China, France, Germany, etc., then the resulting wholesale price is greater than that in the absence of the program. That is, the scrappage program may result in an increase in the wholesale price.

Using our analytic results in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, we now derive the manufacturer’s globally optimal wholesale price maximizing its expected profit under no constraint, in the presence of the government’s scrappage program 
                           
                              (

                              )
                           
                        . To do so, we need to compare the manufacturer’s maximum profit when 
                           
                              w

                         (the manufacturer qualifies for the scrappage program) and that when

In this section, we perform analytical and numerical sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of the MSRP cutoff level A, the subsidy s, and the MSRP markup percentage

                      on the manufacturer’s optimal wholesale price, the expected sales, and the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s maximum expected profits. Moreover, we find the government’s optimal cutoff level and subsidy decisions that maximize the expected sales.

We first investigate the impact of A and s, and then derive the government’s optimal decisions.

We learn from Theorem 5 that if A is sufficiently low, then the manufacturer may be unwilling to reduce its wholesale price and MSRP to qualify for the scrappage program. This occurs possibly because qualifying for the program with a low cutoff level may deteriorate the manufacturer’s profit margin. As a result, all consumers who buy the manufacturer’s automobiles cannot get the subsidy, which means that the scrappage program is ineffective in increasing the sales and reducing air pollution. Therefore, it is important to execute a proper trade-in scheme for the automobile scrappage. Next, we analytically derive the minimum MSRP cutoff level that induces the manufacturer to qualify for the scrappage program.

                            and is unwilling to qualify for the scrappage program. This happens because of the following fact: If the manufacturer reduces its wholesale price, then more consumers are willing to buy and the expected sales are increased. But, when the cutoff level A is small, reducing the wholesale price to satisfy

As a result, when A is in Zone 1, the manufacturer is worse off from reducing its wholesale price, thereby keeping the wholesale price as

Moreover, such a price reduction generates a significant increase in the expected sales (i.e., an upward jump in Fig. 2(b)), which causes an increase in the retailer’s expected profit (i.e., an upward jump in Fig. 2(d)). However, there is no jump in the manufacturer’s expected profit at the boundary between two zones, as indicated in Fig. 2(c). This happens because, as Theorem 6 shows, at the boundary (i.e.,

Such a result follows the fact that if the cutoff level is higher than the minimum level (for the manufacturer’s program qualification) but lower than a sufficiently large value (that does not influence the manufacturer’s wholesale pricing decision), then the manufacturer intends to raise its wholesale price to attain a higher expected profit while qualifying for the scrappage program. Though, an increase in the wholesale price does not significantly reduce the expected sales, as indicated by Fig. 2(b), because the government’s subsidy s awarded to each consumer helps alleviate the negative impact of the price increase on the sales.

                           . Accordingly, any further increase in A has no impact on the optimal wholesale price, the expected sales, and the manufacturer’s and retailer’s expected profits. The reason is given as follows: if the manufacturer further increases its wholesale price, then the subsidy for a consumer cannot help reduce the consumer’s purchase cost and the sales are thus significantly reduced. Therefore, the manufacturer does not change its wholesale price; and the expected sales, and the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s expected profits are unchanged. The corresponding curves in Fig. 2 are thus horizontal lines.

The effect of A on the expected sales in Zone 2 also implies that, compared with a scrappage program with a subsidy only (i.e., the MSRP cutoff level A is infinitely large), a program with a moderate value of the cutoff level is more effective in reducing the wholesale price and thus boosting the sales of fuel efficient automobiles. For example, comparing the expected sales when

                           . Any further increase in A cannot improve its profit any more. This means that the manufacturer’s expectation on the value of the cutoff level significantly differs from the government’s optimal cutoff level that maximizes the expected sales. Since the scrappage program is implemented mainly to control carbon emissions and protect the environment, we next discuss the impact of the sales of the fuel efficient automobile on the reduction in

                            emissions. According to Sachs (2009) and Zolnik (2012), we can roughly estimate the reduction in

Specifically, new fuel-efficient automobiles can run 24.9miles per gallon (mpg) on average, whereas the average mpg for trade-in automobiles is 15.8. This means that the average difference in fuel efficiency between new and used automobiles is

                            mpg. Assuming that an automobile can run for 12,000miles per year, we find that the new and used automobiles need 482 and 759 gallons of gasoline, respectively.

                            is increasing in the subsidy s, we find that if the government increases its subsidy s to a sufficiently high level, then the manufacturer certainly has an incentive to qualify for the scrappage program and obtain a greater profit. A critical question then arises as follows: What is the minimum subsidy assuring that the manufacturer chooses to qualify for the scrappage program?

Accordingly, if both the MSRP cutoff level and the subsidy are sufficiently low, then the scrappage program may be ineffective, because the manufacturer is unwilling to reduce its wholesale price and MSRP to qualify for the program. It follows that a government’s scrappage program with a sufficiently high value of A (e.g.,

                           ) is likely to be effective even if the subsidy s is not large. This result is in agreement with the practice that some governments (e.g., Mexico, Slovaks, and the United States) implement a significantly high cutoff level, and other governments (e.g., China, France, Germany, and Japan) do not set any cutoff level. Moreover, another important reason why the governments are willing to increase the cutoff level rather than the subsidy is that awarding a large subsidy to consumers may bring a heavy financial burden to the governments.

However, even if the cutoff level A is so high that the manufacturer decides to qualify for the scrappage program, the expected sales and the manufacturer’s expected profit cannot be significantly improved when the subsidy is very low. According to Theorem 3, we find that when 
                              
                                 A

                           , both the manufacturer’s expected profit and the expected sales are increasing in s. This means that, keeping A unchanged, the government can raise its subsidy to increase the manufacturer’s expected profit and the expected sales, which can entice the manufacturer to qualify for the scrappage program. In fact, we find from Theorem 6 that

                           . Since a very large subsidy may cause a heavy financial burden, the government should determine a proper value of subsidy subject to its budget constraint. This can be demonstrated by the practice in China: In June 2009, a nationwide scrappage program was implemented to offer subsidies of RMB3000—RMB6000 (equivalently, US$450—US$900) to consumers who trade in used heavy polluting automobiles or trucks for new ones. However, this program could only result in a little success in the first several months; hence, the Chinese government raised its subsidy to RMB5000—RMB18,000 (equivalently, US$750—US$2700). The new scrappage program was proved to be effective, because, until October 2010, the number of replaced automobiles had been

Therefore, we observe jumps at the boundary between Zone 1 and Zone 2 in Fig. 3(a), (b), and (d). We note from Theorem 7 that at

                           . As s increases, the manufacturer has no incentive to reduce its wholesale price because the manufacturer intends to assure its profit margin while each consumer enjoys a greater net gain. In addition, when the government increases s, the manufacturer does not increase its wholesale price because, otherwise, the manufacturer will not qualify for the program. Therefore, the manufacturer’s optimal wholesale price is independent of s when 
                              
                                 s

                           , as indicated by Fig. 3(a). As a result, increasing the value of s can entice more low-valuation consumers to trade in their used automobiles, which implies that the expected sales are increasing in s; see Fig. 3(b). Since the manufacturer’s profit margin is not reduced (as argued above), its expected profit is increasing in s, as shown in Fig. 3(c). In addition, a higher subsidy helps raise the retail price and thus improve the retailer’s profit margin. It follows that the retailer’s expected profit increases as the value of s rises, as depicted in Fig. 3(d).

From the above, we find that even when the government sets a sufficiently high cutoff level A, the subsidy is still helpful to increase the sales of fuel-efficient automobiles for reducing

                           , increasing s does not significantly raise the sales and two firms’ expected profits, compared with the impact of A. In fact, a larger subsidy benefits the high-valuation consumers but is not significantly effective in attracting low-valuation consumers to buy. Therefore, the government incurs a high subsidy cost without saliently improving the sales. This suggests that the government needs to implement an appropriate MSRP cutoff level but may not need to apply a very large subsidy.

For example, the budget for the US government’s “CARS” scrappage program was $3.0billion, and the German government afforded its scrappage program with a total amount of about $7billion (€5billion); see Aldred and Tepe (2011) and Lenski et al. (2010). It thus behooves us to consider the following important question. Given a budget for the government’s scrappage program, what are the government’s optimal MSRP cutoff level and subsidy that maximize the expected sales?

We recall from Section 6.1.1 that given a subsidy s, in order to maximize the sales, the government should set the MSRP cutoff level at

This result may be surprising because the government could respond to a higher budget by decreasing its cutoff level to encourage the manufacturer to reduce its wholesale price—see Fig. 4(d)—and qualify for the program, thus improving sales.

                         greatly influences the manufacturer’s decision on whether or not to qualify for the scrappage program. That is, the manufacturer with a larger value of 
                           
                              ρ
                           
                         has less incentive to qualify for the program, which means that the program is less likely to be effective.

                         (Zone 1), the manufacturer loses its incentive to qualify for the scrappage program, because the manufacturer needs to determine a significantly low wholesale price to qualify for the program. To assure the profit margin, the manufacturer keeps its wholesale price at a high level as

                        . As a result, no consumer enjoys a subsidy from the government, which entails a large decrease in the number of consumers trading in their used automobiles. The decrease in the expected sales generates a large decrease in the retailer’s expected profit. Therefore, there appear the jumps at the boundary between Zone 1 and Zone 2 in Fig. 5(a), (b), and (d). Moreover, the manufacturer’s and retailer’s expected profits in Zone 1 are lower than those in Zone 2, as shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d). Moreover, Fig. 5(d) indicates that the retailer’s profit reaches its maximum value when

                        , and thus the expected sales and the manufacturer’s expected profit do not depend on 
                           
                              ρ
                           
                        , which are represented by the horizontal lines in Fig. 5(a)–(c). However, the retailer’s profit is increasing in 
                           
                              ρ
                           
                         because an increase in 
                           
                              ρ
                           
                         generates a higher value of the MSRP and then increases the retailer’s profit margin that is dependent on the MSRP.

From the above, we conclude that even when the government chooses a sufficiently high cutoff level A (as discussed in Section 6.1.1) and a proper subsidy s (as discussed in Section 6.1.2), the manufacturer may not benefit from the scrappage program, because, for the case of a large MSRP markup percentage 
                           
                              ρ
                           
                        , the manufacturer does not intend to reduce the wholesale price to qualify for the scrappage program.

In this paper, we considered a two-level automobile supply chain, where a manufacturer and a retailer serve heterogeneous consumers in a fuel-efficient automobile market under a government’s scrappage program involving a cutoff level and a subsidy. We examined the impact of the program on the government’s optimal decisions, the manufacturer’s optimal wholesale price, the negotiated retail price, and consumers’ purchase decisions. Since the retail price charged to a consumer is determined as a result of the negotiation between the consumer and the retailer, who may have different bargaining powers, we used the GNB concept to characterize the negotiated retail price. We then developed the manufacturer’s expected profit function, which was maximized to find the optimal wholesale price for the manufacturer. In addition, we compared the optimal wholesale price, the expected sales, and the manufacturer’s and retailer’s expected profits under the scrappage program and those in the absence of such a program. We also investigated the impact of the MSRP cutoff level, the subsidy, the government’s budget, and the markup percentage (that was used to calculate the MSRP) on the manufacturer’s optimal pricing decision, the expected sales, the manufacturer’s and retailer’s expected profits, and the government’s optimal decisions.

We summarize our major managerial insights as follows:

                               can result in higher sales, it also increases the government’s cost. Thus, the optimal subsidy should be determined according to the target sales that the government expects the manufacturer to achieve.

Given the government’s sales target, we can uniquely compute the optimal MSRP cutoff level and subsidy, and find the corresponding budget for the government. The government’s optimal subsidy is increasing in the government’s budget, while its optimal MSRP cutoff level is decreasing in the budget. This may be a surprising insight because the government could respond to a higher budget by raising its cutoff level to encourage the manufacturer to qualify for the program and thus improving sales. Moreover, the expected sales are increasing in the budget but at a decreasing rate, which implies that a larger budget may not help the scrappage program saliently increase the sales.

Given a scrappage program, there exists a maximum markup percentage

                              , the manufacturer’s expected profit is decreasing in 
                                 
                                    ρ
                                 
                              , while the expected sales and the retailer’s profit are increasing in 
                                 
                                    ρ
                                 
                              . The manufacturer with a smaller markup percentage 
                                 
                                    ρ
                                 
                               is more likely to reduce its wholesale price and qualify for the scrappage program. The insight is important since the government needs to understand which manufacturers are more likely to qualify for its scrappage program.

In conclusion, we find that the scrappage program with a sufficiently large MSRP cutoff level and a proper subsidy is useful to stimulating the sales of fuel-efficient automobiles, and also increasing the profitability of the automobile manufacturer, who thus has an incentive to qualify for the program. Moreover, for the scrappage program, the government’s optimal cutoff level and subsidy that maximize the expected sales depend on the budget for such a program.

In future, some research directions may be worth considering. First, we may investigate the scrappage program in a dynamic, temporal setting, focusing on its impact on the manufacturer’s future pricing decisions, its long-run average profit, and the expected sales. Secondly, it could be important for the manufacturer to consider the investment in its product design. Since the government implements a program to encourage the use of fuel-efficient automobiles, we may need to investigate if and how the program can induce the manufacturer to invest in designing a green automobile for environment protection. Thirdly, in practice a consumer may be willing to sell his or her used automobile in a secondary market instead of trading it in. In another research direction, we may consider the supply chain when a government’s scrappage program and a secondary market jointly exist, and examine if and how the existence of the secondary market impacts the manufacturer’s decisions and the effectiveness of the government’s scrappage program in stimulating consumers’ trade-ins.
