                  In the recent article, Darwish and Odah (2010) develop a scheme that allows for identical replenishment cycles for all the retailers, in the context of a single vendor supplying a group of retailers under VMI partnership. This paper proposes an alternative replenishment scheme allowing for different replenishment cycles for each retailer. An example has been shown to illustrate the cost savings under the proposed model.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The benefits of Vendor managed Inventory in terms of reduced cost and improved service are clearly stated by Waller, Eric Johnson, and Davis (1999). Since then many authors have tried to come up with single vendor multi retailer replenishment schemes. Viswanathan and Piplani (2001) propose a scheme where the replenishment cycle for supplier is fixed and retailers may order at those intervals only. Zhanga, Lianga, Yua, and Yu (2007) present a model wherein the vendor has constant production cycle and retailers can have different ordering cycles. Hariga, Gumus, Daghfous, and Goyal (2013) take unequal reorder intervals for vendor, and retailers can receive more than one shipment in each vendor cycle. Recently in their paper entitled “Vendor managed inventory model for single-vendor multi-retailer supply chains”, Darwish and Odah (2010) present a mathematical model for retailer replenishment and provide an optimal solution for the same. In developing the model, they consider a policy of replenishing all retailers at the same time. They assume that each retailer gets replenished every T periods and the supplier sets up every nT period, where n is an integer greater than equal to 1. In this note, we show that changing the replenishment policy may lead to cost savings. Specifically, we assume that the retailers are not replenished simultaneously, instead, a retailer i is replenished every miT period, where, T is the base replenishment cycle, and mi
                      is an integer. The solution methodology ensures that at least one retailer is replenished every T period and the others may be replenished every T, 2T, 3T, etc. periods. We further assume that the supplier sets up every T periods and unlike Darwish and Odah (2010) supplier does not carry any inventory. Thus, n is assumed to be 1 in our case. Such an assumption of lot for lot replenishment may be found in literature (Banerjee, 1986; Monahan, 1984). This is applicable when the supplier is a cross-dock warehouse; alternatively, the supplier is a manufacturer with infinite capacity. This replenishment policy does not force every retailer to be replenished every cycle. Our proposed policy can be seen as a generalization of the policy adopted by Darwish and Odah (2010), to the extent that, for mi
                     
                     =1, for all i, all retailers would get replenished every T period. Our proposed policy can be found in Silver (1976), who has used it in the context of joint replenishment of items.

                     The factor that controls the cycle time of a retailer is ai
                     /Dihi
                     . The higher this ratio, the higher is the value of mi
                     , and vice versa. We identify the retailer with the lowest ai
                     /Dihi
                      ratio and set the value of mi
                      of the retailer equal to 1. This ensures that at least one retailer is replenished every cycle. We have used the software ‘Lingo 13.0’ to solve for values of other mi
                     ’s and T. The replenishment quantities for retailers are calculated as Qi
                     
                     =
                     Di mi T.

The example considered by Darwish and Odah (2010) is such that the (ai
                     /Dihi
                     ) ratio for all the retailers are very close, suggesting that the replenishment cycle for the items should be similar and in turn all the mi
                     ’s come out to be 1. This is shown in the table given below:

As mentioned, the retailer with the lowest value of ai
                     /Dihi
                      (say Rlowest) will get replenished every cycle. In a similar way the supplier’s A/Dhs
                      ratio controls its replenishment cycle. A lower value of A/Dhs
                      ratio should lead to a lower value of n. Moreover, n will take a value of more than 1, only in the case where A/Dhs
                      ratio of supplier is relatively much higher as compared to ai
                     /Dihi
                      ratio of Rlowest. Such a case arises in the context of single supplier – single retailer situation, as the setup cost of the supplier is relatively higher compared to the ordering cost of the retailer. However in the context of multiple retailers, the supplier’s A/Dhs
                      ratio is either close to or less than ai
                     /Dihi
                      ratio of Rlowest (since D is now the cumulative demand of all retailers taken together) and hence the assumption of n
                     =1 is justifiable. In the example considered by Darwish and Odah (2010) 
                     A/Dhs
                      has been taken as 0.044, which is more than ai
                     /Dihi
                      of any of the retailer suggesting lower frequency of setups and hence supporting n greater than 1.

The example and the resulting cost savings are shown in the next section.

Consider a case involving four retailers and one supplier with the input data shown in Table 1
                     .

The value for m4 (Retailer 4 has lowest value for ai
                     /Dihi
                     ) is set to 1 and then the other values are obtained using LINGO 13.0, as shown in Table 2
                     .

For the same example, using the model and algorithm suggested by Darwish and Odah (2010), the value of n came out to be 1 as a result, the supplier’s inventory carrying cost in Darwish and Odah (2010) case also comes out to be zero; the other results are given in Table 3
                     .

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The factor ai
                     /Dihi
                      plays an important role in realizing the benefit of different replenishment cycle for retailers. We show that allowing different replenishment cycles for the retailers results in the reduction of total relevant cost as compared to the scenario where all the retailers are restricted to have the same replenishment cycle. In the context where the retailers are heterogeneous with respect to the factors such as demand, ordering cost, and inventory carrying cost the proposed model will perform better as compared to the model suggested by Darwish and Odah (2010).
