                  Signals associated with eye blinks (230–350 micro-volts) are orders of magnitude larger than electric potentials (7–20 micro-volts) generated on the scalp because of cortical activity. These and other such non-cortical biological artifacts spread across the scalp and contaminate the Electroencephalogram (EEG). We present here a novel approach for efficient detection and effective suppression of these artifacts using single channel EEG data by combining Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We present a methodology for ocular artifact suppression, by performing EEMD on the contaminated EEG data segment to get the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and subsequent elimination of artifacts by automatic selection of particular principal components, which capture ocular artifact features after using PCA on IMFs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive measurement of neuronal electrical activity which gives an insight into the functioning of the brain. EEG signals are measured from the scalp either with electrodes in the standard 10–20 arrangement or an extended 10–20 system (64 electrodes), following a standard devised by the International Federation of Societies of EEG [1]. EEG signals are often contaminated by potentials of non-cerebral origin such as those associated with eye-blink; these signals are called Electrooculogram (EOG) signals. These artifact signals pose a serious problem as brain signals are relatively smaller [2]. For example, eye blinks result in potential differences over the scalp which are often large enough to make the interpretation of the EEG difficult. Generally portions of the EEG time series, which are contaminated by EOG and other artifacts, are rejected in long duration recordings but cannot be rejected in shorter recordings as it will lead to a substantial loss of data. Several different techniques like regression techniques [3], Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [4–6] and wavelet [7] based approach have been suggested to eliminate the relatively common biological artifacts. Regression is a relatively simple way to remove ocular artifacts by projecting the measured EOG signal on the EEG channels. However, this method might produce unexpected artifacts in the data due to bidirectional contamination [8]. ICA has been used in the artifact rejection problem [9–11] but it requires careful selection of the number of independent components which have to be eliminated [12,13]. Some studies have also proposed the hybrid methodology of combining ICA with the regression or with the wavelet based approach [14,15] but since such methodologies are based on multi-channel data, they are not suitable for the ocular artifact suppression using single channel EEG data. On the other hand, wavelet is a relatively simpler technique due to its optimal resolution both in the time and in the frequency domains for the elimination of artifacts. However the wavelet based techniques rely on predefined basis functions for the decomposition of the recorded signal. More recently, techniques based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) have been developed, especially for the analysis of non-linear and non-stationary signals [16–19]. Such a decomposition is based on the idea of locally extracting fine scale fluctuations in a signal and iterating the procedure on the (locally lower scale) residual. EMD is an adaptive and unsupervised method since the basis functions are derived from the data itself. EMD decomposes the data into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) through a sifting process and a linear combination of IMFs yields the original signal. Comparative studies [20] have shown that the performance of EMD is often superior to that of the wavelet based approach in reliably extracting biomedical signals. Recently, some studies [21,22] have used EMD for ocular artifact removal, but their methods required calculation of a metric such as energy or entropy of the IMFs obtained by performing EMD on slightly larger time window (3 s) of contaminated EEG data; besides, these works did not offer a systematic methodology for ocular artifact detection or a comparison of performance of the proposed artifact elimination techniques with the conventionally used wavelet approach for single channel data. While EMD has a distinct advantage (of using basis functions adapted to the data) over wavelet and other signal denoising techniques, it has the disadvantage of mode mixing. The mode mixing (existence of different time scales in a single IMF or the same time scale in different IMFs) arises due to intermittency. To circumvent this, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) approach was proposed. In the EEMD, a finite amplitude of normally distributed white noise is added to the signal in each trial before EMD is performed and the ensemble average of IMFs is taken. The noise is reduced when sufficient number of trials are averaged, since the noise in each trial is uncorrelated and thus the ensemble mean may be taken to represent the true signal. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new ocular artifact suppression methodology based on a single channel EEG data by automatically retaining only those principal components which extract the features corresponding to the ocular artifacts after applying PCA on the IMFs.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 highlights a brief introduction to EEMD and PCA; Section 3 introduces the experimental protocol and provides an overview of the existing approaches for artifact detection and elimination; Section 4 presents the proposed approach for ocular artifact suppression based on single channel EEG data. Finally, Section 5, provides the concluding remarks with potential directions for future work.

EMD is an algorithm used for the analysis of multi-component signals that breaks them down into a number of amplitude and frequency modulated (AM/FM) zero-mean signals, termed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The following criteria have to be satisfied for a set of functions to be designated as IMFs:

(i) The number of extrema and the number of zero crossings must be equal or can differ at most by one.

(ii) The mean value of the envelope defined by local maxima and local minima, at any location, must be zero (i.e., envelopes should be symmetric with respect to zero).

Unlike wavelet based techniques, EMD has the distinct advantage that it does not rely on a set of predefined basis functions and derives the basis functions, known as Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF), adaptively from the data itself [23]. This method is, however, prone to mode mixing, especially when the noise is present intermittently. To overcome this issue, a suitable amplitude of white noise is added in each trial in the EEMD analysis to prevent mode mixing; the noise tends to cancel when ensemble averaged since no correlation exists between the noise introduced at different trials. It has been reported that the optimum amplitude of the noise to be added is in the range 0.1 - 0.4 times the standard deviation of the signal [24]. For all the studies discussed here, we fix the maximum number of trials for the ensemble average to be 200 and added noise is about 0.4 times standard deviation of the signal (this is found to be sufficient in most cases).

PCA has been widely used in many applications for feature extraction and dimensional reduction for multichannel data. The principal component analysis transforms the original variables into new principal components (PCs), which are orthogonal, so that the data decomposed in terms of these components are uncorrelated with each other; therefore, PCA expresses as much as possible of the total variation in the data using only a few principal components and each successively derived PC expresses progressively decreasing amounts of the variation.

In this work, this artifact suppression has been implemented using an open source software Python [25–27].

A total of 10 subjects took part in the visual evoked EEG experiment, out of which eight were males and two were females. The subjects belonged to the age group of 23 to 45 years; written informed consent for participation was taken from all the subjects. The experimental protocol consisted of EEG recording with a full field checkerboard stimulus with a pattern reversal at the rate of 1 Hz. A 64 channels Neuro-Scan system (10–20 extended system) was used for acquiring EEG signals from the brain. The system is equipped with a 24 bit resolution data acquisition card. EEG recordings were carried out with a sampling rate of 1 kHz and the allowable bandwidth was set from DC to 200 Hz. Separate electrodes were used to acquire the EOG signals for checking one to one correspondence with contaminated EEG segments but were not used for further data analysis.

We have used metrics such as variance and absolute value of skewness for identification of eye-blink artifact for each epoched data segment of one second duration [28].

                        Owing to the fact that the eye-blinks are higher in amplitude than the EEG signals, the contaminated EEG segments are expected to show higher variance compared to the uncontaminated segments.

                        A higher absolute value of skewness is expected to indicate the presence of eye-blinks or other artifacts such as muscle activity.

Artifact detection was performed on every one second of recorded data based on statistical properties as described earlier. Once an artifact was detected, a template was extracted from the artifact contaminated segment by first finding the maximum value in that particular contaminated segment and then sliding the predefined window with respect to occurrence of the maximum value in such a manner that a complete segment of an artifact can be captured within the window. The average length of an eye-blink is 100–400 ms [29] and the average time between eye-blinks is 2–3 s [30]. We fixed our sliding window width to 800 ms in such a way that the maximum value of a particular contaminated segment gets always aligned to 200 ms. Use of such a sliding window is intended to ensure that the EOG artifact is not missed or misinterpreted, in case only a small part of the artifact was captured in any one second of the data during the detection process.

The goal of the artifact suppression algorithm is to eliminate the artifact without affecting the brain signals. To evaluate quantitatively the performance of the proposed artifact suppression algorithm with that of the wavelet based approach, the degree of distortion or change in power spectral density (PSD) across different frequency bands and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are compared before and after artifact suppression [31]. The change in PSD (ΔP) is calculated for the brain rhythms, namely delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (12–30 Hz). RMSE is calculated in the interval of 600–700 ms (where effect of eye-blink is expected to be nearly negligible).

                     where, scontaminated
                      is the contaminated EEG segment and scleaned
                      is the cleaned EEG segment after extracting ocular artifact. Lower the value of RMSE and ΔP (in different frequency bands), less will be the distortions in the underlying cerebral activity.

EOG interference was dominant in the frontal lobe electrodes FP1, FP2, F8, FZ and FT8. Fig. 1
                         shows a section of the time trace from the EOG electrode and the corresponding section of the time trace of EEG (contaminated with EOG), viz. from the frontal FP2 electrode, which was used for the analysis. For every case, the data set was converted from continuous format (.cnt) to ASCII format (.dat) to make use of Python for further analysis. The applied methodology is summarized in the following steps:

                           
                              1.
                              The values of variance and absolute skewness were calculated for contaminated and uncontaminated EEG data segments from the different subjects; we find that by selecting a threshold value of ≥ 40 (microvolt square) and ≥ 0.8 for the variance and the absolute skewness respectively, it was possible to detect efficiently most of the ocular artifacts.

After capturing an artifact completely, EEMD was performed on each section of the contaminated EEG signal (FP2) as shown in Fig. 2a
                                  and 2b to get the IMFs. We have determined the principal components and arranged them in decreasing order of their respective variation after performing PCA on the IMFs. We reconstructed the signal by progressively increasing the number of principal components retained and calculated RMSE after adding one more principal component in each step. Parameters of the algorithm (optimum number of PCs to extract ocular artifact features) were systematically varied to investigate the artifact elimination performance in each case. We have compared the RMSE and the peak amplitude of the extracted EOG when the number of PCs retained was varied from 1 to 5 as shown in Fig. 3
                                 .

The lowest value of the RMSE was adopted as the criteria for retaining the optimum number of principal components. This was done to extract the features of the EOG alone in the retained principal components with little distortion in the brain signal. Fig. 4
                                  shows the cleaned and extracted EOG using the proposed method from a contaminated EEG segment.

We found that only 2 or 3 PCs were sufficient to extract EOG features from the data corresponding to all the subjects which was contaminated by the eye-blinks. We have compared the performance of the proposed method with the conventional wavelet based technique. Since the range of frequency for ocular artifact is 0–2.5 Hz, it is necessary to compute the wavelet decomposition level corresponding to this range while using conventional wavelet based artifact suppression methods. In our case,
                      since bandwidth allowed is from 0 to 200 Hz, a decomposition upto sixth level was selected. Fig. 5 shows the clean EEG after extracting the ocular artifact using stationary wavelet transform with Symlet (sym3) as a basis function [32]. Table 1 shows that the proposed method is superior in extracting the ocular artifact with minimum distortion for all the quantification metrics (except those of ΔP in alpha band only) as compared to the conventional wavelet based approach. We were able to detect correctly the occurrence of all EOG artifacts in the contaminated EEG data segment, consisting of recording duration of 25 s as shown in Fig. 6. The proposed methodology was successful in the automatic detection of EOG artifacts in 23 out of 25 (92%) visually inspected (by visually correlating with the EOG electrode data) epochs contaminated by eye-blinks in the EEG recording for a single subject and detection rate was more than 88% (32 out of 36 cases) in visually inspected contaminated EEG data segments in the studies involving ten different subjects.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

We have proposed a new methodology for the elimination of the artifacts due to eye-blinks from the contaminated EEG segment. This methodology is able to eliminate the EOG artifacts from the measured EEG without using the reference electrode EOG data, while causing significantly lower distortion to the EEG data compared to the conventional wavelet based method. The significance of the present method lies in the fact that it enables automated detection and suppression of ocular artifacts after a proper selection of detection threshold.

The proposed methodology depends upon the proper detection of contaminated EEG segment. The use of different EEG recording equipments may influence the artifact detection. Hence some fine tuning of detection threshold parameters may be required to generalize the proposed method. We have also tested the proposed approach for elimination of cardiac artifacts but as some of the frequency components of cardiac and brain rhythms overlap, effective elimination of cardiac artifact is beyond the scope of this paper. It may be noted that there are no universal techniques available for efficient suppression of all kinds of artifacts using a single approach as emphasized by other research workers [33].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have presented a new approach for the identification and elimination of EOG artifacts by using the PCA with the EEMD from the EEG recordings, where the basis functions are derived using data itself. Comparison of the as recorded EEG with the cleaned EEG reveals an effective suppression of artifacts corresponding to eye blink without using an auxiliary reference eye-blink electrode. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be used for automatic detection and elimination of EOG artifacts after proper selection of threshold. Unlike PCA or ICA, the present method can be used for single channel EEG data, whereas PCA or ICA can be used only if the number of EEG channels is sufficiently large. The proposed method is capable of removing EOG artifacts while maintaining the non-contaminated EEG signal relatively undisturbed. It may be possible to extend these studies in future by investigating the feasibility of the proposed method for the elimination of the EOG artifacts in Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) studies, where separate sensors are not available to measure EOG artifacts.
