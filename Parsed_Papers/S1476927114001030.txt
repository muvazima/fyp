                  Background
                  Many structural centrality measures were proposed to predict putative disease genes on biological networks. Closeness is one of the best-known structural centrality measures, and its effectiveness for disease gene prediction on undirected biological networks has been frequently reported. However, it is not clear whether closeness is effective for disease gene prediction on directed biological networks such as signaling networks.
               
               
                  Results
                  In this paper, we first show that closeness does not significantly outperform other well-known centrality measures such as Degree, Betweenness, and PageRank for disease gene prediction on a human signaling network. In addition, we observed that prediction accuracy by the closeness measure was worse than that by a reachability measure, but closeness could efficiently predict disease genes among a set of genes with the same reachability value. Based on this observation, we devised a novel structural measure, hierarchical closeness, by combining reachability and closeness such that all genes are first ranked by the degree of reachability and then the tied genes are further ranked by closeness. We discovered that hierarchical closeness outperforms other structural centrality measures in disease gene prediction. We also found that the set of highly ranked genes in terms of hierarchical closeness is clearly different from that of hub genes with high connectivity. More interestingly, these findings were consistently reproduced in a random Boolean network model. Finally, we found that genes with relatively high hierarchical closeness are significantly likely to encode proteins in the extracellular matrix and receptor proteins in a human signaling network, supporting the fact that half of all modern medicinal drugs target receptor-encoding genes.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  Taken together, hierarchical closeness proposed in this study is a novel structural measure to efficiently predict putative disease genes in a directed signaling network.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Genes and their regulatory interactions form a large-scale cellular interaction network, and a multitude of studies have examined the structural characteristics of these networks for insight into the association between genes and diseases (Wu et al., 2008; Zhao and Li, 2010, 2012). For example, it was suggested that disease genes are often centrally distributed as hub nodes (i.e., nodes with high connectivity) on the network. Indeed, genes related to neurodegenerative disease (Panda et al., 2012), breast cancer (Chand and Alam, 2012), and hereditary disease (Xu and Li, 2006) were shown to have higher regulatory interactions than non-disease genes. In contrast, other studies reported that disease genes tend to be non-hubs (Barabasi et al., 2011; Goh et al., 2007). These conflicting results emphasize the necessity of investigating various other structural centrality measures. Closeness (Sabidussi, 1966), a structural centrality measure in which a node is defined as the inverse of the total sum of the shortest distance to all the other nodes in an undirected network, has been frequently used to predict the disease risk of genes on undirected biological networks with satisfactory performance (Erten et al., 2011; Gottlieb et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2008). The closeness definition can be also slightly modified to be properly used in a directed network (Opsahl et al., 2010). However, it may not be useful for disease gene prediction on a directed biological network because it does not fully employ direction-related information on the network. In particular, we note that the functional importance of a node can be proportional to the reachability of the node, i.e., the subset of connected nodes from it, on a directed network. This concern led us to investigate the effectiveness of closeness on a directed biological network.

In this study, we first observed that reachability is better than closeness in predicting putative disease genes on a signaling network, particularly for top-ranked genes. In addition, it was observed that a gene with higher closeness is more likely to a disease gene within a set of tied genes with the same reachability. Inspired by these observations, we proposed a novel structural measure, hierarchical closeness (HC), by combining reachability and closeness in such a way that the reachability first ranks all genes and then the closeness plays a role as a tie-breaking measure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HC, we compared HC and four other well-known structural centrality measures, including Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, and PageRank, with respect to disease gene prediction on a human signaling network and discovered that HC outperforms all the other measures, particularly for cancer, hereditary, immune, and neurodegenerative disease-related genes. Interestingly, we also found that the set of highly ranked genes in terms of HC is clearly different from the set of hub genes. It was also interesting that all of these findings are general properties conserved in random networks. Finally, we found that genes with high HC values are significantly likely to encode proteins in the extracellular matrix and receptor proteins in a human signaling network, explaining why half of all modern medicinal drugs target receptor-encoding genes.

In this work, we examine the topological distribution of genes in a human signaling network, which is a directed network, and a protein–protein interaction network, which is an undirected network. To this end, we selected 4350 disease genes extracted from OMIM database (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) in NCBI (Amberger et al., 2009, 2011) (see Table S1 in Supplementary Information) and mapped them into a human cellular signaling network composed of 1953 nodes and 8579 links obtained from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Kim et al., 2011) and a human protein–protein interaction network (HPPI) composed of 7535 nodes and 22,052 interactions (Goh et al., 2007). In particular, the KEGG signaling network published in (Kim et al., 2011) was constructed by integrating all the pathways of Homo sapiens (human) which can be represented by a directed graph: for example, pathways about metabolism, environmental information processing, cellular process, human disease, and so on. All the same identifiers of different pathways were merged into one node and redundant or neutral links were removed. In addition, an interaction from a gene/protein G to a group of genes/proteins {G
                        1, G
                        2,…, Gk
                        } in the original KEGG pathways was transformed into k different interactions G
                        →
                        G
                        1, G
                        →
                        G
                        2,…, and G
                        →
                        Gk
                         in the signaling network.

This measure has been successfully used to prioritize disease candidate genes in a protein–protein interaction network (Gottlieb et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2011). The definition of C
                        clo(v) is not proper, though, in cases where there is a node j that is not reachable from v because C
                        clo(v) eventually becomes zero. Thus, we used a variant definition of closeness (Opsahl et al., 2010) as follows:

                        (v) is the number of those paths that pass through v. The betweenness centrality was successfully used to investigate the relationship between structure and robustness in gene networks of glioma for renal cancer tissues (Sun et al., 2012). Proteins with high betweenness centrality in the pathway network were suggested as drug targets (Breitkreutz et al., 2012).

Although the original closeness measure partially denotes how centrally located a node is in a network, it does not explicitly include information about the range of other nodes that can be affected by the given node. In this regard, we propose hierarchical closeness of a node v, Chc
                        (v), by combining reachability and closeness measures as follows:

                        In other words, NR
                        (v) represents the number of nodes in V that can be reachable from v. It can also represent the hierarchical position of a node in a network (Jothi et al., 2009; Mones et al., 2012). We note that if NR
                        (v)=0, then Chc
                        (v)=0 because C
                        clo−
                           v
                        (v) is 0. In cases where NR
                        (v)>0, the reachability is a dominant factor because NR
                        (v)≥1 but C
                        clo−
                           v
                        (v)<1. In other words, the first term indicates the level of the global hierarchy and the second term presents the level of the local centrality. Fig. 1
                         illustrates the hierarchical closeness notion. As shown in that example, all nodes are first ranked by the reachability value, and the set of nodes with the same reachability are further ranked by the closeness. Based on this definition, genes with the highest HC values eventually represent a set of geometrically central genes in a directed network that can reach to most other genes by relatively short paths. In this study, we hypothesize that the higher the hierarchical closeness of a node is, the more functionally important the node is on the directed network.

To evaluate network robustness we employed a Boolean network model, which has been intensively used to investigate the dynamics of various biological networks (Kauffman, 1969, 1993; Maki-Marttunen et al., 2013; Samaga and Klamt, 2013; Stern, 1999). A network is represented by a simple directed graph G(V, A) where V
                        
                        =
                        {v
                        1
                        , v
                        2
                        , …, vn
                        } is a set of Boolean variables and A
                        
                        =
                        {(u, w)|u,} is a set of directed interactions. Then, a network state s(t)=(v
                        1(t), v
                        2(t), …, vn
                        (t)) at time t transits to the next state s(t
                        +1) according to a set of update rules F
                        ={f
                        1, f
                        2,…, fn
                        }; i.e., s(t
                        +1)=

                        +1 is 1 only if the values of v
                        1, v
                        2, and v
                        3 at time t are 1, 1, and 0, respectively. With these update rules, the generated Boolean network will operate in the ordered regime.

Similarly, we employed the fragility of a node v, γ(v), to represent the degree to which a node is not robust against the mutation subject to v as follows:

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Closeness is known to be an effective centrality measure for prioritizing the disease candidate genes in protein–protein interaction networks, which are undirected networks (Gottlieb et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2011). To verify this, we compared the predictive performance of closeness and other centrality measures including Degree, Betweenness, and PageRank, on the HPPI network (Fig. 2
                        A and Table S2 for details; see Section 2 for dataset). For a reliable performance comparison, we drew the receiver operating characteristic and computed the area under the curve (AUC). As shown in Fig. 2A, closeness significantly outperforms Degree (p
                        =0.042), Betweenness (p
                        =0.048), and PageRank (p
                        =0.026). However, the usefulness of closeness has not been sufficiently proven on a directed network, therefore we examined the performance of those four centrality measures on the KEGG signaling network (Fig. 2B and Table S3 for details; see Section 2 for dataset). As depicted in Fig. 2B, closeness shows the best performance but does not significantly outperform Betweenness, Degree, or PageRank (all p-values >0.60). We note that closeness does not fully reflect the reachability property of a node in a directed network as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, we hypothesize that the hierarchical closeness can be an effective alternative to improve the performance of closeness in a directed network.

As explained in Section 2.3, we expect that reachability is more useful than closeness overall in predicting disease genes and that closeness can be a tie-break measure for genes with the same reachability value. To explain the motivation for such a hypothesis, we investigated the prediction performance of reachability and closeness on the KEGG network. We computed the proportion of disease genes among the top-K genes ranked by the reachability or the closeness over the whole number of genes with K varying from 0% to 100% (Fig. 3
                        A). As shown in Fig. 3A, the proportions of disease genes for both reachability and closeness show negative correlations against K (≤60%). This means that genes with a higher reachability or closeness (K
                        ≤60%) tend to be disease genes. In addition, the reachability was significantly better than the closeness when K was approximately 10% (p
                        <0.05), whereas their accuracies were similar for larger top-ranking values. The reachability measure is not sufficient, however, because there can be many tied nodes with respect to the reachability value, as expected by the definition (see Fig. S1 for the frequency of reachability values in the KEGG network). Therefore, we considered the closeness as a tie-break measure. To validate this, we further compared the proportion of disease genes between high- and low-closeness groups defined by sets of genes whose closeness is larger and lower, respectively, than the average closeness over the tied genes with the same reachability (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3B, the proportion of disease genes of the high-closeness group is significantly higher than that of the low-closeness group (p
                        =0.0185). This implies that a gene with higher closeness is more likely to be a disease gene in each tied group, and thus closeness can be an efficient tie-break measure. To investigate whether this finding is an intrinsic principle in random networks, we generated 1000 random Boolean networks and examined the proportion of fragile nodes (see Section 2 for the definition) among the top-K nodes ranked by the reachability or the closeness with K varying from 0% to 100% (Fig. 3C). Similar to Fig. 3A, reachability outperformed closeness for some ranges of K (≤40%). We also examined the proportion of the fragile nodes, which are further ranked by the closeness for tied nodes (Fig. 3D). More specifically, three reachability values, 5, 25, and 44, with relatively high frequencies were chosen. In this Fig. 3D, all lines show a significantly negative relation against top closeness ranking (%) (all p-values <0.01). Taken together, the consistent results in random Boolean networks support the motivation to combine the reachability and the closeness to prioritize dynamically important nodes in a directed network.

As a result, the hierarchical closeness is proposed as a new centrality measure that combines reachability and closeness. To verify the efficiency of HC for disease gene prediction on a directed network, we evaluated the AUC value by HC prediction on the KEGG network (Fig. 4
                        A). As shown, HC outperforms other centrality measures including Degree, Reachability, Closeness, Betweenness, and PageRank (all p-values <0.05). In addition, we examined the performance of HC for fragile node prediction on random Boolean networks (Fig. 4B). After generating 1000 random Boolean networks, we examined the proportion of fragile nodes among the top-K nodes ranked by HC with K varying from 0% to 100%. As shown in Fig. 4B, HC shows the best performance compared with the other centrality measures in ranges of K
                        <70% (all p-values <0.0001). This implies that HC can be a generally useful measure to predict dynamically important nodes in a directed network.

Furthermore, we investigated the prediction performance of HC on four subgroups of specific disease genes such as cancer, hereditary, immune, and neurodegenerative disease subgroups (Fig. S2). We found that HC outperforms the other centrality measures significantly for the top 10% or 20% ranked genes (Fig. S2A–D). On the other hand, HC was not efficient to predict all the other types of disease genes (Fig. S2E). This implies that HC cannot predict all types of disease genes.

Many previous studies have shown that hub nodes are typically associated with disease genes (Panda et al., 2012). On the other hand, some studies indicate that disease genes tend to be non-hubs (Barabasi et al., 2011; Goh et al., 2007). In this regard, it is meaningful to compare the HC and hub centers. Therefore we investigated the degree distribution of node groups ranked by HC on the KEGG network (Fig. 5
                        ). More specifically, we classified all the genes into 10 subgroups of the same size according to HC ranking and examined the average degree and its standard deviation for each group. The lower the group number, the more central the node is with respect to the HC measure. It is interesting that the average degree of the third group, rather than the first group, is highest. This implies that the set of HC-center genes are different from the hub genes (with the largest interactions). We additionally examined the degree distribution on the random Boolean networks and observed a similar result. Taken together, the HC-centered but non-hub nodes can be considered dynamically important nodes on a directed network.

To investigate the biological characteristics of the HC-center genes in the KEGG network, we classified all the genes into two subgroups by HC values – ‘HC-high’ (586 genes) and ‘HC-low’ (1367 genes) – and examined the percentage of genes involved in each gene ontology (GO) term with respect to biological process, cellular component, and molecular function using FatiGO software (Al-Shahrour et al., 2004) (Table 1
                        ). The result shows that the HC-high genes are related to the extracellular matrix and cell surface receptor terms (membrane receptors, transmembrane receptors) (Table 1). Cell surface receptors are specialized integral membrane proteins that participate in communication between the cell and the outside world. Alteration or deficiency of genes encoding membrane receptors can disrupt signal transduction and ultimately cause diseases such as cancer (Muller-Pillasch et al., 1998) and Alzheimer’s (Scheuer et al., 1996). Proteins in the extracellular matrix are also considered as drug targets in pharmacotherapy (Huxley-Jones et al., 2008; Jarvelainen et al., 2009; Schaefer, 2010). Our finding suggests that cell surface receptor proteins are often associated with disease due to the topological characteristics of the genes encoding them, i.e., due to the central position of these genes in the signaling network. Although the HC-central genes are in optimal positions to reach most other genes, they are also the most fragile with respect to mutations.

Based on this observation, we also note that the membrane proteins can be an efficient indicator to identify disease genes because they act as signal sensors (Sanders and Myers, 2004; Sanders and Nagy, 2000). Through a further investigation, we found that 506 membrane genes (Group A) were included in the KEGG network by using Mouse Genome Informatics database (www.informatics.jax.org), and 207 genes among them were disease genes (i.e., the ratio is 0.409 (=207/506)) whereas there were 206 disease genes (i.e., the ratio is 0.407 (=206/506)) among the same number of genes having highest HC values (Group B). In addition, the number of genes in the intersection of Group A and B was 161 and there were 70 disease genes among them (i.e., the ratio is 0.435 (=70/161)). Taken together, membrane proteins are considerably efficient in disease gene prediction although all of them do not show the highest HC values.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Closeness is one of the best-known structural centrality measures, and its effectiveness for disease gene prediction has frequently been reported for undirected biological networks. In this study, we investigated whether closeness is equally effective on a directed network. We first showed that closeness does not significantly outperform other well-known centrality measures such as Degree, Betweenness, and PageRank for disease gene prediction on a human signaling network, which is a directed network, compared with an undirected network. In addition, we observed that the prediction accuracy by closeness measure was worse than that by reachability, but closeness could efficiently predict disease genes among a set of genes with the same reachability degree. Therefore, we proposed a novel measure, hierarchical closeness, in which we combine reachability and closeness such that all genes are first ranked by the degree of reachability and then the tied genes are further ranked by closeness. We found that hierarchical closeness outperforms other structural centrality measures in disease gene prediction, particularly for cancer, hereditary, immune, and neurodegenerative disease-related genes. Moreover, the set of highly ranked genes in terms of hierarchical closeness is clearly different from the set of hub genes with relatively high connectivity. It is also interesting that these findings are consistently observed in random Boolean networks. Finally, we found that genes with relatively high hierarchical closeness are significantly likely to encode proteins in the extracellular matrix and receptor proteins in a human signaling network, consistent with the fact that half of all modern medicinal drugs target receptor-encoding genes. These results suggest that HC-center genes should be seriously considered as putative dynamically important genes in a directed biological network.
