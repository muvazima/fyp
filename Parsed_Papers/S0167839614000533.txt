                  By means of bond theory, we study Stewart Gough (SG) platforms with n-dimensional self-motions with 
                        n
                        >
                        2
                     . It turns out that only architecturally singular manipulators can possess these self-motions. Based on this result, we present a complete list of all SG platforms, which have n-dimensional self-motions. Therefore this paper also solves the famous Borel Bricard problem for n-dimensional motions. We also give some remarks and a new result on SG platforms with 2-dimensional self-motions; nevertheless a full discussion of this case remains open.

                      of corresponding anchor points is connected by an SPS-leg, where only the prismatic joint (P) is active and the spherical joints (S) are passive.

If the geometry of the manipulator is given, as well as the lengths of the six pairwise distinct legs, the SG platform is generically rigid. But, under particular conditions, the manipulator can perform an n-dimensional motion (
                        n
                        >
                        0
                     ), which is called self-motion. If 
                        n
                        >
                        1
                      holds, the self-motion is a so-called multidimensional one.

Note that self-motions are also solutions to the still unsolved problem posed by the French Academy of Science for the Prix Vaillant of the year 1904, which is also known as Borel Bricard problem (cf. Borel, 1908; Bricard, 1906; Husty, 2000) and reads as follows: “Determine and study all displacements of a rigid body in which distinct points of the body move on spherical paths”.

It is already known that manipulators, which are singular in every possible configuration, possess self-motions in each pose (over 
                        C
                     ). These so-called architecturally singular SG platforms are well studied and classified (for the planar case we refer to Karger, 2003; Nawratil, 2008; Röschel and Mick, 1998; Wohlhart, 2010 and for the non-planar case see Karger, 2008; Nawratil, 2009). In contrast only a few self-motions of non-architecturally singular SG platforms are known. A detailed review of these self-motions was given in Nawratil (2012a), which is as complete as possible to the best knowledge of the author. Moreover until now only the following non-architecturally singular SG platform with a multidimensional self-motion is known to the author: The platform and the base are congruent. This so-called congruent SG platform has a 2-dimensional self-motion, if all legs have equal length. It can easily be seen that this self-motion is pure translational.


                     
                        Example 1
                        We consider a special congruent SG platform, which is also known as Wren platform (cf. Wohlhart, 1996). As in this case, the anchor points are located on two circles (see Fig. 1
                           a), the Wren platform is an architecturally singular manipulator (cf. Bricard, 1906; Chasles, 1861; Karger, 2002). If all legs have equal length, there also exists a 1-dimensional Schönlfies self-motion (see Fig. 1b), beside the already mentioned 2-dimensional translational self-motion (see Fig. 1c). In Fig. 1a, the branching singularity (cf. Gogu, 2009) of these two self-motions is displayed. Due to Wohlhart (1996), the manipulator is called kinematotropic, as it can change the dimension of mobility.

Beside the determination of additional examples of non-architecturally singular SG platforms with multidimensional self-motions, we also want to close the knowledge gap, whether non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 3-dimensional self-motions exist (cf. footnote 3 of Husty and Karger, 2002). This still open problem is answered within the article at hand, which is structured as follows:

In Section 2.1, we give a short introduction to the theory of bonds for SG platforms with self-motions. Depending on the dimension β of the bonding surface of the 3-dimensional self-motion after its projection from the Study parameter space into the Euler parameter space, we can distinguish four cases: 
                        β
                        =
                        −
                        1
                        ,
                        0
                        ,
                        1
                        ,
                        2
                      (cf. Section 2.2). In Section 3, we prove that non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 3-dimensional self-motions of type 
                        β
                        =
                        2
                      do not exist. In Section 4, we show that this is also the case for 
                        β
                        =
                        −
                        1
                        ,
                        0
                        ,
                        1
                     . Based on the obtained results, we give a complete list of all SG platforms, which have n-dimensional self-motions with 
                        n
                        >
                        2
                     , in Section 5. Finally, we close the paper with some remarks and a new result on SG platforms with 2-dimensional self-motions (cf. Section 6).

In Section 2.1, we give a short introduction to the theory of bonds for SG manipulators presented in Nawratil (2014), which was motivated by the bond theory of overconstrained closed linkages with revolute joints given by Hegedüs, Schicho and Schröcker (2012) (see also Hegedüs et al., 2013). We start with the direct kinematic problem of parallel manipulators of SG type and proceed with the definition of bonds. Based on these basics, we do some preparatory work in Section 2.2 by giving a classification of 3-dimensional self-motions, which is induced by the bond theory in a natural way.

Due to the result of Husty (1996), it is advantageous to work with Study parameters

We consider the algebraic motion of the mechanism, which is defined as the set of points on the Study quadric determined by the constraints; i.e. the common points of the seven quadrics

                        . If the manipulator has an n-dimensional self-motion then the algebraic motion also has to be of this dimension. Now the points of the algebraic motion with 
                           N
                           ≠

                         equal the kinematic image of the algebraic variety V. But we can also consider the points of the algebraic motion, which belong to the exceptional cone 
                           N
                           =

The restriction to non-translational motions is caused by the following approach used for the computation of bonds: In a first step we project the algebraic motion of the mechanism into the Euler parameter space

                         by the elimination of

                        . In a second step we determine those points of the projected point set, which are located on the quadric 
                           N
                           =

Clearly, the kernel of this projection equals the group of translational motions. As a consequence a component of V, which corresponds to a pure translational motion, is projected to a single point

                         (with

                        . Therefore the intersection of 
                           O
                         and 
                           N
                           =
                           0
                         equals ∅, which reasons the exclusion of pure translational motions within this approach.

Moreover it is important to note that the set of bonds depends on the geometry of the manipulator, and not on the leg lengths (cf. Theorem 1 of Nawratil, 2014).

Due to Theorem 2 of Nawratil (2014) an SG platform possesses a pure translational self-motion, if and only if the platform can be rotated about the center

                        . If all these five vectors are zero-vectors, which corresponds with the case that the platform and the base are congruent, then we get the already mentioned 2-dimensional translational self-motion.


                        
                           Remark 1
                           As these translatoric self-motions have spherical trajectories there exists no 3-dimensional translatoric self-motion of an SG platform.

We assume that a given SG manipulator has a 3-dimensional self-motion 
                           S
                        . As 
                           S
                         corresponds with a 3-dimensional solution of the direct kinematics problem, the corresponding algebraic motion is also 3-dimensional. Due to the fact that this algebraic motion is the kinematic image of a self-motion, it cannot be located within the exceptional cone

                         (hypersurface). Therefore the bond-set of this self-motion has to be an algebraic variety of dimension 2; i.e. a bonding surface.

Now we want to classify 
                           S
                         with respect to the dimension β of the bonding surface after its projection into the Euler parameter space 
                           
                              
                                 P
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                        . As we have a bonding surface in the Study parameter space 
                           
                              
                                 P

                        , β can take the values 
                           −
                           1

                           2
                        , where the case 
                           β
                           =
                           2
                         is the general one. In order that

                           1
                        , there has to exist a 
                           (
                           2
                           −
                           i
                           )
                        -dimensional translational sub-self-motion, which is contained in 
                           S
                        , in each pose of 
                           S
                         according to Definition 1. For 
                           i
                           =
                           −
                           1
                         this already implies that 
                           S
                         is a 3-dimensional translation.

To make things clearer, we give the following example:


                        
                           Example 2
                           We study a congruent SG platform where the anchor points are located on two parallel lines. As this is also a conic section, the manipulator is again architecturally singular. If all legs have equal lengths, this manipulator has two 2-dimensional self-motions, where the first one (parallelogram mode) is the already known translation (cf. Fig. 2
                              a). Therefore this self-motion is of type 
                                 β
                                 =
                                 −
                                 1
                              .

The second 2-dimensional self-motion (anti-parallelogram mode) has a 1-dimensional translational sub-self-motion (circular translation) in each pose of its self-motion (cf. Fig. 2b).

For this manipulator, we can compute the bond-set according to Nawratil (2014). The two parallel lines of the base are given by the x-axis of the fixed frame and an x-parallel line through the point

                                       )

                              . Therefore the base anchor points have coordinates

Moreover it should be noted that this manipulator does not change the dimension of mobility but the type of mobility (cf. Fanghella et al., 2006) according to the above given classification of self-motions.

                                 Note that the Wren platform also changes the type of mobility with respect to this classification in its branching singularity, as the Schönlfies self-motion is of type 
                                       β
                                       =

                                     (cf. Example 1 of Nawratil, 2014).
                               The flattened position of the manipulator illustrated in Fig. 2c is a bifurcation configuration between the parallelogram mode (
                                 β
                                 =
                                 −
                                 1
                              ) and the anti-parallelogram mode (
                                 β
                                 =
                                 0
                              ).

A necessary condition for a non-architecturally singular SG platform with a 3-dimensional self-motion is that the 4-legged manipulator resulting from the removal of two legs, which fulfill certain conditions in order to enable the 3-dimensional self-motion, has also a 3-dimensional self-motion.
                        3
                     
                     
                        3
                        If there is only one leg, which fulfills a certain constraint, then its removal would imply that any arbitrary 5-legged manipulator has two degrees of freedom, which yields a contradiction to the formula of Grübler.
                     
                  

Without loss of generality (w.l.o.g.) we can assume that the removed legs are those with index 5 and 6, respectively. Then the solution of the direct kinematics over 
                        C
                      of this 4-legged manipulator can be written as the algebraic variety

                           . Therefore the 4-legged manipulator has a 3-dimensional self-motion in each pose. By attaching again two arbitrary legs it follows that the resulting SG platform has a 1-dimensional self-motion in each pose and therefore it is singular in each pose (⇒ architecturally singular SG platform). Hence the 4-legged manipulator has to be a degenerated manipulator (cf. Karger, 1998), which can only be one of the following cases

                              The proof of the sufficiency can easily be done by direct computations as follows. For both designs I and II we compute Γ, where N can be factored out. The remaining polynomial is denoted by ϒ. Therefore the conditions are sufficient for the factorization. Moreover we have to show that the designs are also sufficient for the existence of a 3-dimensional self-motion. This is the case, if there exist leg lengths

                              It should be noted that every SG manipulator, which possesses one of the 4-legged manipulators of Lemma 2 as subassembly, already has at least a 1-dimensional spherical self-motion.

In the following three lemmata the remaining special cases are treated. For their proofs we refer to the corresponding technical report (Nawratil, 2013a) of this article, as they can be done in a fashion similar to the general case.

                           Proof
                           The proof of this theorem is based on the results obtained in Lemmas 1–5. Now we have to add two further legs (legs 5 and 6) to the only non-degenerated 4-legged manipulators with a 3-dimensional self-motion (design I and II of Lemma 2) without restricting the dimension of this self-motion. A necessary condition for this is that every 4-legged manipulator of the resulting SG platform equals design I or II, respectively.

As a consequence, we can only attach the fifth and sixth leg to design I under the side condition

Analogous considerations for design II show that we can only attach the fifth and sixth leg if

                               hold with distinct

We start this section by studying 3-dimensional self-motions of type

                     :

                              −
                              1
                            
                           do not exist.
                        


                     
                        Proof
                        According to Remark 1 3-dimensional self-motions of type 
                              β
                              =
                              −
                              1
                            cannot exist. But this can also easily be seen as follows: We assume that an SG manipulator configuration exists, where the manipulator can perform a 3-dimensional self-motion of type 
                              β
                              =
                              −
                              1
                           . Therefore the manipulator can be moved out of this configuration by any translation of arbitrary direction. By choosing e.g. the direction of the P-joint of the i-th leg, we see that the corresponding sphere condition 
                              
                                 
                                    Λ
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                            is violated, which already yields the contradiction.  □

                              β
                              =
                              0
                            is that there exists a 1-parametric set of platform orientations with

                            for 
                              i
                              =
                              1

                              3
                           . Clearly, this can only be the case if all three anchor points are located on a line. Therefore this condition implies a congruent SG platform, where all anchor points are collinear. This is a trivial architecturally singular manipulator (cf. item 1 of Theorem 3 of Karger, 2008), which finishes the proof of Theorem 4.  □

The answer to the question asked in footnote 3 of Husty and Karger (2002), whether non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 3-dimensional self-motions exist, is included within the next theorem.


                     
                        Theorem 5
                        
                           Non-architecturally singular SG platforms, which possess an n-dimensional self-motion with 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              3
                              ,
                              4
                           
                           , do not exist. SG platforms (architecturally singular or not) with higher-dimensional self-motions than 4 do not exist.
                        


                     
                        Proof
                        Due to Theorems 1–4, this is true for 
                              n
                              =
                              3
                           . Therefore we focus on the case 
                              n
                              =
                              4
                           , for which Theorem 5 is proven by contradiction. If we replace a leg of the non-architecturally singular SG platform, which fulfills a condition in order to enable the 4-dimensional self-motion, by an arbitrary leg (not causing an architecturally singular design), we end up with a non-architecturally singular manipulator with a 3-dimensional self-motion; a contradiction.

Therefore we only remain with the proof of the last sentence of Theorem 5. If we couple the platform and the base only by one leg with non-zero length, the motion is a 5-dimensional one.
                              5
                           
                           
                              5
                              A leg with zero length already restricts the mobility to three dimensions.
                            A second leg with non-zero length, which differs from the first one, already restricts the motion to a 4-dimensional one, which finishes the proof.  □

Due to this theorem, only architecturally singular manipulators can have n-dimensional self-motions with 
                        n
                        =
                        3
                        ,
                        4
                     . As preparatory work for a complete list of these manipulators, which is given in Theorems 6 and 7, we will prove the following lemma:


                     
                        Lemma 6
                        
                           A 4-legged manipulator can only have a 4-dimensional self-motion, if it is the following degenerated one (under consideration of footnote 4): All base anchor points are collinear and the four platform anchor points collapse into one point.
                        


                     
                        Proof
                        We assume that there exists a 4-legged manipulator with a 4-dimensional self-motion. If we replace one of the four legs, which fulfills a certain constraint in order to enable the 4-dimensional self-motion, by an arbitrary leg, we end up with a 4-legged manipulator with a 3-dimensional self-motion, where one leg is free of any constraints. Therefore it can only be either design I of Lemma 2 or item (a) of Section 3.1.1. As the latter is a special case of design I we can restrict ourselves to this case.

Now the question arises, how design I can be specified to obtain even a 4-dimensional self-motion. In order to find an answer, we first consider the 3-legged manipulator with

                            are collinear. This 4-dimensional self-motion is not restricted by the attachment of a fourth leg, if and only if the fourth leg belongs to the pencil of lines spanned by the first three legs. This results in the conditions given in Lemma 6.  □

Based on this lemma we can prove the following theorem:


                     
                        Theorem 6
                        
                           If an SG platform has a 4-dimensional self-motion, it has to be the following architecturally singular design (under consideration of footnote 4): All base anchor points are collinear and the six platform anchor points collapse into one point (cf.

                        Proof
                        As each 4-legged manipulator of the SG platform has to have a 4-dimensional self-motion, the result is implied by Lemma 6.  □

                           . Design 4 is highly redundant as the six legs belong to a regulus of lines and therefore one can remove any three legs without changing the direct kinematics and singularity surface (cf. page 222 of Koenigs, 1897). As a consequence the manipulator has trivially a 3-dimensional self-motion.

Therefore these conditions are sufficient for the existence of 3-dimensional self-motions. In the following we show that they are necessary as well. To do so we distinguish the following cases with respect to the rank of the manipulator's Jacobian

If we have an architecturally singular manipulator with 
                              r
                              k

                           , it has to contain a non-degenerated 4-legged manipulator with a 3-dimensional self-motion. Due to our results obtained in the proofs given in Sections 3 and 4, there only exist the two designs I and II of Lemma 2 with this property.

Therefore we have to add two further legs (legs 5 and 6) to these two designs without restricting the 3-dimensional self-motion. A necessary condition for this is that every 4-legged manipulator of the resulting SG platform is either a degenerated one (items (a)–(c) of Section 3.1.1) or equals design I and II, respectively.

                                    , it is not difficult to figure out that we get the two cases given in items 1 and 2 of Theorem 7.


                     
                        Remark 3
                        In the author's opinion, the following interesting property of the design, given in item 4 of Theorem 7, should be noted: In the general case the 3-dimensional self-motion is of type 
                              β
                              =
                              2
                           . If κ is a similarity (cf. proof of Theorem 3), we get a type 
                              β
                              =
                              1
                            self-motion. Moreover if κ is the congruence and all legs have equal length, we even get a 3-dimensional self-motion of type 
                              β
                              =
                              0
                            (cf. proof of Theorem 4). Finally it should be mentioned that the manipulator design with the 4-dimensional self-motion, which is always of type 
                              β
                              =
                              2
                           , can also be obtained from item 4 of Theorem 7 by assuming that κ is singular.

Within this article we gave a complete list of all SG platforms, which have n-dimensional self-motions with 
                        n
                        >
                        2
                      (cf. Theorems 6 and 7). All these manipulators are architecturally singular (cf. Theorem 5).

Therefore only the study of SG platforms with 2-dimensional self-motions remains open within the field of multidimensional self-motions. Based on Theorem 3 of Karger (2008), it is not difficult to give a list of all architecturally singular manipulators with 
                        r
                        k
                        (
                        J
                        )
                        =
                        4
                     . This is left to the reader. The more challenging problem, which is still unsolved, is the determination of all architecturally singular designs with 
                        r
                        k
                        (
                        J
                        )
                        =
                        5
                      possessing 2-dimensional self-motions. This list is of interest as from each entry non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 1-dimensional self-motions can be constructed in the same way as done for SG manipulators with so-called type II DM self-motions (cf. Nawratil, 2013b). This topic is dedicated to future research.

Finally, we want to give a new result on non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 2-dimensional self-motions. Beside the pure translational self-motion (⇒ type 
                        β
                        =
                        −
                        1
                     ) of the congruent SG platform, there exists a further trivial example, which was not mentioned before in the literature, to the best knowledge of the author. This design, implied by the results obtained in Section 3, can be given as follows (under consideration of footnote 4): For

                      coincides with

                     . This self-motion is a pure spherical one (⇒ type 
                        β

It remains open, whether further non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 2-dimensional self-motions exist (especially a design with a type 
                        β
                        =
                        0
                      self-motion) beside the two already known ones. This topic is dedicated to future research as well.

                                          . A comparison of this condition with the one of item 2a shows that they are identical if the indices 3 and 4 are exchanged. Therefore this case yields the analogous results with respect to this exchange of indices.

                                       SG manipulator is planar: In this case the platform and the base are congruent. It is well known (cf. Karger, 2002; Nawratil, 2012b) that this class of manipulators can only have non-translational self-motions, if they are architecturally singular. This already closes the planar case.

SG manipulator is non-planar: In this case we have to distinguish between two possibilities:
                                             
                                                (i)
                                                Platform and base are directly congruent: For this class of manipulators it is known (cf. Nawratil, in press) that they cannot have 1-dimensional translational self-motions, but only 2-dimensional ones (if all legs have equal length). Therefore this case can only result in 4-dimensional self-motions of type

In the following we show by means of computation that a reflection-congruent SG manipulator cannot have a self-motion of type

Moreover we can choose special coordinate systems in the platform and the base in a way that we get:

                                                   , as otherwise we only get at most a 2-dimensional self-motion of type

                                           are collinear and the corresponding points are related by a similarity transformation. If we extend this solution to all six pairs of anchor points, we get a trivial architecturally singularity, as all anchor points are located on a line (cf. item 1 of Theorem 3 of Karger (2008)).

It remains to check whether T can be fulfilled identically. It can easily be seen that this happens if and only if
