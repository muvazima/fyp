                  This paper deals with the problem of global asymptotic stability of fixed-point state-space digital filters under various combinations of quantization and overflow nonlinearities and for the situation where quantization occurs after summation only. Utilizing the structural properties of the nonlinearities in greater detail, a new global asymptotic stability criterion is proposed. A unique feature of the presented approach is that it exploits the information about the maximum normalized quantization error of the quantizer and the maximum representable number for a given wordlength. The approach leads to an enhanced stability region in the parameter-space, as compared to several previously reported criteria.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Due to a broad range of applications of digital filters in many areas such as telecommunications, speech processing, image processing, medical electronics, geophysics, control systems, spectrum and vibration analyses, adaptive and tracking systems, etc., the design and analysis of various types of filters have received considerable attention [1–10] over the past few decades.

In the implementation of a stable and linear recursive digital filter using finite wordlength processors with fixed-point arithmetic, nonlinearities are introduced owing to the quantization and overflow [11,12]. Quantization nonlinearities in digital filters usually take one of the following three forms: magnitude truncation, round off and value truncation. The usual types of overflow nonlinearities employed in practice are zeroing, triangular, two's complement and saturation overflow characteristics. Due to the presence of such nonlinearities, the filter may exhibit unstable behavior (e.g., granular limit cycles, overflow oscillations etc.). When dealing with the design and implementation of fixed-point state-space digital filters, it is essential to have a criterion for choosing the values of the filter coefficients so that the designed filter is free of limit cycles. If the digital filter is implemented on a digital hardware with sufficiently long wordlength, the effects of quantization and overflow may be treated as decoupled or mutually independent [11,12]. Under this decoupling approximation, a number of researchers have studied quantization effects in digital filters without considering overflow effects [13–18], while others have investigated overflow effects in the absence of quantization [19–32]. On the other hand, several researchers have also queried the validity of decoupling approximation [33,34].

The study of the stability properties of digital filters under the combined effects of quantization and overflow nonlinearities appears to be more realistic due to the fact that the operations of practical digital filters take place in presence of both types of nonlinearities [35–41]. The problem of global asymptotic stability of fixed-point state-space digital filters with combinations of quantization and overflow has attracted the attention of a few researchers [35–41]. A few computationally simple criteria have been reported in [38] under which the global asymptotic stability of a system involving quantization and overflow nonlinearities is shown to be equivalent to the global asymptotic stability of that with only quantization nonlinearities. The key idea of [38] is based on the determination of stability regions where overflow cannot occur. In practice, the results in [38] are helpful to determine the stability of digital filters with combinations of quantization and overflow nonlinearities using available stability information for digital filters with only quantization nonlinearities. Ref. [40] presents improved versions of some of the stability results given in [38]. An alternative approach for stability analysis of digital filters with various combinations of quantization (except value truncation) and overflow nonlinearities has also been established in [40]. The state-space criterion in [40] is based on the sector information of the combined quantization and overflow nonlinearities where overflow nonlinearities are assumed for every state in the system. However, when dealing with the dynamic behavior of digital filters in presence of finite wordlength nonlinearities, it is worth noticing that all the states in the system may not reach to the overflow level. Depending on the values of system parameters, [41] makes distinction between the nonlinearities operating as composite nonlinearities and those operating as only quantization nonlinearities. The criterion in [41] has been derived using a more precise characterization of the nonlinearities as compared to [40] and, therefore, [41] turns out to be an improvement over [40]. It may be observed that [41] utilizes only the values of system parameters in order to identify the nonlinearities operating in the quantization region but ignores the information about the maximum normalized quantization error of the quantizer and the maximum representable number for a given wordlength. Consequently, there still remains scope for characterizing the composite nonlinearities properly with a view to achieve enhanced stability region in the parameter-space.

Motivated by the preceding discussion, in this paper, we revisit the problem of global asymptotic stability of fixed-point state-space digital filters under the influence of various combinations of quantization and overflow. Larger the global asymptotic stability region in the parameter-space of a digital filter, greater would be the flexibility to choose the filter coefficients. It remains a challenge to reduce the conservatism of the existing criteria for testing the stability of digital filters, particularly in the presence of both quantization and overflow. Therefore, we aim to develop an approach which may lead to less conservative stability conditions than those in [38,40,41]. Inspired by the works of [30,31], an improved method for extracting the composite nonlinearities which effectively operate only in quantization region is developed. This method not only captures the information of the dynamical behavior of the system more efficiently as compared to [41] but also makes use of the information about the maximum normalized quantization error of the quantizer and the maximum representable number for a given wordlength. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the notations used in this paper and introduces the system under consideration along with the existing criteria. A new sufficient condition for the nonexistence of limit cycles in fixed-point state-space digital filters under various combinations of quantization and overflow is established in Section 3. In Section 4, a comparison of the proposed criterion with previously reported criteria [38,40,41] is made in order to establish the significance of the present approach. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 5.

Eqs. (1)–(3) represent a class of digital filters with different combinations of quantization and overflow nonlinearities where quantization occurs after summation only. The problem is to choose the multipliers

For this, some existing criteria [40,41], which ensure the global asymptotic stability (thereby, imply the absence of any kind of instability including limit cycles), may be utilized. Pertaining to the system described by (1) and (2), the following result is reported in [41].

                        Remark 1
                        
                           Theorem 1 is based on the assumption that the elements of 
                              A
                            satisfy (7). Such assumption does not pose any real difficulty because of the fact that any system given by (1) and (2) can always be transformed into an equivalent system satisfying (7) by relabeling the states of the original system. The approach in [41] makes use of the parameters

                        Remark 2
                        As illustrated in [41], Theorem 1 may uncover some new 
                              A
                            (i.e., not covered by [40, Theorem 1]) for which system (1) and (2) is globally asymptotically stable.

                           . However, as shown in [40,41] such cases may fall within the application scope of Theorem 1 and [40, Theorem 1].

In this section, a new criterion for the global asymptotic stability of the system described by (1) and (2) is established.

In the light of (4), system (1) can be represented as

                      System (9) can be interpreted as a nonlinear system driven by a bounded error signal

With a view to achieve an asymptotic bound on system (9), we now introduce a new nonlinear nonnegative system given by

It is clear from Lemma 1 that the asymptotic response of the system in (9) (which is an equivalent representation of system (1)) is bounded by the asymptotic response of system (10). In the following, by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the system (10), we establish an iterative algorithm for determining the composite nonlinearities of system (1) which will act only in quantization region.

In particular, the algorithm generates a set of coordinate indexes

                        Remark 7
                        It may be mentioned that an algorithm analogous to Algorithm 1 is presented in [30] in the context of the stability analysis of digital filters with saturation arithmetic. Algorithm 1 may be treated as an extension of [30] from the case of discrete-time systems with saturation arithmetic to a class of systems operating under various combinations of quantization and overflow nonlinearities.


                     
                        Remark 8
                        
                           Theorem 2 makes use of the sector information of the composite nonlinearities in a precise manner and, therefore, it is not applicable for the digital filters with value truncation quantization. The value truncation quantization, owing to its peculiar characteristic, cannot be characterized using sector concept [18,38,40].


                     
                        Remark 9
                        Note that, in the development of Algorithm 1 and in the proof of Theorem 2, nowhere it is required to impose the restriction similar to (7). Theorem 2 (in conjunction with Algorithm 1) can be directly used to test the global asymptotic stability of a digital filter with known δ and 
                              
                                 
                                    N
                                 
                                 
                                    max
                                 
                              
                           . The condition expressed by (19b) is a linear matrix inequality (LMI) and, thus, is computationally tractable [42,43]. The matrix 
                              C
                            given by (19a) is dependent on 
                              
                                 
                                    J
                                 
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                              
                            which can be obtained via Algorithm 1. Though the condition (19b) is apparently free of parameters δ and

                                    max
                                 
                              
                           , these parameters have been utilized in Algorithm 1 to obtain 
                              
                                 
                                    J
                                 
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                              
                           . Using Theorem 2, one can easily identify the combination(s) of overflow and quantization that would be required to guarantee the absence of zero-input limit cycles in a digital filter. Theorem 2 is less conservative than existing ones [38,40,41], and this fact will be illustrated in Section 4. It will also be demonstrated how Theorem 2 can be used to determine the minimum wordlength (if exists) for assuring the absence of limit cycles in a digital filter (see Example 2).

It is worth comparing the main result of this paper (Theorem 2) with previously reported results [40,41]. Theorem 1 in [40] is based on exploiting the fact that all composite nonlinearities are confined to the sector

                        ,

                        ]
                     . On the other hand, depending on the values of system parameters (see (7)), the approach in [41] identifies that the composite nonlinearities

As discussed in [41], (30) turns out to be a more precise characterization of composite nonlinearities than the characterization used in the derivation of [40, Theorem 1]. It may be noticed that, unlike [40, Theorem 1], the result in [41] is based on assumption (7). However, as noted in Remark 1, such assumption does not pose any real difficulty in applications.

With a view to provide a clear link between Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, let us now examine the presented approach carefully. Theorem 2 is based on a unique characterization of composite nonlinearities, namely, 
                        β
                        ⩾
                        0
                      (see (23)). Observe that, the set 
                        
                           
                              J
                           
                           
                              F
                           
                        
                      involved in the expression of β (see (23)) is obtained via an iterative algorithm (Algorithm 1). A unique feature of Algorithm 1 is that it exploits the information of the maximum normalized quantization error (δ) and the maximum representable number (
                        
                           
                              N
                           
                           
                              max
                           
                        
                     ). This feature is seemingly missing in the approaches of [40,41]. From Remark 5, it follows that the composite nonlinearities 
                        
                           
                              f
                           
                           
                              i

                        (
                        r
                        )
                        )
                     , 
                        ∀
                        i
                        ∈

                      involved in system (1), will operate only in the quantization region. An examination of Algorithm 1 reveals that, as compared to the approach in [41], the present approach, in general, is capable of capturing a larger subset of composite nonlinearities that effectively operate as only quantization nonlinearities. In other words, the nonnegativity of β (see (23)) turns out to be a more precise characterization of the composite nonlinearities as compared to (30). This qualitatively explains why the present approach may lead to a less stringent stability condition than the previous approaches [40,41].

Pertaining to system (1), we now identify the following two cases where the present approach yields same stability region as obtainable via [40, Theorem 1], [41].


                     
                        Case 1
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    K
                                 
                                 
                                    o
                                 
                              
                              =
                              0
                           .

It is easy to observe that Theorem 2 becomes identical to Theorem 1 in this case. Further, as noted in [41], Theorem 1 reduces to [40, Theorem 1] for 
                        
                           
                              K
                           
                           
                              o
                           
                        
                        =
                        0
                     .


                     
                        Case 2

                                    a

                              |
                              >
                              1
                              ,
                              
                              i
                              =
                              1
                              ,
                              2
                              ,
                              …

                              n
                           .

In this case, as shown in [41], Theorem 1 reduces to [40, Theorem 1]. Further, Algorithm 1 in the present approach provides 
                        
                           
                              J
                           
                           
                              F
                           
                        
                        =
                        ϕ
                     , and consequently, 
                        C
                      in Theorem 2 is identified as 
                        
                           
                              I
                           
                           
                              n
                           
                        
                     . Thus, Theorem 2 also reduces to [40, Theorem 1] in the light of Remark 6.

Except the above two cases, Theorem 2 may lead to results not covered by [40, Theorem 1], [41]. Two examples illustrating the improvement realized from the present approach are in order.

                            satisfying (8). Thus, Theorem 1 fails as a global asymptotic stability test in this example. It can also be verified that [40, Theorem 1] fails to determine the global asymptotic stability for the present system.

Observe that

                            given by (31). Therefore, in view of Remark 3, the present example falls outside the application scope of [38, Theorems 1 and 3] and [40, Theorem 3].

Assuming that the present system is to be implemented on a 16-bit digital processor, we now apply Theorem 2 to test the global asymptotic stability. Taking

                           . Therefore, [38, Theorems 1 and 3] and [40, Theorem 3] cannot be applied to ascertain the global asymptotic stability of this system (see Remark 3). Using the Matlab LMI toolbox [42,43], it is easy to verify that Theorem 1 and [40, Theorem 1] fail to affirm the global asymptotic stability in the present example.

Now, we consider the following two cases to illustrate the effect of finite wordlength on the stability behavior of the system under consideration using the presented approach.

                      Thus, according to Theorem 2, the 16-bit realization of the present digital filter is globally asymptotically stable.

In the above, we observe that Theorem 2 fails to assure the global asymptotic stability for 8-bit realization of the present system but succeeds to conclude the same for an increased wordlength (i.e., 16-bit realization). On the other hand, in the previous approaches [40,41], there is no way to know whether a given system may become globally asymptotically stable for an increased wordlength. The dependency of

                      on the stability of a given system (1) and δ makes the present approach quite interesting. Such dependence of δ and 
                        
                           
                              N

                      on the stability results in [40, Theorem 1], [41] is apparently missing.

Next, we aim to determine the minimum wordlength that would be required to guarantee the absence of limit cycles using Theorem 2 for the example under consideration.

Let the minimum wordlength required for the limit cycle-free realization of the present digital filter be 
                        (
                        l

                      given by (42), it can be verified that (19b) is feasible for the present example. In other words, according to the present approach, the global asymptotic stability is guaranteed in this example if it is implemented on a processor having at least (

                        +
                        1
                     ) bits wordlength.

Summarizing the above, the presented approach has a distinct advantage over the previous approaches [38,40,41] in that Theorem 2 can yield stability conditions which are outside the scope of [38,40,41]. In other words, in the design of digital filters employing quantization and overflow nonlinearities, Theorem 2 could help to obtain a larger stability region than that obtainable via the criteria in [38,40,41], which is important since, for efficient design, it is required to have as large stability region as possible. It is also shown how Theorem 2 can be used to determine the minimum wordlength (if exists) for guaranteeing the absence of limit cycles in a digital filter.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A new criterion (Theorem 2) for the global asymptotic stability of fixed-point state-space digital filters under various combinations of quantization and overflow nonlinearities has been established. The strategy adopted in this paper is to exploit the parameters δ and 
                        
                           
                              N
                           
                           
                              max
                           
                        
                      (i.e., in addition to system parameters) for identifying the nonlinearities operating in the quantization region. This feature is seemingly missing in the previous approaches [40, Theorem 1], [41]. As demonstrated by examples, Theorem 2 provides less restrictive stability condition than several existing criteria [38,40,41]. The effect of wordlength of the digital hardware on the stability behavior of the digital filter has been illustrated in Example 2.

The problem of realizing a given digital filter transfer function into a state-space form so as to minimize certain objective functions such as roundoff noise gain, computational complexity, sensitivity to coefficient quantization, etc. has been of considerable interest [5–10]. It is desirable to ensure the nonexistence of limit cycles in such state-space realizations. Since the presented approach generally provides a larger stability region in the parameter-space as compared to [38,40,41] the designer would have greater flexibility to exploit the results of [5–10]. If Theorem 2 instead of [38,40,41] is used, it would be possible to further minimize the said objective functions (namely, roundoff noise gain, computational complexity, sensitivity to coefficient quantization, etc.) while achieving limit cycle-free filter structure.
