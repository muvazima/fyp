                  Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has received increasing attention for its simple principle, low computational cost and excellent performance. However, a large number of labeled instances are often required, and the number of hidden nodes should be manually tuned, for better learning and generalization of ELM. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Semi-Supervised Extreme Learning Machine (S3ELM) via joint sparse regularization for classification, which can automatically prune the model structure via joint sparse regularization technology, to achieve more accurate, efficient and robust classification, when only a small number of labeled training samples are available.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) [18,19] is a special type of Single-hidden Layer Feedforward Neural network (SLFN) that has received increasing interests in the machine learning community. Compared to traditional SLFNs, ELM randomly generates the connected weights between input nodes and hidden nodes. Therefore, only the linearly connected weights in the output layer should be tuned in ELM, which makes the learning of ELM simple and efficient. A large number of numerical experiments show that ELM can obtain similar performance to (even better performance than) SVM in both classification and regression tasks [8].

Nowadays ELM has been extensively studied in theory and application. For example, the universal approximation theorem of ELM is researched in [15,13,14]; [17,4,26] focus on the enhancing robustness and generalization of ELM. Kernel based ELM is developed in [17,9] by defining the inner product of hidden layer output vectors of two samples as a kernel function. Ensemble ELM is studies by [21,11,27,35], and [25,36] extended ELM to semi-supervised learning. In [21,24,23] the authors proposed some online sequential ELM algorithms for ELM. Additionally, ELM has found many successful applications in various engineering fields, including the classification in P2P networks [35], indoor location estimation based on Wi-Fi [25], sales forecasting [34], protein sequence classification [37], and human action recognition [28].

According to learning theory [2], model selection is an important issue because too simple and too complex models will result in degraded generalization. Although ELM is characteristic of simple principle, low computational cost and excellent performance, in practical applications the number of hidden nodes should be manually tuned for better learning and generalization capability. Some researchers have taken efforts on the constructive model selection of ELM automatically [16], which can be split into three categories:
                        
                           (1)
                           Nodes Growing Method (NGM). For NGM, model selection is realized by increasing the random hidden nodes step by step [15,13,7,22]. In [15], when a new hidden node is added into ELM network, all the existed weight connecting coefficients remain unchanged. The weight connecting coefficient of the added node is obtained by minimizing the approximation error and the algorithm stops when training error is less than a threshold. Similar with [15,13] also increases the random hidden nodes step by step. The difference between them is that [13] calculates the weight connecting coefficient of the added node by minimizing the approximation error in a special line segment. The characteristic in [13] is that the obtained weight connecting coefficients are also updated when calculating the weight connecting coefficient of the added node. In [14], multiple hidden nodes are generated randomly and the best hidden node among them is added into ELM network. Therefore, this method can obtain the better approximate performance for the same scale of the network. The method in [7] adds the multiple hidden nodes at the same time, and updates the weight connecting coefficients by using generalized inverse which makes ELM a stronger approximation performance. Meanwhile, this method becomes an online learning method by efficient matrix operations. The method in [22] is similar to [14], which generates the multiple hidden nodes as the set of the candidate nodes. When the ELM network is updated, the node in the candidate set which has maximum correlation with the current residual is selected and added the network. Then the weight connecting coefficients are optimized. Similarly, when training error is less than a threshold, this algorithm stops.

Nodes Pruning Method (NPM). NPMs generate the sufficiently large ELM network randomly, and then adjust the structure by pruning strategies [26,32,29]. In [32], Chi-squared (
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          χ
                                       
                                       
                                          2
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              ) method and information gain criterion are used to measure the degree of relevance between the hidden nodes and the class labels. Meanwhile, threshold method is used for pruning the less relevant hidden nodes. In [29], hidden nodes are sorted by Multi-Response Sparse Regression (MRSR) method. Then the least relevant hidden node is deleted one by one. The algorithm will not stop until the classification/regression accuracy reduces which is measured by leave-one-out (LOO) criterion. However, the method in [29] often encounters potential numerical risks. To fix this problem, Tikhonov regularization is applied by the pruning algorithm in [26], which has improved stability greatly.

Hybrid Method (HM). HMs combine the above two strategies [20]. In [20], multiple hidden nodes are randomly generated at first by the same method in [14]. Then the redundant hidden nodes are deleted using the following methods: each hidden node is deleted from the network once in turn, and the remaining hidden nodes are used to construct the new ELM network and the new weight connecting coefficients are trained. The LOO error corresponding to each deleted hidden node is calculated and the hidden node with minimum error is considered as alternative deleting item. Compared to the current LOO error, if the new LOO error does not increase, this hidden node will be deleted. Otherwise, it will be kept and the algorithm is terminated.

All the above model selection methods are based on greedy algorithms, which will inevitably trapped into local minimum in determining the number of hidden nodes. Although some methods, such as the methods in [14,22,20], try to reduce the negative effect from greedy strategies by enlarging the size of candidate sets of hidden nodes, they may still fall into local optimal. In order to fix this problem, we impose a joint sparse constraints on linearly connected weights and formulate a convex

Then, we propose a Sparse Semi-Supervised Extreme Learning Machine (S3ELM) that can automatically prune the model structure via joint sparse regularization technology. To be clearer, we highlight the contributions of this paper as follows:

The proof of the convergence of S3ELM is shown.

Some experiments are taken on several benchmark datasets, and the results show that S3ELM is computationally attractive and outperforms its counterparts.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed S3ELM in detail. Theoretical analyses on the convergence and computational complexity of S3ELM provides in Section 3. The experimental results and analyses are provided in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section 5.

In this section, three related ELMs methods are briefly described, including the original ELM [17,4,7], Optimally Pruned ELM (OP-ELM) [29], and Semi-supervised ELM (SELM) [25]. They are closely related with S3ELM. So, we briefly review them to facilitate introducing S3ELM and comparison of S3ELM with them.

A large number of numerical experimental results in [17] show that ELM is an effective classification/regression method. For many UCI data sets [8], ELM obtains similar performance to (or even better performance than) SVM. The authors of [17] also illustrate that ELM can receive very stable classification/regression accuracy when the number of hidden nodes increases to 1000.

A large scale ELM network is chosen at first by OP-ELM [29], and then the importance of hidden nodes are ranked according to MRSR [33]. Finally, the most unimportant hidden nodes are deleted one by one until LOO error does not decrease any more.

                           After all the hidden nodes are added into ELM network, the ranking operation is finished. In the pruning stage, the least important nodes are deleted in turn. When LOO error increases, the algorithm terminates. When the weight connecting coefficient matrix is obtained, OP-ELM uses the same method to classify the testing sample with original ELM.

The original ELM adopts Frobenius-norm as the regularization, which controls the model complexity and ensures ELM has good generalization ability. However, Frobenius-norm is not a sparse regularization norm with which ELM networks are pruned difficultly.

                         are defined according to formulae (5)–(7). The pruning method used by formula (18) is similar with OP-ELM [29], both of which utilize the joint properties of some certain rows (or columns) in a matrix to prune. Their differences are that OP-ELM prunes the hidden nodes according to the correlation of the current residual vector and the columns of hidden layer output matrix

In the ELM-based classification, a large number of labeled instances are often required to achieve accurate classification. However, the labeled samples may hardly obtain for some practical application. It is a real issue how to guarantee the classification accuracy under the condition of the small size of the labeled samples. Similar to [25], we extend our method to semi-supervised algorithm which can make full use of unlabeled training samples to improve the recognition rate. Our model is formulated as:

                        -norm can overcome the numerical problem. (3) Using the new pruning method, S3ELM can adaptively select pruned hidden nodes. So, the new pruning method can reduce the number of parameters. The new pruning method still has some shortage, i.e. it may clear some useful hidden nodes. However, the probability that useful hidden nodes are cleared incorrectly is very low. The numerical experiments also illustrate that S3ELM obtains perfect recognition rate with the new pruning method.

                         is defined according to Eq. (28). Although formula (29) has many advantages, such as less parameters and simpler solving algorithm, we still using programming (19) in this paper. There are two reasons for it. (1) S3ELM aims at pruning the hidden nodes of ELM network. If 
                           
                              Y
                           
                         must not be equal to

                        , it is more flexible to optimize 
                           
                              W
                           
                        , which restricts more rows of 
                           
                              W
                           
                         to be equal to zero vectors by using 
                           
                              ‖
                              W

                        . So, smaller size of ELM network can be obtained by using formula (19). (2) We can convert formula (19) into an equivalent formation:

                         in the numerical experiments because the performance of S3ELM degenerates on some data sets when Eq. (30) is applied. We still do not know the reason for it which will be researched as one of our future works.

We have analyzed the main computational cost of S3ELM in training stage. In addition, because the pruning strategy in Section 2.5 is applied to S3ELM, the size of

                         are decreasing with the increasing t. So, the total computational cost of S3ELM in training stage is lower usually. With the fact that

                        , the overall computational cost of S3ELM in training stage is concluded as following theorem:

Compared with original ELM, the computational cost of S3ELM in testing stage can be reduced greatly if 
                           
                              S
                              ≪
                              L
                           
                        . In addition, the storage cost can also be saved greatly.

In this subsection, the convergence analysis of S3ELM is presented. The adopted analysis method is similar to the method in [30,10,12,40]. At first, a lemma should be given as follows:

                         are generated by S3ELM.

In this section, the performance of S3ELM is validated by several numerical experiments. Several related methods are used to compare with our proposed method, including, Original ELM,OP-ELM and SELM, which have been described in Section 2.1.

Nine data sets (or databases) are used to test the S3ELM. Firstly, three artificial data sets with nice manifold structures are employed to illustrate the function of graph Laplacian item. Secondly, S3ELM is test by four UCI data sets which shows the performance of S3ELM for classification problem from the real world. In the last, the two face databases are applied to test S3ELM because of the following three reasons: (I) it illustrates that S3ELM is effective for image data sets, (II) it shows that S3ELM is effective for multi-class classification problem since the face databases usually have more than ten classes, and (III) it illustrates that the good performance can be obtained by S3ELM only when the graph Laplacian 
                           
                              L
                           
                         should be calculated by different methods catering for the different data sets.

There are three artificial data sets and four UCI data sets [8] which are test in the immediately following two subsections. Table 1
                         shows the basic information of seven data sets, while Fig. 1
                         illustrates the distribution of three artificial data sets. For the seven data sets, we normalize the values of each feature in 
                           
                              [
                              -
                              1
                              ,
                              1
                              ]
                           
                        , while they has zero mean.

In Section 4.4 two face databases, i.e. JAFFE face database [42] and CMU PIE face database [43], are used for testing the performance of S3ELM applying to the image data. JAFFE face database contains 213 images of ten Japanese female models. There are about 21 frontal face images shot under the different facial expressions and lighting conditions for each model. Please refer to [42] for more details of JAFFE face database. CMU PIE face database contains more than 40,000 images from 68 persons. These images show the 13 different poses, 41 different illuminations and 4 different expressions of models. As the number of images in CMU PIE face database is so large, we just select 1470 images corresponding to the first 30 persons which belong to c05 data sets of CMU PIE face database in this experiment. Please refer to [43] for more details of CMU PIE face database and c05 data sets. All face images in the experiment are cropped and resized to order 
                           
                              32
                              ×
                              32
                           
                        . Then they are converted to the column vectors. The Principal Component Analysis method (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of these column vectors, which keeps the 99% energy. Please refer to the [38] (Section 4 in [38]) for more details about the PCA dimensionality reduction of face images.

In Sections 4.2 and 4.3, the two parameters of S3ELM are searching in the grid

In Section 4.4, a new method to construct the graph Laplacian 
                           
                              L
                           
                         is applied which is suitable for face data and need not any parameters. So, S3ELM and SELM need not the parameter 
                           
                              σ
                           
                         in Section 4.4. other parameters are adjusted according to the last paragraph. The new method to construct the graph Laplacian 
                           
                              L
                           
                         will be introduced in Section 4.4.

In this test, three artificial data sets and four UCI data sets are used for showing the performance of S3ELM. According to the method used in [17], the b and the elements of 
                           
                              a
                           
                         in G are generated from the uniform probability distribution on

                              ,
                              1
                              ]
                           
                         independent and identically distributed. In this experiment, we randomly select 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 labeled samples per class as labeled training samples. Then, the left samples are considered as unlabeled training samples for S3ELM (they are taken as the testing samples for original ELM and OP-ELM). For different parameters, 50 independent experiments are taken and the average results are calculated, which is shown in Tables 2–8
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        .

The bold data in Tables 2–8 are the best results among the different algorithms. Because codes of OP-ELM (which can be download from [41]) cannot output classification results for some experiments, the symbol ‘–’ is written in the corresponding position in the tables. The occurred errors of OP-ELM codes may be caused by too small training samples. The suffixes ‘RBF’ and ‘SIG’ represent that the algorithms (S3ELM, original ELM and OP-ELM) use RBF function and Sigmoid function as the activation function, respectively. For example, S3ELM-RBF represents the S3ELM algorithm with RBF function as the activation function and ELM-SIG represents the original ELM algorithm with Sigmoid function as the activation function. From the experimental results, we can see that the proposed method (S3ELM-RBF and S3ELM-SIG) can obtain better performance than the other two methods for the first five data sets. For the last two data sets, our method outperforms OP-ELM. Because of smaller scale of ELM network caused by pruning operation of S3ELM, it is reasonable that S3ELM is worse than ELM in few cases. However, in comparison to original ELM, S3ELM with the semi-supervised technology can also obtain the best results in most cases (especially for the case corresponding to less numbers of labeled training samples).

Then, we report the consumed time of the different algorithms in both training and testing stages. Thinking of too many tables need to be list if all CPU time in the experiments are reported, only three artificial data sets are used for testing the CPU time in this subsection. We think that they can illustrate the computational cost of S3ELM in both training and testing stages well. All the experiments in this subsection are run on a HP-G2160cx PC, with Pentium (R) Dual-Core CPU (E5800 3.20GHz) and 4GB memory.

                         show the training time of three algorithms. S3ELM spends more time on training stage than another two methods because our method is dependent on the sparse regularization (i.e.

                        -norm). Expensive computational cost is an obstacle for all the methods based on sparse representation. It is appeared that there is no optimization algorithm to overcome it yet. However, 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    ℓ

                        -norm decreases the size of ELM network and save the computational cost greatly in testing stage. The CPU time in testing stage is shown as follows.

Note that S3ELM is a semi-supervised method. The labels of unlabeled training samples can be predicted in the training stage. So, the CPU time in Tables 12–14
                        
                        
                         are obtained by using unlabeled training samples as testing samples. In another words, for unlabeled samples, the CPU time consumed by calculating hidden layer output matrix 
                           
                              H
                           
                         and approximation matrix of the real label matrix 
                           
                              Y
                              =
                              HW
                           
                         are reported in Tables 12–14.


                        Tables 12–14 shows the CPU time consumed by three methods in the testing stage. The data inside parentheses are the average number of hidden nodes corresponding to the best parameters. The average number of hidden nodes is 1000 for original ELM since it is not pruned. It is obvious that OP-ELM and S3ELM is far faster than original ELM. OP-ELM prunes more hidden nodes and faster than S3ELM. (The timing error of computer may cause that some of CPU time consumed by S3ELM is less than OP-ELM.) However, S3ELM has better recognition rates for the three data sets in comparison OP-ELM, which means OP-ELM prunes many useful hidden nodes.

For four UCI data sets, the numbers of hidden nodes of OP-ELM and S3ELM are shown in Table 15
                        .

In this subsection, S3ELM is compared with SELM. All the data sets are divided into three parts: labeled training data, unlabeled training data and testing data. In detail, we choose 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 samples respectively in each class as the labeled training samples, and the remaining data are divided into two parts: 90% of them are taken as unlabeled training samples and 10% as testing samples. Two methods are executed 50 times and the average accuracy rates are calculated. For all six data sets, the average accuracy rates corresponding to the best parameters are shown in the following tables. Each table is divided into two parts: part I shows the average accuracy rates about testing samples and part II shows the average accuracy rates about unlabeled training samples.

From Tables 16–22
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                         one can observe that our method can obtain better performance than SELM for Artificial data set 1, Banknote-authentication data set, Ionosphere data set and Transfusion data set. The results are similar for other two artificial data sets. Only for Planning-relax data set, SELM presents better performance than S3ELM. Taking the pruning function into account, a smaller sizes of ELM networks can be obtained by S3ELM. Therefore, S3ELM is faster than SELM in the testing stage. The numbers of the hidden notes for S3ELM are not reported because they are similar to the results in Section 4.2 (Tables 12–15).

In addition, to compare the numerical results from Tables 2–4 and Tables 16–18, the semi-supervised algorithms with graph Laplacian item (i.e. SELM and S3ELM) are much better than supervised algorithms (i.e. original ELM and OP-ELM) in the classification accuracy. Therefore, the numerical results of the three artificial data sets fully demonstrate the function of semi-supervised item for S3ELM.

For face recognition, it has been proved that graph Laplacian 
                           
                              L
                           
                         constructed by sparse representation is more effective [3,6,31]. Therefore, in this experiment, both of the SELM and S3ELM use sparse representation method to construct graph Laplacian

Similar with the settings in Section 4.2, some samples (face images) are chosen as labeled training samples and the left samples as unlabeled training samples for SELM and S3ELM (or as testing samples for original ELM). For different numbers of labeled training samples of each class and different face databases, all the three algorithms are executed 50 times and the average accuracy rates are calculated. Tables 23 and 24
                        
                         present the average accuracy rates of three algorithms corresponding to the best parameters. OP-ELM is not executed as a competitive algorithm because it cannot provide the final results in the part of 50 runs for all numbers of labeled training samples of each class and all face databases.

The results in Tables 23 and 24 show that S3ELM-RBF can obtain best performance and need less hidden nodes for CMU PIE30 face databases which reduce the computational cost remarkably. S3ELM-SIG may not converge in 200 iterations and does not prune any hidden node of ELM network. For JAFFE face databases, SELM-RBG, SELM-SIG and S3ELM-SIG obtain the highest recognition rate. However, S3ELM-SIG cannot prune enough hidden nodes of ELM network. In comparison to S3ELM-SIG, S3ELM-RBF obtains better pruning performance. Although the recognition rates decrease slightly, S3ELM-RBF can obtain higher efficiency in the testing stages.

In this paper, a new Sparse Semi-Supervised Extreme Learning Machine, named as S3ELM, is proposed for optimize the structure of ELM network. Compared to available ELMs, it has two characteristics: (1)

                                 ,
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                     -norm based pruning method which causes a convex mathematical model; (2) a semi-supervised regularization term integrated into the mathematical model which is effective use of unlabeled samples. Meanwhile, the optimization algorithm of proposed mathematical model and the analyses of convergency and computational cost of the proposed algorithm are provided. Some benchmark data sets: three artificial data sets, four UCI data sets (Banknote-authentication data set, Ionosphere data sets, Planning-relax data sets, and Transfusion data sets) and two facial databases are used to investigate the performance of S3ELM, and the experimental results show that: (1) S3ELM can prune hidden nodes of ELM network effectively, and save testing time and storage memory resource and (2) S3ELM can provide similar or better classification accuracies.

Although there are many advantages, S3ELM still needs to improve in many aspects. For example, the formula (19) has too many parameters. Although S3ELM is more flexible with them, it becomes problem how to select the value of the parameters. For another example, as all methods based on sparse representation, the computational cost consumed by S3ELM in training stage is very expensive. So, it is our tasks in the future to find the method to optimize parameters and develop fast algorithm for the programming with
