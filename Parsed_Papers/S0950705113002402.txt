                  Fuzzy regression models have been widely applied to explain the relationship between explanatory variables and responses in fuzzy environments. This paper proposes a simple two-stage approach for constructing a fuzzy regression model based on the distance concept. Crisp numbers representing the fuzzy observations are obtained using the defuzzification method, and then the crisp regression coefficients in the fuzzy regression model are determined using the conventional least-squares method. Along with the crisp regression coefficients, the proposed fuzzy regression model contains a fuzzy adjustment variable so that the model can deal with the fuzziness from fuzzy observations in order to reduce the fuzzy estimation error. A mathematical programming model is formulated to determine the fuzzy adjustment term in the proposed fuzzy regression model to minimize the total estimation error based on the distance concept. Unlike existing approaches that only focus on positive coefficients, the problem of negative coefficients in the fuzzy regression model is taken into account and resolved in the solution procedure. Comparisons with previous studies show that the proposed fuzzy regression model has the highest explanatory power based on the total estimation error using various criteria. A real-life dataset is adopted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed two-stage approach in handling a problem with negative coefficients in the fuzzy regression model and a large number of fuzzy observations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Regression analysis is usually adopted for investigating the relationships between independent (or input, explanatory) and dependent (or output, response) variables using a group of crisp observations in various research and application fields. The least-squares method is often applied to find regression coefficients to minimize the squared errors. In practice, observations are sometimes described in linguistic terms, such as “approximately equal to 100”, due to fuzzy, inexact, or insufficient information. In order to describe such fuzzy data, fuzzy set theory [36] is frequently adopted. Fuzzy regression models are developed to formulate a relationship between input and output variables in a fuzzy environment.

Tanaka et al. [30] were the first to propose a linear programming technique for determining fuzzy regression coefficients in the case of fuzzy dependent variables and crisp independent ones. Since then, fuzzy regression has been used by many researchers for applications and the development of methodologies [8,10,11,15,17,22,26,35]. Although Tanaka [28], Tanaka et al. [29], and Tanaka and Watada [31] made some improvements to Tanaka et al.’s [30] original fuzzy regression model, the improved models still suffer some shortcomings, such as over-sensitivity to outliers, as pointed out by Redden and Woodall [23]. Wang and Tsaur [32] stated that Tanaka et al.’s [30] model possibly produces excessively wide ranges of estimation. Furthermore, Kao and Chyu [12,13] showed that fuzzy regression coefficients broaden the spread of estimated responses when the magnitude of the independent variables increases, even though the actual spreads of the observed responses are approximately constant or decreasing. These flaws lessen the explanatory power of the model.

To overcome these problems, Kao and Chyu [12] proposed a two-stage procedure for determining the crisp coefficients and fuzzy error terms in fuzzy regression models based on Kim and Bishu’s [14] criterion. They also proposed a least-squares method to derive crisp regression coefficients [13]. Chen and Dang [5] improved Kao and Chyu’s [13] model and achieved better performance in the reduction of the total estimation error based on Kim and Bishu’s [14] criterion. Although several researchers [5,12,14] used Kim and Bishu’s [14] criterion to develop fuzzy regression models, the development of models using this criterion is flawed due to the fact that if the observed and estimated fuzzy responses do not intersect, the estimation error remains constant irrespective of the distance between the observed and estimated responses. In such circumstances, the measure does not reflect the actual difference between the responses. Another drawback commonly found in the literature is that the fuzzy regression model is limited to fuzzy observations with symmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers [7,9,14,20,25,33]. To minimize the distance between the observed and estimated fuzzy responses, Chen and Hsueh [2] considered fuzzy adjustment variables in the fuzzy regression models, and developed a mathematical programming method based on the distance criterion to determine the crisp regression coefficients and fuzzy adjustment variables simultaneously. In addition to dealing with non-symmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers, their approach has several advantages, including an effective reduction of the total estimation error, with the limitation that feasible solutions might not be found when the number of fuzzy observations is large.

In most existing approaches, fuzzy regression models are formulated with the assumption that the sign of regression coefficients is positive [2,7,9–13,20,25]. When the relationship of the fuzzy response and a fuzzy (or crisp) independent variable has the opposite change, the formulations may be incorrect based on fuzzy arithmetic. Recently, Bargiela et al. [1] developed an iterative algorithm that employs the gradient-descent optimization technique to determine possible negative coefficients for fuzzy multiple regression models to achieve the minimum sum of squared errors. In their approach, they used defuzzification methods to defuzzify the observed and the predicted fuzzy responses for demonstrating the performance of the proposed fuzzy regression model. Chen and Hsueh [3] proposed a least-squares method to construct fuzzy regression models by minimizing the total estimation error. The concept of correlation coefficients was adopted in their approach to find a possible opposite change between the fuzzy response and a fuzzy (or crisp) independent variable.

In the present study, a two-stage approach based on Kao and Chyu’s [12] and Chen and Hsueh’s [2] concepts is proposed to establish fuzzy regression models with crisp coefficients and resolve the problem of negative coefficients. Different from Chen and Hsueh’s [3] approach in which each correlation coefficient between the fuzzy response and a fuzzy (or crisp) independent variable must be calculated separately to find possible negative coefficients and which may require some iterations to determine the coefficients, the proposed approach is efficient. In the proposed approach, the fuzzy observations are first defuzzified into crisp values to calculate the crisp regression coefficients using the classical least-squares method. This stage constructs a defuzzified version of the fuzzy regression model. To incorporate the fuzziness of the input and/or output variables into the model, fuzzy adjustment variables are added into the model in the second stage. With the crisp regression coefficients treated as the known parameters, the fuzzy adjustment variables in the fuzzy regression models are determined using a mathematical program to minimize the total estimation error based on the distance concept. It is noted that the formulations of fuzzy regression models in the mathematical programming should consider the sign of the regression coefficient for each input variable based on the principle of fuzzy arithmetic.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates the fuzzy regression model with the fuzzy adjustment term. The solution approaches, namely the least-squares method and mathematical programming, are described in Section 3. In Section 4, three examples are used to illustrate applications, and the performance of the proposed models is compared with that of existing models. A fourth example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach to a problem with negative coefficients in the fuzzy regression model. In addition, a real-life dataset is used as a fifth example to demonstrate the ability of the proposed two-stage approach to deal with a large number of observations, where the established fuzzy regression model has negative coefficients. Conclusions are provided in the final section.

The traditional regression model is frequently used to express the relationship between the response and one or more explanatory variables. If the observations are fuzzy, the fuzzy regression model is applied to establish the relationship between the fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables. Let

Unlike existing models which have fuzzy regression coefficients [9,14,20,22,25,31,33,35], the regression coefficients in (2) are crisp values, so that the problem of fuzzy responses with wide estimation spreads due to large explanatory variables is avoided. However, if the explanatory variables are crisp, the predicted or estimated responses in (2) are also crisp, leading to a large fuzzy error for a fuzzy response [2]. To deal with this problem, Chen and Hsueh [2] added a fuzzy adjustment term

                     , which denotes a fuzzy number with the membership function

                     . For generalization, this concept is also adopted in the present study because it effectively resolves the problem. The membership function of a fuzzy adjustment term is a triangular fuzzy number when

                      is difficult, since fuzzy observations represented as fuzzy numbers with membership functions are considered in the model formulation. To overcome this problem, a two-stage approach is used to find the optimal coefficients and parameters. In the first stage, the fuzzy observations

                      are defuzzified into crisp values. In fuzzy problems, defuzzification is usually adopted for simplification. Since the fuzzy regression model contains some fuzzy numbers, the problem can be simplified by using a crisp number to represent each fuzzy number. The crisp numbers can then be used to determine the relationship between the corresponding fuzzy numbers and the fuzzy response. Many defuzzification approaches have been developed, among which the centroid method is commonly used in solving fuzzy problems [6,24]. The defuzzified (crisp) values,

The use of the conventional least-squares method to determine the crisp coefficients from (6) neglects the fuzziness of fuzzy observations, i.e., fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables. This may cause a large fuzzy error when applying the fuzzy regression model for prediction if the difference in the spreads of the fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables is great. As an extreme case, if the fuzzy input variables degenerate to crisp numbers, considered as special fuzzy numbers, the fuzzy estimation error will be very large.

That is, the established fuzzy regression model should maximize the overlaps of membership functions of the estimated and observed fuzzy responses to minimize the differences between them. An optimization approach should be developed to find the optimal solutions. However, it is difficult to directly solve a problem containing more than one fuzzy input variable to determine the optimal

Since a fuzzy number can be described by a group of its α-cuts [18], fuzzy mathematical problems are commonly solved by using the α-cuts of each fuzzy input and the fuzzy adjustment term to transform the problem into a common numerical problem.

The above expression is called the Hamming distance in distance measures [36]. The measure Di
                      is equivalent to the absolute difference of two real numbers if both the estimated and observed fuzzy numbers degenerate into crisp ones. The total fuzzy error for all fuzzy observations is

However, only a few α-cuts are required to characterize a fuzzy number when the membership functions of fuzzy numbers are triangular, as suggested by Chen and Lu [4].

From the solution approaches described above, some important points in the process of building fuzzy regression models are summarized below. To begin with, the crisp regression coefficients are determined in the first stage using the classical least-squares method so that the best-fitting regression model without considering fuzziness is obtained. The crisp regression coefficients represent the trend in scale between fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables. To include the fuzziness of the input and/or output variables into the model, the fuzzy adjustment term

                                 ̃
                              
                           
                        
                      is added into the model in the second stage, where 
                        
                           
                              
                                 δ

                      can increase the explanatory power of the established fuzzy regression model. To find the optimal

                                 δ

                      by minimizing the total estimation error based on the distance concept, ensuring that the maximum overlaps of membership functions of the estimated and observed fuzzy responses can be achieved. By employing the proposed two-stage approach, a fuzzy regression model that considers both the crisp relationship (the trend) and the fuzziness between the fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables is formulated. In addition, although the solution approach has two stages, the application is easy and the computations are efficient, since the least-squares method and the mathematical program can be solved by employing general commercial software packages.

This section presents five examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model. The first two examples were adopted from Tanaka et al. [29] and Sakawa and Yano [25], respectively, which are widely used for comparing the explanatory power of various fuzzy linear regression models. Only one input variable is considered in these examples. The third example, cited from Wu [34], contains two input variables. As mentioned before, few studies have considered negative coefficients in fuzzy regression models, and thus a fourth example that uses negative coefficients is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed fuzzy regression model. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed solution approach to real-life data, a fifth example that contains 506 observations from a dataset is adopted. Two α-cuts, α
                     =0 and 1, are adopted to build up the fuzzy regression model for the five examples using the proposed approach, since triangular fuzzy numbers are used to characterize the fuzzy observations in all examples.

To compare the performance of the proposed fuzzy regression model with that of existing models, a measure is needed to serve as the basis for evaluation and comparison. In the present paper, the proposed fuzzy regression model is established for minimizing the total error

A measure proposed by Kim and Bishu [14] for calculating the difference between the membership functions of the observed and estimated fuzzy responses has been adopted by a number of researchers [2,5,9,12,15,20]. The measure for the ith observation can be calculated as follows:

                           This example, designed by Tanaka et al. [29], contains five observations consisting of one fuzzy response and one crisp input variable. Several scholars, such as Kim and Bishu [14], Kao and Chyu [12,13], and Nasrabadi and Nasrabadi [20], also used this example to demonstrate the performance of their respective models. The five pairs of observations are represented as [

It should be noted that regression models THW and HBS were derived using only the α-cut at α
                        =0, whereas regression model NN was established using α
                        =0.6147. According to Wu and Tseng’s approach [33], if the explanatory variables are crisp values and the dependent variables are symmetric fuzzy numbers, the fuzzy regression model (WT) will be the same as the model (DM) obtained using Diamond’s approach [7]. It is easy to find that (15) and (17) are identical in this example.

To compare the performances of the above models, the absolute difference Di
                         based on two α-cuts, i.e., α
                        =0 and 1, and Kim and Bishu’s criterion were applied to calculate the error in estimating fuzzy responses, as shown in Tables 1 and 2
                        , respectively. The total estimation errors of the proposed approach (TW) were 5.660 for absolute difference and 9.102 for Kim and Bishu’s criterion.
                           Example 2
                           Consider the example designed by Sakawa and Yano [25]. All observations for the independent and response variables are symmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers, as shown in the second column of Table 3
                              . By defuzzifying these two fuzzy numbers via (5a) and (5b), the crisp coefficients can be obtained by applying the conventional least-squares method. Employing the mathematical programming model (10), the fuzzy regression model (TW) is established using the proposed method as:

Based on the two criteria, Tables 3 and 4
                         list the error of each observation and the total error in estimation for the above models. The two tables show that the performance of the proposed model (TW) is satisfactory in terms of total estimation error.
                           Example 3
                           This example has 15 pairs of fuzzy observations with two input variables and one response [34]. Asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers are used to characterize the input variables and response, as listed in Table 5
                              . Applying the proposed methods, the multiple fuzzy regression model is formulated as:

                         shows that the total estimation errors gradually converge when the number of α-cuts increases. With increasing number of α-cuts, the change of the total estimation errors for the two models in the trend seems the same as in the figure. This shows that only a few α-cuts are necessary to evaluate a fuzzy regression model when the membership functions of fuzzy numbers are triangular. In addition, as mentioned before, fuzzy regression coefficients could broaden the spread of estimated responses when the magnitude of the independent variables increases. In extreme cases, for the eighth fuzzy observations with a fuzzy input variable (12.0, 12.5, 13.0) and a fuzzy response (9.0, 9.5, 10.0) in the second example, the resulting estimated fuzzy responses and spreads from models TW, SY, and NN are [(9.120, 9.865, 10.611); 1.491], [(9.007, 10.438, 11.938); 2.931], and [(8.941, 10.414, 11.988); 3.047], respectively. This shows that the spreads of the estimated responses from models SY and NN become fuzzier than those from model TW and the observed fuzzy response.


                        
                           Example 4
                           This example is designed to demonstrate the proposed solution procedure for the fuzzy regression analysis with negative trends between the fuzzy explanatory variable and fuzzy response. Twenty sets of observations with four fuzzy input variables and one fuzzy response are considered. All the variables are asymmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers.

This example adopts the Boston Housing dataset from the machine learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing.html) to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed solution approach to real-life data. This dataset contains 506 numerical observations with 13 continuous and 1 binary-valued variables. For this demonstration, the binary-valued variable (the fourth one in the dataset) is removed since this study mainly deals with fuzzy-type data. Among the 13 variables, the twelfth variable in the dataset is considered as the response variable, with the remaining 12 variables indexed as

Under such conditions, to minimize rounding errors in computations and avoid the lack of comparability in regression coefficients, all variables including the response are standardized beforehand using [21]:

The above fuzzy regression model, similar to model (29) in the previous example, has several negative coefficients. In addition, to further investigate the performance of the proposed approach in this dataset, two- and fivefold cross validations are made using the fuzzified dataset. The results in terms of absolute difference are shown in Tables 7 and 8
                        
                        , respectively. Table 7 indicates that the absolute difference is large when the second half (254–506th) of observations are included in the training or testing data. Examining the original dataset, several particular response values, which are much smaller than the others, are found after the 405th observation, increasing the total estimation error (

                         values of the two runs in Table 7 are consistent, depending on whether those particular response values are involved. The above conditions also are demonstrated by the fivefold cross validation, as shown in Table 8. This shows that the established fuzzy regression model is applicable to real-life data with the proposed two-stage approach.

In practice, the investigation of relationship between several explanatory and response variables is usually made for various purposes. Among them, forecasting the future trend of a specified object is often found in diverse applications. Due to the uncertainty and complexity of the system, knowledge-based technologies are usually developed to achieve more accurate predictions. Predictions for bankruptcy [19], tourism demand [27], and stock prices [16] are some examples. As demonstrated above, the proposed two-stage approach can be effectively applied to establish fuzzy regression models using real-life data. For real applications with fuzzy, inexact, or insufficient information in an uncertain environment, the proposed approach can be implemented to construct fuzzy regression models for specified purposes, such as for prediction problems.

This paper proposed a two-stage approach to establish fuzzy regression models. To simplify the model-building processes, the fuzzy observations are first defuzzified into crisp numbers. The conventional least-squares method is then employed to determine the crisp regression coefficients, representing the trend in scale between fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables. However, the fuzziness of fuzzy observations is neglected in the defuzzification process. To incorporate the fuzziness into the model so as to reduce the fuzzy estimation error, a fuzzy adjustment term is included in the fuzzy regression model. The second stage of the proposed approach uses a mathematical programming model to determine the variables included in the fuzzy adjustment term in order to minimize total estimation error in terms of the absolute distance. The proposed two-stage approach is simple, since the conventional least-squares method and the mathematical programming model are used based on only a few α-cuts. The crisp regression coefficients avoid the possible fuzzy estimation error due to the larger magnitude of the input variables, as mentioned in the literature [12,13]. In addition, the crisp regression coefficients can be used to examine whether there is a negative trend between the fuzzy explanatory variable and fuzzy response, so that a more accurate model can be established.

From comparisons using three examples with existing models, the performance of the proposed two-stage approach is satisfactory in terms of the distance and the area measures, where some models were constructed based on the latter. The proposed two-stage approach was applied to negative regression coefficients in a fourth example. In addition, to demonstrate applicability to real-life data, a fifth example that contains 506 observations from a dataset was adopted. Via two- and fivefold cross validations, the proposed two-stage approach showed satisfactory performance.
