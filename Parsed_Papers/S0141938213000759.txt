                  Visual secret sharing (VSS) schemes based on visual cryptography (VC) or random grids (RGs) have been proposed in the past decade with the advantages of easy implementation, efficiency secret recovering and perfect security. As the concept of multiple secret images has gained more and more attention in academia, the novel concept of VC-based VSS with cyclic access structure has been discussed recently, which is a special case of multiple VSS, allowing participants to reconstruct the secret with the one next or last to him/her in a cyclic order. To obtain the benefit of RG-based VSS compared with VC-based VSS, this paper proposes the new VSS scheme with cyclic access structure for multiple secret images by random grids. The experimental results and theoretical security analysis demonstrate the feasibility.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

As cryptosystems such as DES, AES, and RSA [1] kept computational security, secret sharing is a well-known security system with perfect secrecy. Visual secret sharing (VSS) [2–11,17,18] applies one of the two main techniques: visual cryptography (VC) first proposed by Naor and Shamir [2] and random grids (RGs) by Kafri and Keren [3]. VSS schemes come to security research with the advantages such as easy implementation, efficiency in recovering the secret, no need of cryptographic knowledge and perfect security.

Generally speaking, VC-based VSS techniques often suffer from the problem of pixel expansion and the need of maintaining tailor-made codebook [4–11,18] while the RG-based VSS technique has no such weaknesses [12–14]. Thus it is advised to develop the RG-based VSS techniques.

In the literature, some milestones of RG-based VSS should be highlight to reveal the situation that there is much attention to pay in academia. In 2007, Shyu [12] proposed the new RG-based VSS schemes to encode both gray-level and color images. Shyu [13] and Chen and Tsao [14] proposed their own (2, n) and (n, n) RG-based VSS schemes.

In this paper, we consider a possible cyclic access structure under multiple participant condition for visual secret sharing. For n participants {P
                     1,
                     P
                     2,…,
                     Pn
                     }, each Pk
                     , where k
                     ∊{1,2,…,
                     n}, can only reconstruct the secret image by using his/her own share image with the participant’s index being next or last (Pk
                     
                     −1 or Pk
                     
                     +1 if k
                     −1=0, then take n; and if k
                     +1=
                     n
                     +1, take 1). Otherwise, (s)he reconstructs nothing with any other participant. The concept of VSS with cyclic access structure is illustrated in Fig. 1
                     . Therefore, the system totally has n secret images and n share images if there are n participants. This scheme can be adopted in the scenario in which the two predefined participants are assigned to share a secret, a cryptographic key for example, or these two participants need to authenticate each other.

Although there have been only few VSS schemes [15,16] with cyclic access structure so far, the presented schemes are based on visual cryptography (VC) technique; they still have above-mentioned weaknesses while the secret number n is limited to be even. In this paper, a new RG-based VSS scheme is presented to remove the drawbacks from VC-based while inheriting all its advantages. It is worthwhile to note that the limitation of even-numbered secrets is removed.

In the presented cyclic access structure, one generated random-grid must be stacked with the former to reveal one secret and stacked with next to reveal another secret. Thus, the main idea is to assign one half of pixels on a random-grid to encode one secret image and the other half for another secret image. The concept of referring is shown in Fig. 2
                     .

In the proposed scheme, there are two cases taken into account due to the number of secrets. With even-numbered secrets, the values of a half of grid-pixels in i-th (i being odd) random-grid are generated randomly. Then, the generated grid-pixels in i-th random-grid are used to generate half of grid-pixels in the next (i
                     +1)-th random-grid by referring to the corresponding i-th secret image. Likewise, with odd-numbered secrets, the same operations are performed except some grid-pixels of each random-grid are randomly determined by referring to neither the former random-grid nor the next. The concept is shown in Fig. 3
                     .

As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, it is obvious that between any two nonadjacent random-grids, no referencing relation exists with respect to any secret image. It implies that two nonadjacent random-grids cannot reconstruct any secret image.

Before describing the details of the proposed scheme, the notations used in the rest of paper are defined first.

Repeat Steps 1.1 and 1.2 until all grid-pixels of random-grids are determined.

When n is even, it is found that each grid-pixel of all random-grids is generated under two conditions. Hence, an example of n
                     =4 is given in Fig. 4
                      to illustrate the concept of design. For each random-grid, half of grid-pixels are correlated with the former random-grid and the secret image, and the rest grid-pixels are with the next random-grid and the secret image.

                        , the decoding process directly stacks two adjacent random-grids Gi
                         and G

In this section, the analysis of security and visual quality of the proposed scheme is illustrated. First of all, some definitions are given. Light transmission is defined to measure the lightness of area. And contrast is defined to measure two areas’ difference degree in visual with light transmissions.

                               is meaningless so that we cannot read the secret information

Hence, a successful secret image reconstruction happens in either Case 1 or Case 2, i.e. σ
                     ∊[−1,1]/{0}.

The security of the proposed cyclic VSS scheme is defined and demonstrated as follows. The security of 2-out-of-2 VSS is defined as that a random-grid alone reveals no information about the secret and the secret can be reconstructed upon two random-girds stacked. Since the random-grid is noise-like, it is meaningless for human beings.

By stacking two adjacent random-grids, the study reveals the corresponding secret. Otherwise, stacking two nonadjacent ones does not reveal any secret about secrets.
                           
                              
                                 Proof.

Stacking two adjacent random-grids demonstrates the visual quality by Proposition 2. Here, we demonstrate that stacking two nonadjacent random-grids cannot reveal any secret information. Suppose there are two nonadjacent random-grids Ga

The binary images in Fig. 6
                     (a–c), with the size of 1024×1024, are regarded as the test secret images. The three generated meaningless random-grids with the same size of secret images are shown in Fig. 6(d–f). Then the results of reconstructed secret images and the corresponding contrast values are shown in Fig. 6(g–i), where the notation ⊕ is the stacking operation. The experimental contrast values are pretty close to the theoretical value

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

To highlight the advantages of the proposed scheme, the functionality comparison is illustrated in Table 1
                     .
                        
                           While Noar and Shamir’s scheme [2] has pixel expansion rate with 4, this drawback can be removed by applying Kafri and Keren’s RG technique [3]. However, neither Ref. [2] nor [3] provides the cyclic access structure.

Although Ateniese et al.’s 
                              [15] and Uno 
                              and 
                              Kano’s 
                              [16] schemes presented the concept of cyclic access structure, two drawbacks are found: the pixel expansion rate of 4, and the assumption of even-numbered secrets.

Compared with the related work, the proposed scheme removes the disadvantages aforementioned. Table 1 tells the superiority of the proposed scheme.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

With cyclic access structure, the proposed RG-based VSS scheme provides a simple and efficient way to generate the shares for multiple secret images. The main advantages include (1) loosening limitation of secret number and (2) removing pixel expansion problem while security and visual quality are guaranteed.
