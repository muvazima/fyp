                  Quality function deployment (QFD) is one of the very effective customer-driven quality system tools typically applied to fulfill customer needs or requirements (CRs). It is a crucial step in QFD to derive the prioritization of design requirements (DRs) from CRs for a product. However, effective prioritization of DRs is seriously challenged due to two types of uncertainties: human subjective perception and customer heterogeneity. This paper tries to propose a novel two-stage group decision-making approach to simultaneously address the two types of uncertainties underlying QFD. The first stage is to determine the fuzzy preference relations of different DRs with respect to each customer based on the order-based semantics of linguistic information. The second stage is to determine the prioritization of DRs by synthesizing all customers’ fuzzy preference relations into an overall one by fuzzy majority. Two examples, a Chinese restaurant and a flexible manufacturing system, are used to illustrate the proposed approach. The restaurant example is also used to compare with three existing approaches. Implementation results show that the proposed approach can eliminate the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts and model customer heterogeneity and design team’s preference. Due to its easiness, our approach can reduce the cognitive burden of QFD planning team and give a practical convenience in QFD planning. Extensions to the proposed approach are also given to address application contexts involving a wider set of HOQ elements.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Nowadays, with short life-cycles and dynamic competition in global markets, the major challenge of any product-oriented firm is how to efficiently design, develop, and manufacture new products that will be preferred more by customers than those offered by competitors (Chen & Ko, 2010). Essentially, a product’s success depends largely on how it meets customer needs or requirements (CRs). On one hand, the CRs are obtained through a survey conducted by the marketing department, and the output of this is a list of qualitative customer attributes, such as “easy to use”, “resistant” or “durable”. On the other hand, the design team has to make the product specifications satisfy what the customers want. The design specifications are based on engineering properties with a quantitative nature, such as “automated guided vehicle”, “storage and retrieval system” or “programmable logic controller”. In this sense, conflict can arise between marketing and engineering departments, as they speak different languages (Hauser & Clausing, 1988).

Quality function deployment (QFD) is one of the very effective customer-driven quality system tools typically applied to fulfill customer needs and, more importantly, to improve customer satisfaction (Chan & Wu, 2002a; 2002b; Chen and Ko, 2011). The most commonly seen QFD consists of four inter-linked stages: Stage 1 to translate CRs into design requirements (DRs); Stage 2 to translate important DRs into product characteristics; Stage 3 to translate important product characteristics into manufacturing operations; and Stage 4 to translate key manufacturing operations into operations and control. Each stage’s important outputs (HOWs), generated from the stage’s inputs (WHATs), are converted into the next stage as its inputs (new WHATs), i.e., each stage can be described by a two dimensional matrix of “WHATs” and “HOWs”, which is easy and convenient to deal with in practice (Chan and Wu, 2005).

The first stage of QFD, also known as house of quality (HOQ), is of fundamental and strategic importance, since it is in this stage that the CRs (WHATs) for the product are identified and converted into appropriate DRs (HOWs) to fulfil customer satisfaction. In other words, HOQ links the “voice of the customer” to the “voice of the technician”, through which the process and production plans can be developed in the other stages of the QFD system, as depicted in Fig. 1
                     . The structures and analyzing methods of the other three QFD stages are essentially the same as the first one (Liu & Wu, 2008). Therefore, instead of the entire four stages, most QFD studies focus mainly on the first stage to prioritize DRs (HOWs) from CRs (WHATs; e.g., Chen et al., 2006; Ho et al., 1999; Yan et al., 2013), which is also the main focus of our current work.


Successful implementation of QFD often requires a significant number of subjective judgments from both customers in a targeted market and a QFD design team in a firm. Such a number of subjective judgments will inevitably generate the following two types of uncertainties for prioritizing DRs in the process of QFD planning.

                        
                           •
                           The first type of uncertainty is the human assessment and judgment on qualitative attributes, which are always subjective and imprecise. Hence, the input information of human perception can be ambiguous, which presents a special challenge to effective prioritization of DRs (Chen et al., 2006).

The second type of uncertainty is the involvement of many customers and the QFD design team in the evaluation of input information of QFD. Input information may have an uncertainty associated with customer heterogeneity because each customer may have a different opinion (Kwong et al., 2011; Wang, 2012).

In the past two decades, we have witnessed many studies focusing on these two types of uncertainties in the literature, as reviewed in Section 2.1.

Regarding the first type of uncertainty, it has been found that all existing studies of uncertain QFD have quantified subjective judgments in terms of fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1965), which is in fact the process of transforming an ordinal scale into a cardinal scale that represents an “arbitrary passage”. Such a quantification may sometimes be dangerous (Han et al., 2004), since the fuzzy set based semantics of linguistic labels is often defined subjectively and context-dependently. Consequently, it is easy to generate different results by choosing different scales from which to draw the ordinals. Moreover, even if the quantification process used is rational, existing studies of uncertain QFD perform calculations with the associated fuzzy membership functions of linguistic labels based on fuzzy extension principle (Zadeh, 1965). Such a procedure has, as any fuzzy computation-based approach, an unavoidable limitation of information loss caused by the process of linguistic approximation, which consequently implies a lack of precision in the final result and has been well verified by Herrera and Martínez (2000) in the general context of fuzzy linguistic decision-making. Finally, as observed by Tidd and Bodley (2002), many tools even if available within the firm are not used since they are too complex to be used. Since it is complex and time-consuming to apply QFD in practice (Chan and Wu, 2005), the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts and calculation in terms of fuzzy sets may build an obstacle for the design team to use QFD. With respect to the second type of uncertainty, due to the heterogeneity of customer inputs, it is necessary and important to consider the customer variability so as to derive a robust prioritization of DRs (HOWs; Kwong et al., 2011). As a basic element underlying group decision-making, the concept of fuzzy majority is accepted by most of its members in practice, since it is quite difficult for the solution to be accepted by all users (Kacprzyk et al., 2008). Such a concept of fuzzy majority may represent the design team’s preference, which plays an important role in QFD. Therefore, it may provide a better solution to prioritize the DRs by considering the concept of fuzzy majority in uncertain QFD, which is missed in the literature.

Toward this end, the main focus of this paper is to simultaneously cope with the two types of uncertainties underlying QFD by a novel group decision-making approach. Firstly, the proposed approach performs computations solely based on the order-based semantics of linguistic input information. Moreover, it performs the group aggregation of fuzzy preference relations based on the concept of fuzzy majority underlying group decision-making. An exponential Regular Increasing Monotone (RIM) quantifier is used to express the fuzzy majority. Finally, it utilizes the fuzzy majority to derive a consensus degree for the uncertain QFD problem. As we shall see, the proposed approach, on one hand, can eliminate the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts in QFD; on the other hand, it incorporates the fuzzy preference relation and fuzzy majority into uncertain QFD so as to model the customer variability and the design team’s attitudinal preference.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews existing approaches to uncertain QFD and formulates our research problem. Section 3 presents how to derive the fuzzy preference relations from users’ subjective judgments. Section 4 proposes the group aggregation of individual fuzzy preference relations based on the concept of fuzzy majority. A consensus degree based on fuzzy majority is also given for the uncertain QFD problem. Section 5 examines two examples, a Chinese restaurant and a flexible manufacturing system, to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The restaurant example is also used to compare with three existing studies. For the completeness of this study, some considerations and potential ways are discussed in Section 6 to handle other factors in a potentially more comprehensive HOQ model. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 7 with some remarks.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Several attempts have been made in order to cope with the two types of uncertainties underlying the QFD problem: human subjective perception and customer heterogeneity. To cope with the first type of uncertainty, numerical studies have been conducted on how to prioritize DRs (HOWs) with fuzzy linguistic variables (Zadeh, 1975) semantically represented by fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1965). For example, Khoo and Ho (1996) developed an approach based on possibility theory and fuzzy arithmetic to address the ambiguity involved in various relationships and outlined the framework of a fuzzy linguistic QFD. Zhou (1998) proposed an approach to prioritize DRs through a fuzzy ranking procedure and to optimize improvements using a mixed integer programming approach, in which the relative importance of CRs were determined by the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and were assumed to be crisp numbers. Wang (1999) used fuzzy arithmetic to compute the technical importance ratings of DRs and the outranking approach based on possibility and necessity measures to prioritize DRs. Shen et al. (2001) employed fuzzy arithmetic to calculate the fuzzy priority weights of DRs and defuzzified them using the mean of maxima method and the centroid defuzzification method. Ertay et al. (2005) prioritized DRs by taking into account the degree of interdependence between CRs and DRs, and the inner dependence among them. Liu (2005) devised a method that could prioritize DRs without knowing their exact membership functions by means of fuzzy weighted aggregation (FWA; Liou & Wang, 1992; Kao & Liu, 2001). Chen et al. (2006) calculated the priority weights of DRs using the FWA and fuzzy expected value (FEV) operator (Liu & Liu, 2002). Kwong et al. (2007) developed a new methodology to calculate the importance weights of DRs based on the fuzzy expert systems approach. Chen and Ko (2011) considered the four stages of QFD to build a series of FWA approaches for determining the fulfillment levels of each decision outcome for customer satisfaction. The readers can refer to Chen and Weng (2006),Kim et al. (2000), and Temponi et al. (1999) for other fuzzy QFD studies.

In order to address the second type of uncertainty caused by the variability of user inputs, several studies have considered group decision-making approaches to uncertain QFD. For example, Ho et al. (1999) proposed an integrated group decision-making approach to consolidate individual preferences into a group consensus by using a point-scoring scale in QFD. Karsak (2004) employed the fuzzy Delphi method to determine the relative importance weights of CRs based on a consensus measure and Wasserman (1993)’s procedure to normalize the fuzzy relationships between CRs and DRs. The priority weights of DRs were then defined as the sum of the products of the relative importance weights and the normalized fuzzy relationships. Kwong et al. (2011) proposed a two-stage fuzzy group decision-making approach to uncertain QFD, in which the FWA method and FEV operator were first used to derive a ranking order of DRs under each customer’s judgment, and then all customers’ preferences on the ranking of DRs were synthesized via 0-1 integer programming to achieve a consensus ranking. Wang (2012) proposed a different fuzzy group decision-making procedure for prioritizing DRs under uncertainty based on FWA method and defuzzification method, by aggregating the technical importance ratings of DRs under each combination of each customer and each design team member. Chen et al. (2013) proposed a systematic procedure for constructing the HOQ from a perspective of group decision-making, in which a modified fuzzy clustering approach was proposed to find the consensus of the design team.

In summary, all existing studies focusing on the first type of uncertainty have quantified the subjective judgments in terms of fuzzy sets and performed calculations with the associated fuzzy membership functions of linguistic labels based on fuzzy extension principle. Consequently, they have the problems of quantification, information loss, and an obstacle to use in practice, as introduced in Section 1. Moreover, the limited studies focusing on the second type of uncertainty, on one hand, also have the problems existed in those focusing on the first type of uncertainty. On the other hand, they have not considered the concept of fuzzy majority. As a result, design team’s preference is missed in these studies. In order to overcome the drawbacks of existing approaches, it is necessary and important to develop a more suitable methodology for prioritizing DRs in uncertain QFD with the consideration of the two types of uncertainties, simultaneously.

A full HOQ can consist of as many as 18 elements or concepts (Chan & Wu, 2002a; Chan and Wu, 2005): customers, CRs (WHATs), correlation matrix of WHATs, relative importance ratings of WHATs, competitors, customer competitor assessments, goals for WHATs, sales-point, final importance ratings of WHATs, DRs (HOWs), correlation matrix of HOWs, relationship matrix of WHATs versus HOWs, improving directions of HOWs, technical competitor assessment, goals for HOWs, probability factors, importance ratings of HOWs. Due to the high difficulty of implementing a HOQ in practice (Cristiano et al., 2001), it is both difficult and unnecessary to include all the 18 HOQ elements described above (Chan and Wu, 2005). In fact, different users build different HOQ models involving different elements from the above list. The most simply but widely used HOQ model contains only the customers, the CRs (WHATs) and their relative importance, DRS (HOWs) and their relationships with the WHATs, and the importance weights of the HOWs (e.g., Chen et al., 2006; Kwong et al., 2011). According to the literature review in Section 2.1, all existing studies have the problems of quantifying qualitative concepts in terms of fuzzy sets. Therefore, the most simply but widely used HOQ model will be used in this paper to facilitate practical applications and to clearly show the main differences between our proposed approach and existing approaches. This, however, does not imply other factors’ unimportance in the HOQ process and future effort should be made to handle them properly. As an extension, later in Section 6, we will elaborate more on these omitted parts and also indicate possible ways to include them into an even more complete HOQ model.

The first step in our QFD context is to identify the customers of a product or service to be surveyed in a targeted market. The producing firm should know who are the real customers for the product concerned. There are generally three types of customers (Chan & Wu, 2002a; Chan and Wu, 2005): internal customers such as shareholders, managers and employees; intermediate customers such as wholesale people and retailers; and ultimate customers such as recipients of service, purchasers, institutional purchasers. Usually the main focus is on the ultimate customers who could be identified through previous information and marketing research. Formally, let 
                           
                              C
                              =
                              {
                              
                                 C
                                 1
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 C
                                 2
                              
                              ,
                              …
                              ,
                              
                                 C
                                 K
                              
                              }
                           
                         be a set of customers, where 
                           
                              |
                              C
                              |
                              =
                              K
                           
                        .

Secondly, it is important for the firm to understand what customers need for a product, otherwise you cannot know how to satisfy your customers and thus how to keep your business successful. The CRs (WHATs) are usually expressed in customers’ words that can be collected by various methods by the firm’s marketing department, or by an outside marketing or information gathering agency. Available methods to collect CRs include focus group, individual interviews, listening and watching, and using existing information (Chan and Wu, 2005). It is suitable and economical to gather CRs (WHATs) through focus group and individual interviews of the K customers. It is of great help to group related CRs into a category in analyzing the CRs. Affinity diagram and cluster analysis may be used to arrange random data into natural and logical groups so as to organize CRs. Formally, let 
                           
                              CR
                              =
                              {
                              
                                 CR
                                 1
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 CR
                                 2
                              
                              ,
                              ⋯
                              ,
                              
                                 CR
                                 M
                              
                              }
                           
                         be a set of WHATs, which could be classified into some meaningful categories according to practical situations.

Thirdly, the WHATs are usually of different degrees of importance and it is a common practice for the firm to focus more on the important WHATs. Therefore, the importance of CRs has then to be determined to continue the QFD process. This stage is essential because consequent technical DRs (HOWs) are determined based on the importance of CRs. It is usually difficult for the design team to directly assign priority measures to a list of customer voice (CRs). Therefore, the K customers are asked to provide their judgments for the importance of CRs. In this step, focus groups and individual interviews are usually not suitable for collecting quantitative information about the importance ratings of CRs due to their high costs (Chan & Wu, 2002a). One appropriate way of obtaining customers’ perceptions is by a survey study involving the K customers according to their direct experiences (Temponi et al., 1999). In order to help the K customers reveal their perceptions about the product, a linguistic variable

                         as shown in Table 1
                        (indexed by “Importance ratings”).

                           Remark 1
                           In general, a sufficient number of customers should be surveyed to provide a statistical significance (Chan & Wu, 2002a). However, only a small number of customers are asked to provide their judgments for the importance of WHATs in the literature, e.g., K = 5 (Chan and Wu, 2005; Liu & Wu, 2008) and K = 10 (Chen et al., 2006). The main reason may come from the fact that the K customers are the ones in the focus group to identify the CRs. A focus group usually consists of 8–12 randomly selected customers, who reveal their perceptions about the product according to their direct experiences. Consequently, the K customers may not provide a statistical significance, but may be viewed as “experts”. In fact, Kwong et al. (2011) and Wang (2012) have treated the HOQ as a group decision-making problem due to the small number of customers in the survey.

Fourthly, the firm’s technicians or product development team should develop a set of DRs (HOWs) to capture the WHATs in measurable and operable technical terms. The DRs could be generated from current product standards or selected by ensuring through cause-effect analysis that the DRs are the first-order causes for the CRs. Formally, a set of DRs collected from the design team can be expressed as 
                           
                              DR
                              =
                              {
                              
                                 DR
                                 1
                              
                              ,
                              ⋯
                              ,
                              
                                 DR
                                 N
                              
                              }
                              ,
                           
                         where 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              |
                              DR
                              |
                           
                        . If necessary, these HOWs could also be organized into some manageable categories by means of the affinity diagram or cluster analysis.

Finally, translations from CRs to technical DRs are carried out by a QFD design team. This is an important work in HOQ/QFD which is performed carefully and collectively by technicians. The relationship between a DR and a CR is usually determined by analyzing to what extent the DR could technically relate to and influence the CR by making use of a linguistic variable

                        . The relationships can be positive or negative, strong or weak. All these relationships form a matrix with the CRs as rows and the DRs as columns. Formally, the linguistic judgment for the relationship between customer need m and design requirement n given by the design team is denoted by

                         as shown in Table 1 (indexed by “Relationships between CRs and DRs”).

With the linguistic evaluation data collected, we then aim at developing a suitable computing method that allows for deriving a priority vector of the DRs, so as to support the prioritization decision of uncertain QFD. A novel group decision-making approach consisting of two stages will be proposed, the flowchart of which is depicted in Fig. 2
                        . The first stage is to determine the fuzzy preference relations of different DRs with respect to each customer based on the order-based semantics of linguistic information. The second stage is to determine the prioritization of DRs by synthesizing all customers’ fuzzy preference relations into an overall representative one by means of the concept of fuzzy majority.

In our uncertain QFD context, the linguistic information is used to represent the subjective judgments collected from both the surveyed customers in a targeted market and the QFD design team in a firm, respectively. We assume a matrix of fuzzy preference relations is derived from the linguistic judgments so as to eliminate the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts in uncertain QFD, which essentially underlies the calculating basis of order-based semantics of linguistic labels. Note that the fuzzy preference relations are employed to reflect an omnipresent fact that the preferences may be not clear-cut so that conventional non fuzzy preference relations may be not adequate (Kacprzyk et al., 2008).

Looking at Table 1, we have a set of M customer needs and a set of K customers. The customers are asked to provide their importance judgements for different CRs, respectively. The importance judgment for customer need m provided by customer k is denoted by

                        In Eq. (4), the normalized principal eigenvector is used to derive a weighting vector of the CRs under each customer. In fact, the multiplicative preference relations play a basic role in the AHP (Saaty, 1986). If DI

                           In practice, it is quite difficult to obtain a perfectly consistent matrix of fuzzy preference relations. Fortunately enough, Xu et al. (2009) have proved that even if a matrix is not additive transitive, i.e., not perfectly consistent, we can also derive the weighting vector by means of the normalized principal eigenvector.

                      obtained, our uncertain QFD transforms to a group decision-making problem, which needs to synthesize the K matrices into an overall representative one. In this section, we shall propose our prioritization solution based on the concept of fuzzy majority. Before doing so, we first briefly recall some basic concepts of fuzzy majority based on the exponential generating functions (Liu, 2006).

One of the main problems in group decision-making is to define a decision strategy which takes into account the individual opinions of the experts and to synthesize them into an overall representative opinion. The reduction of the experts’ opinions into an overall representative one is usually performed through an aggregation process. The concept of majority is a basic element underlying group decision-making: what is often needed is an overall opinion which synthesizes the opinions of the majority of the experts. The term “majority” indicates that a solution is accepted by most of its members, since in practice it is quite difficult for the solution to be accepted by all. In this case the goal is to obtain a value which can be considered as the opinion of a majority, that is, a value that is similar for any large group of experts, what we can call the majority opinion.

The concept of fuzzy majority is used to make the strict concept of majority more vague so as to make it closer to its real human perception (Kacprzyk et al., 2008). A natural manifestation of such a “soft” majority is the so-called linguistic quantifiers as, e.g., most, at least half, as many as possible, etc., so as to express the quantity of the experts which one wants to take into account. Zadeh (1983) suggested a formal representation of these linguistic quantifiers using fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1965), i.e., any relative quantifier can be expressed as a fuzzy subset Q of the unit interval [0, 1]. In this representation for any proportion x ∈ [0, 1], Q(x) indicates the degree to which x satisfies the concept conveyed by the term Q. Yager (1996) further defined a Regular Increasing Monotone (RIM) quantifier to represent the linguistic quantifier. A fuzzy subset Q of the universe domain [0, 1] is called a RIM quantifier if

                        which is equal to the area under a RIM quantifier. The semantics associated with the parameter α depends upon the application at hand. When using the quantifier Q to approach logical connectives between the and and or, the value α can be associated with a measure of the degree of orness associated with an aggregation. When the quantifier Q is used to implement different procedures for approaching subjective attitudes in decision-making under uncertainty, α can be associated with degree of optimism of a decision-maker. Since we want to model the group behaviors of uncertain QFD, α is viewed as the optimism index of the uncertain QFD planning process. In this context,

                           
                              •
                              when α < 0.5 it indicates that the decision-maker has a pessimistic attitude toward the reliability of customers, the value α = 0.0 means that the decision-maker is absolutely pessimistic;

when α = 0.5, it indicates that the decision-maker has a neutral attitude toward the reliability of customers;

and when α > 0.5 it means that the decision-maker has an optimistic attitude toward the reliability of customers, the value α = 1.0 means the decision-maker is absolutely optimistic.

Obviously, it is an important issue to define the membership function for a quantifier in group decision-making. Until now, a quantifier’s membership function is often determined by intuition (e.g., Zadeh, 1983; Yager, 1988). The main drawbacks of such a way are that the quantifiers defined by intuition are often incomparable and the aggregation results are inconsistent in real applications (Liu, 2006). Recently, Liu (2006) has proposed a way to derive the membership function of a RIM quantifier Q from the orness value α based on the exponential generating function of a RIM quantifier, which will used in this paper. The readers can refer to Appendix  A for more detail about the exponential RIM quantifier and its implementation.

We now consider how to derive our prioritization solution based on the concept of fuzzy majority, which is guided by the exponential RIM linguistic quantifier Q. In our context, the linguistic quantifier Q expresses the quantity of the customers which the QFD design team wants to take into account. A linguistically quantified statement for our QFD problem can be written as “QCs are convinced”, which may be exemplified by

                           “The QFD design team is α optimistic that customers (Cs) are convinced (★)”.
                        
                     

Such a linguistic statement can be solved by an aggregation function. To solve the linguistic statement (★), we will build our group aggregation based on Kacprzyk et al. (2008) following the scheme:

Now we consider how to utilize fuzzy majority in terms of the exponential RIM linguistic quantifier Q to define a consensus degree of our uncertain QFD problem. Such a consensus degree is borrowed from Kacprzyk et al. (2008) and meant to overcome some rigidity of the conventional concept of consensus, in which full consensus occurs only when “all the customers agree on the solution”.

Our starting point to the consensus degree is again the K matrices D

In this section, we shall apply our proposed approach to prioritize the basic HOWs (DRs) of two examples borrowed from the literature. Our main attempt here is to present a generalized model based on past studies that can then be modified or extended for use in a specific situation or firm. Moreover, the examples provide illustrations of the steps required to apply the methodology in practice; they can be summarized as follows.

                        
                           •
                           
                              Step 1: Determine customers and customer needs (CRs/WHATs). The customers are then asked to linguistically rate the importance of the WHATs.


                              Step 2: Determine HOWs and ask the design team to linguistically judge the relationships between HOWs and WHATs.


                              Step 3: With the importance ratings and relationships between HOWs and WHATs, as shown in Table 1, prioritize the DRs (HOWs) based on the proposed approach.

                                 
                                    •
                                    
                                       Step 3.1: Calculate the normalized importance weights of different WHATs under each customer via Eq. (4).


                                       Step 3.2: Derive a matrix of individual fuzzy preference relations of different HOWs with respect to each customer via Eq. (6).


                                       Step 3.3: Induce the prioritization of the HOWs via Eqs. (10)–(14).


                                       Step 3.4: Calculate the consensus degree via Eqs. (15)–(18).

The example of discussing the basic HOWS (DRs) of a fried Chinese vegetable (Chan and Wu, 2005) in a Chinese restaurant is first revised here to illustrate the concepts and computations in our proposed HOQ model in details. A Chinese restaurant, called restaurant, wishes to make an improvement on a fried Chinese vegetable it cooks and sells everyday in response to the competition of other Chinese restaurants in the same district. HOQ technique can help make the appropriate decision resulting in better improvement. The basic idea is (1) to understand what are customer needs for a fried Chinese vegetable (such as “not greasy” and “fresh”) and then to identify the important ones through customer surveys, and (2) to associate the customer needs with appropriate technical measures or solutions (such as “amount of edible oil used” and “duration of vegetable storage”) and then to find the important ones through technical analyses.

At first, the restaurant must know who are the customers for its fried Chinese vegetable. This information could be obtained by observing who order the fried Chinese vegetable or through market survey. Five of the restaurants’ customers are selected to help conduct the HOQ analysis. By one or more focus groups, these five customers identify 10 needs (WHATs) for the fried Chinese vegetable. They are: “CR1: Appetizing”, “CR2: Jade color”, “CR3: Fresh”, “CR4: Hot (High temperature)”, “CR5: Moderately spicy”, “CR6: Not greasy”, “CR7: Not overcooked”, “CR8: Tasteful arrangement”, “CR9: Not salty”, and “CR10: Sweet smell”. The 10 WHATs can hardly be of same importance to the customers. Consequently, the five customers are asked to reveal their perceptions on the relative importance of the 10 WHATs using the following linguistic variable

                           
                              (19)

                                       1
                                    
                                    =
                                    
                                       {
                                       Very
                                       
                                       low,
                                       
                                       Low,
                                       
                                       Moderate,
                                       
                                       High,
                                       
                                       Very
                                       
                                       high
                                       }
                                    
                                    .
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                        Table 2
                        shows their assessments where, for example, customer 1 (C
                        1) rates the relative importance of customer need 1 (CR1) as “High”.

After careful considerations, restaurant’s cooks (design team) propose nine technical measures (HOWs) that relate to and can help realize the 10 WHATs. These HOWs are “DR1: amount of soy sauce used”, “DR2: amount of salt used”, “DR3: amount of pepper used”, “DR4: amount of vegetable used”, “DR5: amount of edible oil used”, “DR6: duration of vegetable storage”, “DR7: duration between finished and served”, “DR8: duration of cooking”, and “DR9: duration of high temperature used in cooking”. Then the cooks begin to establish the relationships between the HOWs and the WHATs, or to examine to what extent each HOW is related to and can technically measure each WHAT. Each HOW’s relationships with the WHATs are always examined once the HOW is considered. The relationships between the HOWs and the WHATs are determined by technical analysis and empirical judgment with the following linguistic variable

                           
                              (20)

                                       2
                                    
                                    =
                                    
                                       {
                                       Very
                                       
                                       weak,
                                       
                                       Weak,
                                       
                                       Moderate,

                                       strong
                                       }
                                    
                                    .
                                 
                              
                           
                        The full matrix of these relationships are shown in Table 3
                        where, for example, the cooks consider the relationship between DR1 and CR1 as “Very strong”.

With the linguistic judgments provided by the five customers and the cooks (QFD design team), we are able to derive the matrix of fuzzy preference relations for each customer, respectively. Firstly, we calculate a matrix DI
                        
                           k
                         of fuzzy preference relations of different WHATs (CRs) from customer k ( Ck
                        )’s subjective judgments, according to Eq. (2). Then, a weighting vector 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    W
                                 
                                 k
                              
                              =
                              
                                 (
                                 
                                    W
                                    
                                       1
                                    
                                    k
                                 
                                 ,
                                 …
                                 ,
                                 
                                    W
                                    
                                       10
                                    
                                    k
                                 
                                 )
                              
                           
                         associated with the 10 WHATs can then be derived from the matrix DI
                        
                           k
                         with respect to customer k, according to Eq. (4). Table 4
                        shows the weighting vectors of the 10 WHATs with respect to the five customers.

Secondly, we can obtain a matrix DII
                        
                           m
                         of fuzzy preference relations of the nine HOW (DRs) from the cooks’ subjective judgements for the relationships between CRs and DRs with respect to customer need m. Taking the weighting vector W
                        
                           k
                         into account, we can obtain a matrix D
                        
                           k
                         of the fuzzy preference relations of DRs with respect to customer k according to Eq. (7). Taking customer 1 (C
                        1) as an example, the derived matrix of fuzzy preference relations of the nine DRs is derived as shown in Table 5
                        .

Thirdly, we perform the group aggregation of the K individual matrices (D
                        
                           k
                        , k = 1, …, 5) into an overall representative one by means of the solution introduced in Section 4.2. We first consider the aggregation without using the concept of fuzzy majority, the priority values are shown as

                           
                              (21)

                        which indicates the following prioritization of the nine HOWs: DR5≻DR1≻DR2≻DR9≻DR8≻DR7≻DR6≻DR3≻DR4, i.e., the priority value of DR5 is 1.0, which indicates that DR5 is the most important design requirement; whereas DR4 is the most unimportant one with a priority value 0.

Now, we consider incorporating the exponential RIM quantifier to model the concept of fuzzy majority. Consequently we can obtain different prioritization information of the nine HOWs under different α values, as shown in Table 6
                        , which has the following interesting properties

                           
                              •
                              When α = 0, the priority values of DRs are always 0 except the one of DR5. The main reason is that in this case the cooks are absolutely pessimistic and only the priority value of DR5 is equal to 1. In this case, only one important HOW can be selected from 
                                    
                                       DR
                                       ,
                                    
                                  i.e., the cooks only need to pay attention to DR5.

When α = 1, DR4 is the most unimportant design requirement, whereas the remaining HOWs (DRs) are all the most important ones with a priority value 1. The main reason is that in this case the cooks are in fact absolutely optimistic and the priority values of the HOWs are greater than 0 except the one of DR4.

When α = 0.5, the final priority information with fuzzy majority is the same as the one without using fuzzy majority. The main reason is that in this case the cooks in fact have a neutral attitude and the quantifier is defined as Q(x) = x, which will be provided as a default recommendation to the cooks.

When α ∈ (0, 0.5) or α ∈ (0.5, 1), the priority ranking of the nine HOWs is DR5≻DR1≻DR2≻DR9≻DR8≻DR7≻DR6≻DR3≻DR4. Since the exponential RIM quantifier Q is monotonically non-decreasing with α, the priority information with respect to each design requirement is monotonically non-decreasing with α.

In addition, it is observed from Table 6 that different priority values can be obtained with respect to different α values, which reflect the cooks’ attitude toward the reliability of the information provided by the five customers. Such a change from the cooks’ attitude may play the following two roles in QFD. Firstly, our research context is the first step of the four-stage QFD, the priority information will be transferred to the second stage. Therefore, the priority information under different α values will inevitably influence the second stage. Secondly, in practice it is not so easy for the cooks to pay attention to all the important HOWs. Under their attitude α, they can choose the most important DRs by specifying a threshold value B 
                        (Vanegas and Labib, 2001). In this case, the number of important DRs may be different with respect to α. Setting B = 0.5 as an example, the priority rankings of important DRs under different α values are shown in Table 7
                        , which shows that the number of important DRs (HOWs) increases with the cooks’ attitudinal character α.

Finally, given an α value a consensus degree can be obtained according to Eqs. (15)–(18). To clearly show the relationship between the consensus degree and an α value, the consensus degrees with respect to different α values are depicted in Fig. 3
                        (a), which shows that the greater value the α, the higher consensus degree, i.e., the consensus degree is monotonically non-decreasing with α.

The example discussing the basic HOWS (DRs) of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS; Khoo and Ho, 1996; Chen et al., 2006; Kwong et al., 2011; Wang, 2012) is also applied here to illustrate the idea proposed. In that example, 8 major WHATs (CRs) are identified in a survey market for the design of the FMS, which are “CR1: High production volume”, “CR2: Short setup time”, “CR3: Load-carrying capacity”, “CR4: User-friendliness”, “CR5: Associated functions”, “CR6: Modularity”, “CR7: Wide tool variety”, and “CR8: Wide product variety”. Then, 10 surveyed customers are asked to assess the eight CRs by making use the following linguistic variable

Their importance assessments are shown in Table 8
                        (indexed by “Importance ratings”) where, for example, customer 1 rates the relative importance of CR1 as “VI (Very important)”.


Based on the design team’s experience and expert knowledge, 10 HOWs (DRs) are identified responding to the eight major CRs, which are “DR1: Automatic gauging”, “DR2: Tool change system”, “DR3: Tool monitoring system”, “DR4: Coordinate measuring machine”, “DR5: Automated guided vehicle”, “DR6: Conveyor”, “DR7: Programmable logic controller”, “DR8: Storage and retrieval system”, “DR9: Modular fixture”, and “DR10: Robots”. According to the customers, the design team needs to translate the customers’ wishes into technical specifications from the DRs. These requirements must be in balance with available expertise and the given time and cost frame of the project. Consequently, the design team needs to determine the priorities of the DRs in developing a new model of an FMS and to provide an objective means of assuring that requirements have been met. The relationship measure between CRs and DRs are assessed by the QFD design team with the following linguistic variable

                        Table 8 (indexed by “Relationships between CRs and DRs”) shows the linguistic relationship matrix between the eight CRs and the 10 DRs assessed by the QFD design team where, for example, the design team considers the relationship between DR1 and CR1 as “M (Moderate)”.

The application procedure of our proposed approach to this FMS example is the same as the one to the restaurant example, therefore we here only give the final results of this FMS example. Table 9
                        shows different priority information of the 10 HOWS (DRs) under different α values, which has similar properties with the restaurant example. As a default recommendation to the design team, priority ranking of the 10 DRs is DR3≻DR7≻DR1≻DR2≻DR4≻DR8≻DR9≻DR10≻DR6≻DR5.

Finally, we consider the consensus degree in this FMS example. The consensus degrees with respect to different α values are depicted in Fig. 3(b), which has similar properties with the one (Fig. 3(a)) of the restaurant example. It is also observed from Fig. 3 that the line of this FMS example is steeper than that of the restaurant example. For example, when α = 0.4 we find

Our uncertain QFD context has been widely investigated in the literature by quantifying qualitative concepts with fuzzy sets. In this section, we compare our proposed approach with Chen et al. (2006),Kwong et al. (2011), and Wang (2012), all of which have utilized the nonlinear (fractional) programming (NLP) based FWA (NLP-FWA for short) method (Kao & Liu, 2001). Before doing so, it is necessary to give brief descriptions of these three approaches.

In their seminal work of fuzzy linguistic QFD, Chen et al. (2006) proposed a method by means of the NLP-FWA method and fuzzy expected value (FEV) operator (Liu & Liu, 2002) to rank DRs in fuzzy linguistic QFD. Their approach can be summarized as follows.

                              
                                 •
                                 Firstly, fuzzy importance weights of WHATs (CRs) and fuzzy relationships between CRs and HOWs (DRs) provided by multiple customers and QFD team members are averaged.

Secondly, the NLP-FWA method is used to determine the fuzzy weights of DRs.

Finally, the fuzzy weights of DRs are defuzzified using the FEV operator for prioritizing DRs.


                           Kwong et al. (2011) approach is a fuzzy group decision-making approach that integrates the NLP-FWA method with a consensus ordinal ranking technique, summarized as follows.

                              
                                 •
                                 Firstly, the importance weights of HOWs (DRs) with respect to each customer are determined using the NLP-FWA method.

Secondly, the FEV operator is used to defuzzify the fuzzy weights of DRs. An ordinal ranking of DRs with respect to each customer can then be generated from the defuzzification.

Finally, all customers’ preferences on the ranking of DRs are synthesized via 0-1 integer programming to achieve a consensus ranking.


                           Wang (2012) approach is a fuzzy normalization based group decision-making approach, which can be summarized as follows.

                              
                                 •
                                 Firstly, the importance weights of HOWS (DRs) with respect to each customer are determined using the NLP-FWA method.

Secondly, the importance weights of DRs with respect to different customers are normalized by the NLP-FWA method.

Finally, a defuzzification method is used to prioritize the DRs.

For more details about these three existing techniques, the readers can refer to Chen et al. (2006),Kwong et al. (2011), and Wang (2012). All of the three approaches have been implemented by means of Java programming language in this study. Moreover, in order to clearly show the main differences of these three existing approaches, the FEV operator is used to defuzzify a fuzzy value in Wang (2012) approach.

Here, the restaurant example in Section 5.1 is used as a comparison for the illustration purpose. As mentioned before, the above three existing approaches have quantified the qualitative concepts (linguistic judgments) by means of fuzzy sets. Similar with Chan and Wu (2005), the following fuzzy linguistic variables have been used to semantically represent the linguistic judgements.

                           where ( ·, ·, ·) is used to represent a triangular fuzzy number. With the linguistic judgments in Tables 2–3 and their semantically represented fuzzy numbers in Eq. (22), we can calculate the prioritization results by the three existing approaches using our Java programs, as shown in Table 10
                           . It is found that the three existing approaches generate same priority ranking as ours. Kwong et al. (2011) approach only generates a priority ranking without values, it may not be suitable since the priority values can also be transformed to the later stages.

Despite the same priority ranking generated, the above three existing approaches make use of the associated fuzzy membership function of every linguistic label, which is often defined subjectively and context dependently. Such a need to define fuzzy membership functions for the qualitative concepts may create a burden in the application of QFD, since QFD design team may not be familiar with the knowledge of fuzzy sets. Due to the difficulty to use QFD in practice (Cristiano et al., 2001), the three existing approaches need costly learning processes of fuzzy sets that could reduce the usefulness of these approaches. Instead, our approach performs computation directly with words based on the order-based semantics of linguistic labels. Consequently, the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts can be eliminated. In this sense, it gives a practical convenience in the process of QFD planning.

Even if the fuzzy membership functions can be easily learned and defined by the QFD design team, such a quantification is in fact the process of transforming an ordinal scale into a cardinal scale that represents an “arbitrary passage”, therefore it is easy to produce different results by choosing different scales from which to draw the ordinals (Han et al., 2004). Similar with Liu & Wu (2008), the following fuzzy linguistic variables can be used to quantify the qualitative concepts in our research context.

                           which is quite different from Eq. (22). With the new fuzzy membership functions defined, we can obtain the prioritization results of the nine DRs by the three existing approaches. Interestingly, the priority rankings generated by the three approaches keep the same as ours. Since Kwong et al. (2011) approach only generates a priority ranking without priority values, we only list the priority values of Chen et al. (2006) and Wang (2012) in Table 11
                           , which are quite different from the ones in Table 10. It is found that the priority values change with the definition of fuzzy membership functions. Moreover, in Chen et al. (2006) results, the priority value of DR6 differs slightly from the one of DR7, i.e., V
                           6 = 0.4748 and V
                           7 = 0.475. The same phenomenon appears in Wang (2012) results. Due to the small difference of weights between DR6 and DR7, the cooks may treat these two HOWs equivalently in practice. Since the priority values may be transformed to the later stages in QFD, quantification in terms of fuzzy sets may sometimes be dangerous.

Due to the customer heterogeneity in QFD, it is necessary to consider the group behaviors underlying the uncertain QFD problem. In order to show this phenomenon, we slightly change the original evaluation data in Table 2 as “CRI39 = Low, CRI59 = Moderate'', which means that customers 3 and 5 exchange their judgments on design requirement 9.

                           . In this case, our approach prioritizes DR6 and DR7 as DR6≻DR7, which is contrast to the priority ranking and values generated using the original data in Table 2. Such a small change reflects the customer heterogeneity. By the three existing approaches implemented with our Java programs, it is found that Kwong et al. (2011) approach generates the same priority ranking as ours, whereas Chen et al. (2006) and Wang (2012) approaches still generate the same priority ranking as the one using the original data in Table 2. In this sense, Kwong et al. (2011) approach can also reflect the customer heterogeneity but it does not give the priority values. Both Chen et al. (2006) and Wang (2012) approaches cannot reflect the customer heterogeneity. Moreover, the three existing approaches do not consider the concept of fuzzy majority, which is an underlying concept in group decision-making. Instead, our proposed approach considered the fuzzy majority by means of an exponential RIM quantifier, in which an attitudinal character α would be provided by the design team, as shown in Section 5.1. Our approach generated the same priority ranking but different priority values with the change of α values, which reflects the cooks’ attitudinal preference toward the customer heterogeneity. Since our context is the first step of the four-stage QFD, the priority values under different α values will inevitably influence the second stage. Motivated by Vanegas and Labib (2001), the cooks can choose different important DRs under different α values by specifying a benchmark value.

As mentioned in Section 2.2, there are other elements in a full QFD. For the completeness of this study, here we provide some considerations about them and suggest some ways to handle them in a potentially more comprehensive HOQ model. According to the HOQ model in Fig. 1, the other elements are classified into three groups: correlations among WHATs and among HOWs, planning matrix, and technical matrix. Since this paper focuses on uncertain QFD with linguistic judgments, other factors involving linguistic information are considered in this section. The elements in terms of crisp numerical representation can be easily revised and incorporated into our QFD context according to Chan and Wu (2005) procedures, and thus will not be discussed in this study.

Correlations among the HOWs are mentioned and included in many QFD studies, but are seldom incorporated into the calculation of the HOWs’ final ratings. Very few studies include or even mention the correlations among the WHATs, not to say incorporate such correlations into the calculation of the WHATs’ final ratings. One reason for these is the difficulty in obtaining the relevant data since, although they can be measured using appropriate linguistic variables, correlations among the HOWs and among the WHATs require the technicians and the customers to make a lot of pair-wise comparisons about the degrees to which the HOWs and the WHATs are inter-related. This would be tedious and difficult from the customers’ perspective, although it is possible from the technician’s side. Among the very few approaches found in the QFD literature to deal with the correlations, a noticeable one is proposed by Khoo and Ho (1996) to determine its importance rating as a liner combination of its correlations with other WHATs weighted by the WHATs’ initial importance weights. Since we focus on group approach to QFD based on the order-based semantics of linguistic labels, the potential incorporation of the correlations into our QFD context may consider linguistic aggregation.

                        where ⊗ is used to represent the linguistic aggregation operation. Since the order-based semantics of linguistic label is used in this paper, the linguistically ordinal aggregation (Yager, 2007) may be a good solution to Eq. (24).

Similarly, let R = [Rmn

                        where ⊗ is used to represent the linguistic aggregation operation, which can be the linguistically ordinal aggregation (Yager, 2007). With the new/adjusted matrices (CRI′ and R′) obtained, our QFD context can take the correlations among WHATs and among HOWs into account.

The elements in the planning matrix consist of competitors, customer competitive assessments, and goals for customer needs (CRs/WHATs). Competitors who produce similar products may be identified by the firm in a QFD context. Knowing the firm’s strengths and constraints in all aspects of a product and in comparison with its main competitors is essential for a firm if it wishes to improve its competitiveness in the relevant markets. This kind of information can be obtained by asking the customers to rate the relative performance of the firm and its competitors on each WHAT (CR). Useful ways of conducting this kind of comparison analysis are also via mailed surveys and individual interviews. Denote the firm in question by F
                        1. Suppose L − 1 competitors are identified, denoted as F
                        2, …, FL
                        . Then the K customers are requested to provide their subjective perceptions on the relative performance of these L firms’ products performance regarding the M WHATs (CRs) with a linguistic variable. Formally, the judgment matrix of the relative performance of these L firms’ products regarding the M WHATs with respect to customer k is denoted by

Performance goals on the WHATs (CRs) can be set by the firm competitively and realistically, which is a highly strategical activity involving many considerations from relevant management. Similar to Chan and Wu (2005), the goals are assumed to numerical values and normalized to [0, 1], denoted by GC = (gc1, gc2, …, gc

This step is usually conducted to perform technical competitive analysis through marketing. Although some technical parameters and know-hows of the competitors’ products cannot be easily obtained and some may even be kept confidential, the producing firm should make every effort to acquire this information and failing to do so may result in an unfavorable position of the firm in the market place. In case of extreme difficulty in obtaining the technical parameters of the competitors’ products on some HOWs, careful technical assessments should be made to give reliable scores with a linguistic variable representing the technical performance of the competitors’ products on the said HOWs. Then the QFD team is requested to provide its subjective perceptions on the relative performance of these L firms’ products regarding the N HOWs (DRs) with a linguistic variable. Formally, the linguistic judgment matrix of the technical parameter or performance score of these L firms’ products regarding the N HOWs is denoted by TP = [TP
                           ln

The use of QFD for new product design has proved to be a typical group decision-making problem and requires the active participation of customers and QFD design team. In order to achieve maximum customer satisfaction with limited organizational resources such as budget, it is essential to prioritize DRs (HOWs) reasonably so that limited resources can be optimally allocated among them. However, it is not so straightforward for the QFD design team to prioritize the DRs due to the following two types of uncertainties: one caused by human perception and another due to customer heterogeneity in product planning. Such two types of uncertainties may lead to the inaccurate and wrong ranking of the DRs. In order to simultaneously address the two types of uncertainties underlying QFD, a novel group decision-making method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the order-based semantics of linguistic information is used to derive the individual matrix of fuzzy preference relations of different DRs with respect to each customer. Secondly, the concept of fuzzy majority underlying group decision-making is used to perform the group aggregation of individual fuzzy preference relations by means of an exponential RIM quantifier. Thirdly, the fuzzy majority is also used to derive a consensus degree for the uncertain QFD problem with the exponential RIM quantifier. Two examples are borrowed from the literature to illustrate the proposed approach. It is shown that the proposed approach outperforms the existing approaches (Chen et al., 2006; Kwong et al., 2011; Wang, 2012) in terms of ease of use (the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts can be eliminated), customer heterogeneity, and the design team’s preference information α. Due to its easiness in practice, our approach can reduce the cognitive burden of QFD planning team and give a practical convenience in the process of QFD planning.

Typically, the proposed QFD approach focuses on a simply but widely used framework. Although our proposed approach is appealing and intuitively natural, some directions remain in which we must extend our proposed approach before hopefully bringing it into practical application. Firstly, as summarized by Chan and Wu (2005), a full HOQ contains as many as 18 elements. Our research framework considers only six elements. We have provided some considerations about other elements and suggest some ways to handle them in a potentially more comprehensive HOQ model in Section 6. Therefore, one possible extension is to explore the potentially more comprehensive HOQ model based on our proposed approach in greater detail. Secondly, we only consider the first stage of the QFD. We hope our proposed approach can be extended successfully to the entire four stages of the QFD. Thirdly, as a similar methodology with QFD, Kansei Engineering has been developed as a new product development methodology to “translate the technology of a consumer’s feeling and image for a product into the design elements of the product” (Nagamachi, 2002). There is a trend to incorporate the QFD into Kansei Engineering (Hartono et al., 2012). Consequently, we hope our proposed approach can be extended to Kansei Engineering.

Perhaps the biggest drawback to the proposed approach is the requirement of an additional effort in deriving the linguistic quantifier from decision-maker’s attitudinal preference, as shown in Appendix  A. However, the proposed bisection algorithm for deriving a linguistic quantifier is computerized by Java language. Since development of new information technologies (IT) appears to be revolutionizing commerce generally and product development to a considerable degree (Krishnan & Ulrich, 2001), we believe that the proposed approach with the help of IT will definitely reduce the complexity and difficulty in practice. However, the benefit of new tools to manage product knowledge and support development decision making within the extended enterprise needs to be explored in greater detail.

Any relative quantifier can be expressed as a fuzzy subset Q of the unit interval [0, 1]. In this representation for any proportion x ∈ [0, 1], Q(x) indicates the degree to which x satisfies the concept conveyed by the term Q. Yager (1996) further defined a Regular Increasing Monotone (RIM) quantifier to represent the linguistic quantifier. A fuzzy subset Q of the universe domain [0, 1] is called a RIM quantifier if

                              α = 0.5, which indicates that f(x), Q(x), α can be seen as continuous at λ = 0. The case of λ = 0 indicates that the decision-maker has a neutral attitude, the membership function of Q is Q(x) = x.

If α < 0.5, then λ > 0, f(x) is increasing, the decision-maker can be seen as pessimistic. The more closer α to 0, the bigger λ is, the more increasing extent of f(x) will be, and α will become smaller. When α → 0, then λ → +∞ and

If α > 0.5, then λ < 0, f(x) is decreasing, the decision-maker can be seen as optimistic. The more closer α to 1, the smaller λ is, the more decreasing extent of f(x) will be, and α will become smaller. When α → 1, then λ → −∞ and

From the exponential generating function and exponential RIM quantifier introduced in Eq. (A.4), it is found that different membership functions of an exponential RIM quantifier will be obtained according to the value α. Also, in order to get the membership function of a RIM quantifier with a given α, we need to calculate the value λ associated with the value α. The membership functions of the exponential RIM quantifier with respect to α = 0, 0.5, 1 are consistent with the ones derived by traditional approaches (Yager, 1988). However, when α ∈ (0, 0.5) and α ∈ (0.5, 1), it is not so straightforward to derive the membership function of the exponential RIM quantifier with a given α. Toward this end, we have developed a bisection algorithm to get the membership function of the exponential RIM quantifier Q with a given α, as shown in Algorithm 1
                     . It should be noted that λ can theoretically be any value in ( − ∞, +∞). However, by implementing the bisection algorithm with Java language, we found that λ ∈ [ − 200, 200] is efficient enough to derive the membership function of the exponential RIM quantifier Q with any α ∈ [0, 1].
