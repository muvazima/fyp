                  Security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) is an important operation function for dispatching centers of current power systems. It optimizes operating conditions of the system, while saves its security. However, SCOPF in its present form focuses on a single time interval, which is known as static SCOPF. A multi-period SCOPF model, referred to as dynamic SCOPF (DSCOPF) in this paper, is presented. It extends static SCOPF to multi-period frameworks considering the inter-temporal constraints. The proposed DSCOPF is a more practical operation function and can optimize operating conditions of the system more realistically compared to traditional SCOPF. Moreover, to solve this DSCOPF model, considering its nonlinear and non-convex behavior, a new stochastic search method is presented, which is an enhanced version of artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. The proposed enhanced ABC (EABC) has high exploration capability and can discover different areas of the solution space. Also, it is a robust algorithm and has low sensitivity with respect to the initial population. Effectiveness of the proposed EABC is extensively illustrated on various test cases.
