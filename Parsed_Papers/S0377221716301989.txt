                  As a bioterrorist anthrax attack has serious consequences, an emergency management plan that can reduce the number of casualties should be studied. However, the papers studying this area are still few. This paper proposes a model which links the disease progression, the related medical intervention actions and the logistics deployment together to help crisis managers to extract crucial insights on emergency logistics management from a strategic level standpoint. This model is a multi-period one with the consideration of the period when the patients transfer into the different disease stages, the period when the medical intervention begins and the change of the recovery rate because of the time lag between the two aforementioned periods. Our model can support the decision making process in case of a real anthrax attack and evaluate the important factors, which can have a great impact on the number of casualties.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria causing Anthrax, is classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, U.S.A.) as one of the most likely agents to be used for biological attack. It may spread across a large area, and needs a great deal of planning for the protection of the people's health. Already known as an efficient biological warfare weapon, anthrax spores become part of terrorists’ arsenals in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist's attacks, when concentrated anthrax spores were delivered by mailing postal letters containing the spores. As a result, 22 were infected and five died. Since then, the use of weaponized anthrax spores has become a major threat for the civil population (Berman & Gavious, 2007). An effective emergency management plan can obviously reduce the number of casualties and the serious consequences of an anthrax attack. Even though several studies have been made about the response to the anthrax attack from different perspectives, some crucial questions are still unanswered. Questions concerning the suitable dispensing capacity of the antibiotics distribution centers (ADC), the utilization of sensors to improve the anthrax detection ability, and the choice of patients who should get the medical help first need, among others, need to be addressed in the design of the most effective post-attack response.

This paper proposes an original modeling approach inspired by Markov decision process. It combines the progress of the anthrax disease, the medical response, and the logistic deployment choices. In particular, the approach allows us to capture dynamically the impact of different medical responses on the infected population. Dynamics are important because the time elapsed since the patient is infected till the moment he/she receives medical treatment has a major impact on the recovery rate, the survival rate and, therefore, on the number of deaths. Crisis managers need to assess how their decisions, in particular these concerning the deployment and operation of an antibiotics’ distribution network, will determine the access of infected people to medical treatment. Our model allows to estimate the number of individuals infected in different periods and the number of patients in each stage of the disease for each period. Based on this information, crisis managers can optimize the resources’ deployment for the best response. The model is flexible and can adapt to specific situations and various resource deployment scenarios. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews the related literature. Section 3 describes the background of the problem. The anthrax response model and the mathematical formulation are presented and discussed in Section 4. Section 5 reports numerical experiments assessing the potential of our approach. Conclusion and future research directions are provided in Section 6.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

This part contains a brief review of the related papers studying the response to the anthrax attack in terms of methodologies and research content. Doubtless, the three-paper series (Craft, Wein, & Wilkins, 2005; Wein & Craft, 2005; Wein, Craft, & Kaplan, 2003) constitutes one of the first and most important contributions to the field. The first paper in this series (Wein et al., 2003) considered an airborne anthrax attack and proposed a mathematical model to compare five priority policies to determine who should get the medical help first according to two criteria based on patients’ ages and their symptomatic/asymptomatic state. This model incorporated an atmospheric dispersion model, an age-dependent dose-infected model, a disease progression model, and an intervention policy model. Even though the paper takes into account the limitation of the medical treatment capacity, it does not address logistics questions such as the number and the size of the antibiotic distribution centers to deploy. The second paper in this series (Craft et al., 2005) simplified the model proposed by Wein et al. (2003) and used the number of deaths as a key parameter to analyze the response to the anthrax bioterrorist attack. The third paper (Wein & Craft, 2005) used the model proposed in the second paper to discuss four different public health intervention methods, such as the pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis.

The literature contains other important contributions to different aspects of the study of anthrax. Brookmeyer, Johnson, and Barry (2005) studied anthrax's progression focusing on the incubation period. Based on the competing risk formulations, several models were developed to number the spore clearance and germination. These models could be used to predict the length of time for which each individual will remain in each of the different disease stages. Bravata et al. (2006) evaluated the costs, cost-effectiveness and lives saved by four alternative strategies (cost–effectiveness analysis). They concluded that the local dispensing capacity is the most important factor to restrain the mortality rate in an anthrax bioterrorist attack. Hu and Zhao (2001) used system dynamics to analyze the different emergency response modes to an anthrax attack. Jamrog, Shatz, and Smith (2007) used Markov chains to model the response to the anthrax attack and, again, concluded that the antibiotic distribution capacity is a key factor to reduce causalities. Zaric et al. (2008) used the compartmental approach, which aims at reducing the population diversity to a few key characteristics relevant to the disease, to study the progress of an epidemic and the intervention policies. The model developed by Zaric et al. (2008) was used to evaluate the costs and benefits of various strategies (cost–benefit analysis). Houck and Herrmann (2011) and Herrmann (2013) extended the model in (Zaric et al., 2008) to estimate the number of casualties in the situation where authorities pre-position medications (MedKits) in individual households to be used in case of need. They run several sensibility analysis and concluded that, in all the cases, prepositioned medications strongly reduce the mortality rate. Our model adopts a similar compartmental approach, based on a network of states and a set of probabilities defining the transitions between them. However, we use linear programming to optimize medical and logistic decisions. For example, the model decides how to allocate the available treatments among the different compartments provided a given inventory replenishment policy. Also, although we do not explicitly consider the use of pre-positioned MedKits, the comportments modeling them can be added in a straightforward manner.


                     Whitworth (2006) used a discrete-event simulation approach to design and evaluate the response processes to an anthrax attack. The author's simulation model enabled evaluation of candidate points of dispensing, alternative dispensing processes, staffing plans, and traffic-management strategies. But no criterion is optimized in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only paper using discrete-event simulation to study the response to anthrax attacks.

There are other interesting papers devoted to planning the response to bioterrorist attacks, although they consider other biological agents. Bozzette et al. (2003) investigated different vaccination policies for the response to the outbreak of smallpox. Berman, Gavious, and Menezes (2012) studied a potential smallpox attack in an airport terminal, and proposed a resource allocation model to minimize the number of deaths. Murali, Ordóñez, and Dessouky (2012) studied the response to a large-scale bioterrorist attack and proposed a facility location problem to tackle it. Liu and Liang (2013) proposed a dynamic optimization model for allocation of medical resources during the outbreak of an epidemic.

To the best of our knowledge, we did not find any paper studying the response to anthrax attack using heuristics to generate a good response policy because, first, anthrax is a non-communicable disease which can be presented by a linear model and so exact method can be used to find the optimal solution; second, the response to anthrax attack should consider lot of factors (ADC, hospitals, inventory stocks, drug deliveries, etc.) and so it is a big problem, which make the use of heuristics not be a good choice. But, some researchers adopted heuristics when they study communicable disease because of the non-linear nature of disease propagation. For example, Ren, Ordóñez, and Wu (2013) presented a multi-city resource allocation model to dispense a limited amount of vaccine to minimize the total number of fatalities due to a smallpox outbreak. Heuristics has been used to solve this non-linear problem.

In short, papers studying the emergency response to an anthrax attack are few. Though these papers made great contributions to this field, some gaps need to be filled. First, most of these models failed to combine some factors which can impact their accuracy estimating the number of casualties, such as the different moments in which patients transfer into the different disease's stages, the decrease of the drugs’ efficiency as treatment is delayed, and the limitation of the logistics capacity. Second, not all the papers studying the response to the anthrax were based on real cases and consider a given emergency management plan. Third, most of the papers tried to compare the different response modes but did not pay attention to what the crisis manager can do under the current situations. In other words, the question of how to optimize the utilization of the resources based on the current situation, such as which is the best way to distribute the antibiotics effectively, did not get enough attention. These drawbacks make it difficult to put into practice the existing emergency management plans. According to Altay and Green (2006), the randomness of disasters requires a dynamic and effective solution, thus making the topic very suitable for operational research. Therefore, we propose a multi-period mathematical model, which takes into consideration the disease's dynamic and the impact of the decisions managers on the planning of a response after an anthrax attack.

In order to give the reader a general view of the situation that we intend to address, this section describes firstly the progression of the anthrax and the transitions between the different stages of the disease; secondly it presents the three phases of a response to an anonymous bioterrorist attack with anthrax; finally it describes the decisions concerning the logistics of medical help delivery.

The progression of anthrax is divided into three stages, namely, incubation (i), prodromal (p), and fulminant (u) stages, as illustrated in Fig. 1
                        . During stage i, people infected by anthrax spores have no symptoms, but patients in stage p show a spectrum of non-specific symptoms, such as fever, chill, cough and vomiting. In stage u the patients develop the symptoms abruptly, with high fever, dyspnoea, diaphoresis and shocks, or more specific and severe symptoms. We assume that all the infected individuals become symptomatic if they are not treated, and they move progressively through the prodromal and fulminant stages.

Two medical treatments are possible according to the patient's stage. Patients in stage i should receive prophylaxis antibiotics consisting of single oral antibiotic doses, either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline (Bartlett et al., 2002; Inglesby et al., 2002). Patients in stage u are admitted in intensive care unit with ventilators, and are treated with intravenous antibiotics. However, there is no clear treatment recommendation to the individuals in stage p. We therefore assumed, like in (Jamrog et al., 2007), that since the hospital admission capacity for anthrax patients is very limited, individuals in stages i and p will refer to outpatient centers to get oral antibiotics.


                        Craft et al. (2005) reported that 90 percent of infected individuals can recover if they are treated with prophylaxis during stage i, 40 percent of patients that are in stage p can recover with prophylaxis, and all patients that have reached stage u would die. However, according to Zaric et al. (2008), the prophylaxis may recover 20 percent of the patients in p stage, and, in the best case, 3.2 percent of stage u patients may recover. Fowler et al. (2005) denoted that only 80 percent of patients in stage i may recover after taking the prophylaxis. A treatment of antibiotics during 60 days is needed for full recovering.

Antibiotics’ efficiency decreases as the disease progresses. Therefore, if the treatment does not help the patient at an earlier stage, we assume that the disease will progress unless a more effective in-hospital treatment is provided. However, even if antibiotics can be ineffective for some patients, they modify the disease progression and, in particular, its speed. According to Holty et al. (2006), though some patients don't recover after medical treatment, the disease advancement may be slowed down, so the average stages’ length of stay are increased. In order to represent stages where patients have received medical help, and thus show longer lengths of stay, the model in Fig. 1 need to be extended as suggested by Zaric et al. (2008). The extended model will be discussed in Section 4.

Bioterrorist attacks separate into two types: attacks declared by the terrorists in advance and anonymous attacks, where the authorities are not informed of the attack or are informed after the attack identification by the authorities. Our work is devoted to the latter case, but our models can be easily adapted to deal with the former. As illustrated by Fig. 2
                        , authorities’ response to an anthrax bioterrorist attack can be separated into three consecutive phases, named Phase 0 to Phase 2. Each phase lasts several time periods (i.e. days).

Phase 0 covers the time from the moment in which the attack is launched to the moment in which the authorities realize it. During Phase 0, people continue their daily activities as usual, visiting the seat of the attack. Consequently, more and more people get infected. Since authorities are unaware of the attack, no medical help is delivered until the disease causes several deaths, leading the medical authorities to identify anthrax as the cause of deaths. At time td authorities become aware of the anthrax outbreak and phase 1 begins. During Phase 1, infected patients are diagnosed and medical help can be provided. The deployment of medical resources starts. Authorities try to locate the site of the attack to lock it down but, until that moment, more people become infected. Phase 2 begins at time tc when the authorities identify and isolate the seat of anthrax attack. The length of Phase 0 depends on the available technology (i.e. a network of sensors) and the ability of physicians to discern the threat of anthrax among the symptoms of the first patients arriving to hospitals. Phase 1′s length depends on the efficiency of authorities to track-back infected people paths and to identify common locations. The model proposed in this paper is very flexible, and it can consider a two-phase scenario by making 
                           
                              
                                 t
                                 c
                              
                              =
                              
                                 t
                                 d
                              
                           
                         (instantaneous location of the attack site).

The distribution of antibiotics is managed both at national and local levels. At the national level, national strategic stocks are supposed to supply the antibiotics distributions centers (ADC), pharmacies and hospitals with the necessary amount of oral antibiotics and intravenous antibiotics. Very little information is available concerning strategic stock quantities and locations. For instance, in France authorities claim that every potentially infected area in the French metropolitan, is assured to have antibiotics delivered to the relevant ADCs, pharmacies and hospitals within 24 hours. We will therefore focus on the decisions concerning the local level decision in the infected region. At the local level, a complex network delivering both services (diagnose) and products (antibiotics) needs to be deployed as soon as possible. Oral antibiotics may be delivered at ADCs deployed to respond to the attack, and/or at regular pharmacies. Before the antibiotics are delivered from the national stocks, each ADC and/or regular pharmacies may have some antibiotics in stock but in insufficient quantities for the crisis. Individuals can be also diagnosed by their general practitioners and then be referred to a pharmacy where the treatment will be delivered. But we should not rely on the capacity of pharmacies because their priority is to ensure their usual activities. Therefore, pharmacies are not taken into account in our model. We thus assume ADCs as the only providers of oral antibiotics.

The purpose of our model was not to address all the questions related to the design and management of an antibiotics distribution network, but to assess the potential and the generality of our approach. This is why we limited the scope of our model to several logistic-related choices. Nonetheless, the model is able to respond or to give insights to important questions as the following. First, how he available antibiotics should be distributed? Since both incubation and prodromal stages’ patients will need antibiotics, who should get medical help first? Furthermore, if patients have been in the same disease stage for different lengths, who should get the medical help first? Second, what delivery strategies should be used to dispense the antibiotics? Third, what is the reasonable dispensing capacity for ADCs? Can the pre-stock of some antibiotics in each ADC reduce the number of deaths? How will the dispensing capacity impact the number of the deaths? Fourth, if the dispensing capacity is increased, would the strategic national stockpile be enough? Fifth, how will the early response action affect the number of the deaths? How will the early action of cordoning off the anthrax attack site, affects the number of the deaths? What's the impact of reducing the delay between the attack detection and the site closure, on the number of casualties? Last, some methodological questions need to be raised. For example, most authors use the lognormal distribution or the exponential distribution to simulate the development of the anthrax. Will the choice of one or another probability distribution affect the aforementioned logistic decisions? If yes, how? The answers to the first two questions can be found by running the proposed model and observe the results because it decides the number of antibiotics to assign to each group of patients (i.e. patients in the same stage). A simple iterative process can answer the rest of the questions: the model's parameters (dispensing capacity, period of attack detection, period of cordoning off the attack site…) are modified and then the model is solved. The process is repeated until a performance satisfying the decision maker will be reached. Experimental design technics might be used to optimize the process efficiency.

This section presents the anthrax response model and the related mathematical formulation. We first present an extended compartmental model and discuss the transitions between its stages. Then, a discrete-time mathematical formulation aiming at minimizing the number of deaths caused by an airborne anthrax bioterrorist attack under limited medical resources is presented.

Inspired by by Zaric et al. (2008), Fig. 3
                         presents a compartmental model which takes explicitly into account potential medical interventions. The model consists of a set of nodes (the disease stages under different medical treatment situations) and oriented arcs (possible transitions between the stages). Stages are noted by  ab
                        , where a denotes the current stage of the individual, and b indicates the stage in which the patient started to receive medical treatment (if applies). In short, this model identifies the present stage of a patient, but also keeps track of his/her “history” because the precise stage in which he/she started to receive treatment impacts the probability of recovery. Note that there is no arc between nodes pi
                         and r because we assume that if a patient cannot recover as soon as the medical treatment begins, he/she won't recover unless he/she receives a more effective treatment.

The model can be applied to the three response phases (Fig. 2) by doing slight modifications on the probabilities affecting the transition arcs as follows. During Phase 0, only stages in the left part of the model depicted in Fig. 3 (under title No medical treatment) are allowed. Other transitions between these stages and those in the right part of the model (under title Medical treatment) are forbidden, so they have probability equal to zero. The model in Fig. 3 also applies to response Phase 2, by forbidding the arc between Non-Infected people and node i.

As we will explain in the next subsections, the model underlies a discrete-time, multiperiod mathematical formulation where the number of individuals at each stage and time period is approximated by a flow model with time-dependent parameters based on the computation of probabilities with either lognormal or exponential distribution function.

The length of stay of an individual in a given stage is a random variable, modeled by a probability distribution function. Since the number of individuals in each stage is rather high, transition probabilities between stages will be simply approximated by transition rates. We assume that the development of the disease (with or without medical intervention) is a stochastic Markov process, meaning that the transition probability between two stages depends on the time that the patient has spent in the current stage. Finally, we assume the patients cannot pass two disease stages during one period. The model considers that transfers between stages of the network are done at the end of discrete periods, and medical decisions (delivery and administration of antibiotics) are done at the beginning of periods. In other words, the individuals who are in a given stage at the beginning of period t may evolve to the following stage at the beginning of period 
                           
                              t
                              +
                              1
                           
                         according to the medical decisions taken at the beginning of period t. Since the model assumes that an individual can only transfer to other stages once per period, the earliest periods when the patients get into i,  p and u stages are periods 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              1
                           
                        , 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              2
                           
                        , and 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              3
                           
                        , respectively. Also, the earliest death may only happen in period 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              4
                           
                        . Without loose of generality, we assume that if a patient receives antibiotics at the beginning of period t, and antibiotics are efficient on him/her, this patient will move to stage r at the beginning of period 
                           
                              t
                              +
                              1
                           
                         even if in practice, he/she will need some time to physically recover. Finally, the model assumes that a full dose of antibiotics is delivered to each treated patient, but this assumption can be easily removed.


                        Fig. 4
                         presents the flow transitions among stages ii, pi
                         and ui
                         from period 1 to period 4 as an example to explain the anthrax progression model with medical interventions dynamically. In Fig. 4, s denotes the period when the patients enter into the i, p and u stage respectively. This figure allows us to represent the different approximated values of the transition probability between stages. The dash line arrows present the transition between the different stages. The solid line arrows denote the individuals who stay in the same stage between two adjacent time periods. The stage transitions of individuals who get into the stage pi
                         at the beginning of period 3 are used as an example to introduce the flows of the mathematical model. The number of patients who get into the stage pi
                         at the beginning of period 3 can be calculated as the number of patients who get into stage ii
                         at the beginning of periods 1 or 2 and transfer into stage pi
                         at the beginning of period 3. At the beginning of period 4, some of the individuals who get into the stage pi
                         at the beginning of period 3 still stay in the stage pi
                        . Others from period 3 transfer into the stage ui
                         at period 4. The transitions between other stages obey the same hypotheses.

We propose a discrete time mathematical formulation of the anthrax progression model with medical interventions. Fig. 5
                         presents our model denoted by all important notations without an index of the time period. In Fig. 5, the notations on the arcs present the main parts of transitions between different stages, the notations correspond to the formulations in the following. Xa presents the number of the individuals in stage a and Ya gives the number of the individuals in stage a who get the medical help and then evolve to another stage. The notations with square outlines, present the patients who get the medical help. The notations with dotted square outlines denote the patients who recover after getting the medical help. The notations with single underlines show the transitions from stage i to the stage p. The notations with dotted lines explain the transitions from stage p to stage u. The other notations on the arcs present the patients who transfer from stage u to die.

The mathematical formulation is shown as follows:

Our model consists of two main parts: the part of development of disease taking into account different medical interventions, Eqs. (2)–(20), and the part of logistics deployment, Eqs. (21)–(32). In other words, the natural evolution of the disease is modified by the medical actions (the distribution of antibiotics to specific groups of patients) taking into account the physical availability of doses (the logistics). Notice that, since recovering likelihood is different for patients in different stages, deciding how to share the available antibiotics impacts the efficiency of the medical actions and therefore the number of causalities. These two parts are connected by variables,

                        Eq. (1) aims at minimizing the number of deaths caused by anthrax. Eqs. (2)–(19) concern individuals at different stages. Since our model assumes that the patients cannot pass two disease stages during one period, Eqs. (2)–(19) can be divided into two sets: the first period when the patient develop to the current disease stage (

                        ). Eqs. (13) and (17) are similar to Eq. (11). Eq. (20) calculate the number of dead people. Eqs. (21)–(32) concern the antibiotics’ stocks and logistics limitations. Eqs. (21) and (27) ensure that the number of patients who can get the oral or intravenous antibiotics is less than the distribution capacity or treatment capacity at each ADC or hospital, respectively. Eqs. (22) and (28) set the quantity of pre-stocked oral and intravenous antibiotics at each ADC and hospital. Eqs. (23) and (29) limit that, at each ADC and hospital, the quantity of oral and intravenous antibiotics that can be received from the strategic stockpiles plus current available antibiotics is less than the storage capacity. Eqs. (24) and (30) state inventory flow conservation for oral and intravenous antibiotics, respectively. More precisely, Eqs. (24) and (30) say that the antibiotics inventory at the beginning of period t minus the number of antibiotics delivered in period t plus the quantity received from the strategic stockpiles at the beginning of period t equals the remaining inventory at the beginning of the next period t+1. Eqs. (25) and (31) ensure that the sum of patients in different stages who get the oral or intravenous antibiotics is equal to the total number of individuals who can get the oral or intravenous antibiotics in each period, respectively. Eqs. (26) and (32) present that the number of oral or intravenous treatments delivered on the horizon are lower than or equal to the national stockpile respectively. Eq. (33) explain that no patients can get the medical help before the beginning of medical intervention. We want to stress again that we assume only fulminant stage patients can get the hospital treatment. So Eq. (34) forces the value of

(34) to ensure that those p stage patients who get the oral antibiotics since iistage and cannot recover will not recover in pistage (see Fig. 4).

                         play an important role. They connect the development of disease without medical help, to medical interventions and logistics deployment (Eqs. (25) and (31)). Our mathematical formulations can be easily extended to cope with other resources, for example, hospitalization beds. It can also be adapted to represent a situation where oral antibiotics are prescribed by pharmacies instead of ADCs. The logistics costs are not taken into the consideration in the model, but financial indicators can be easily calculated.

This section illustrates how to use our model to solve the aforementioned logistics questions, but also presents some analysis assessing the sensitivity of the models’ output (number of deaths) with respect to resources’ availability and different system's parameters. Those experiments were conducted using both the exponential and the lognormal distribution to assess the impact of this choice. All the experiments were run on a workstation with 2.67gigahertz Intel(R) Xeon(R) X5650 and 64 gigabyte RAM.

A numerical base case was built by merging data obtained from the related literature and discussions with physicians and pharmacists from our research partners, one French university hospital. Our study supposes that an anonymous anthrax bioterrorist attack is launched in a closed place, a shopping center which receives more than 100 000 visits per day. Moreover, since the mall is connected to both an underground station and a railway station nearby, an even higher amount of people uses the mall to commute. All in one, our partners suggested to consider a rate of 35 000 new infected individuals per day. We believe that considering a uniform infection rate is a reasonable assumption because the most important factor impacting the infection rate is the amount of anthrax spores in the attacked place (Inglesby, 1999) which tends to be constant if we assume that the air conditioning system in the mall doesn't include specific filters. Nevertheless, our model can be easily adapted to tackle an open-air attack where the infection rate may vary in time.

After discussion with physicians and pharmacists, we also agreed to consider four ADCs, which should be able to treat around 1600 individuals per day, and three hospitals, each able to admit on average 50 affected individuals per period. It is assumed that ADCs and hospitals are able to physically receive and storage a large amount of antibiotics. Since we did not find any official information concerning the size of antibiotics’ national strategic stockpiles, we fixed arbitrarily the total number of oral and intravenous strategic stockpiles to 150 000 and 4000 full doses, respectively.

According to the data from Zaric et al. (2008) and Holty et al. (2006), the mean durations of stages i,  p,  u, ii, pi,  ui,  pp,  up, uu are 10.95, 3.80, 1.1, 10.95, 5.1, 1.10, 5.00, 1.00, 1.60 (days) respectively. As in (Fowler et al., 2005), the recovery rate of individuals receiving oral antibiotics at the beginning of the stages I and P were set to 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. Lastly, recovering rate for patients receiving intensive care in hospitals was of 0.032 (Zaric et al., 2008).

We assume that the disease stages obey the exponential distribution in our base case experiments. We set 
                           
                              t
                              d
                              =
                              
                              5
                           
                         days, 
                           
                              t
                              d
                              =
                              
                              7
                           
                         days, and we considered 70 periods, each period being one day. Two scenarios are done to evaluate how the different values of the oral antibiotics strategic stockpile affect the number of deaths.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that, most of the works in the literature assume that the recovery rate is uniform for patients in the same stage disregarding the time they have spent in it. Since we were not able to find any information about how the recovery rate decreases with time, two scenarios are proposed to evaluate how the recovery rate affects the decision making processes. One scenario assumes the recovery rate is uniform for the same stage patients and the other scenario assumes that the recovery rate decreases in a linear manner.

Three scenarios are done in our base case experiments. In the first scenario, we suppose that there is no oral antibiotics strategic stockpile during the medical intervention. In the second scenario, the recovery rates for the patients in the same stage are assumed to be uniform and the oral antibiotics strategic stockpile is available. The third scenario supposes that the recovery rate of those using oral antibiotics decreases with the increasing of stage duration and the oral antibiotics strategic stockpile is available. The following insights, but not limited to, can be drawn from our base case experiments. First, after a large-scale anonymous anthrax attack, why is the death rate of infected individuals so high even though the national stockpile is enough? Second, which patients should get the oral antibiotics help first? How do the different priority policies affect the number of deaths? Third, if the logistics capacity is limited and then the full regime antibiotics should be dispensed by several times, how many days of antibiotic doses should be prescribed for the first time? Fourth, how should our model be used to optimize the deployment of logistics?

To illustrate how our model simulates the dynamics of the disease, the number of individuals in different stages from period 1 to period 4 (before the beginning of the medical intervention), and the transitions between the different stages are reported in Table 1

                         the following transitions are performed. At the beginning of the third period, 5333 (16.7 percent) and 3055 (8.7 percent) patients infected in the first period and second period transfer into the prodromal stage respectively. Therefore, 8388 (5333+3055=8388) patients have got into the prodromal stage at the beginning of the third period. 26,612 (31,945−5333=26,612) and 31,945 (35,000−3055=31,945) patients infected in the first period and second period stay in the incubation stage respectively. The related periods and stages follow the same rule.

After a large-scale anonymous bioterrorist attack, it is possible that the incubation and prodromal stage patients cannot get the oral antibiotics because there is no available oral antibiotics strategic stockpile. So, the first scenario does not consider the distribution of oral antibiotics. Therefore, this unlikely scenario provides an upper bound on the number of causalities if nothing is done to limit it. The number of deaths raises up to 209 914. Fig. 6
                            depicts the evolution of patients in different stages in this scenario. From this figure, it can be found that there is a hospital surge in period 10. From period 6 to period 21, the number of fulminant stage patients is always larger than the total available admission capacity in the hospital (the admission capacity of each hospital multiplied by the number of the hospitals, is equal to 150) and so 150 fulminant stage patients are treated in the hospital per period. From period 22, the number of fulminant patients is less than total available admission capacity in the hospitals and the number of fulminant stage patients who are treated in the hospital depends on the number of fulminant patients in the current period. At the end of the medical intervention, 2676 patients have been admitted into hospitals and 86 patients recover after the hospital treatment.

Scenario two investigates the decision making processes under the uniform recover rate assumption. The strategic stockpile of the oral antibiotics and the intravenous antibiotics are 150,000 and 4000 respectively for the whole horizon. If the recovery rate is uniform for the same disease stage patients, the number of deaths is 169,362. 52,545 oral antibiotics and 2899 intravenous antibiotics are distributed to the patients. 40,638 patients recover after the treatment.

                            which investigates the patients’ priority policies. Because period 6 is the last period in which the exposed people can be infected and most of incubation stage patients get the medical help after period 10, we present the value of

                            which are equal to 0 are not presented in the table. Table 2 shows that only when the earlier infected patients have received medical help, can the latter infected patients get the medical help. It is because the earlier infected patients have higher possibility to transfer into the next disease stage in which it is more difficult to recover. So, if the recovery rate is uniform for the same disease stage patients, it is the patients who get into the current disease stage earlier that should get the medical help first.

In this scenario, the oral antibiotics recovery rates for i and p stage patients decrease linearly with the increasing duration in each disease stage. The recovery rate for later incoming patients is always higher than the earlier incoming stage patients (the recovery rate for i stage patients is higher than p stage patients and the recovery rate for p stage patients is higher than u stage patients). The recovery rate for i and p stage patients decrease by the rate of 0.05 and 0.04 per day until they reach 0.25 (0.2+0.05) and 0.04 (0+0.04) respectively ((0.8−0.2)/10.95≈0.05 and (0.2−0.032)/3.8≈0.04). Since the recovery rate, 0.032, for the U stage patients is too small, we assume this recovery rate is uniform. This scenario has 49,816,538 constraints and 55,931 decision variables. The solver takes 6.39 hours to search for the optimal solution. The used time for such a large scale problem is very common and logical (Bixby, Gregory, Lustig, Marsten, and Shanno (1992), Koberstein (2008)). The number of deaths is 178,921. 54,802 oral antibiotics and 2758 intravenous antibiotics are distributed to the patients. 31,079 patients recover after the treatment. The reason of the high death rate, the medical priority policy, the dispensing strategy and the deployment logistics, will be analyzed in the following.

The high death rate exists for two main reasons. First, the dispensing capacity of the ADCs is too limited. The total available dispensing capacity is 6400 (the dispensing capacity of each ADC multiplied by the number of the ADCs). At the beginning of medical intervention (period 5), the number of infected patients is 175,000. Only about 3.7 percent of the patients can get the oral antibiotics (6400/175,000≈0.037). Second, the length of this disease stage is short and the patients cannot get the medical help in time. For example, the patients infected at the beginning of the first period get the medical help at the beginning of the ninth period when they are still in the incubation stage. Their recovery rate has already decreased to 0.4 and some patients infected at the beginning of the first period have already developed to the prodromal stage or fulminant stage in which it is more difficult for them to recover.

The death rate given in other papers may be lower than ours because: first, the value of the medical resources dispensing capacity they use is too high, which is not true in the real life; second, they do not take into account the fact that some patients (antibiotics resistance) may not be adherent to the antibiotics and they assume the recovery rate for the patients who take the oral antibiotics during stage i is 100 percent; third, the decrease of the recovery rate with the increasing of the stage duration when the patient stays in the current disease stage has not been taken into consideration.

Note that all recovery is possible if detection is instantaneous and no antibiotics resistance is considered (i.e. the antibiotics efficiency is 100 percent), and antibiotics can be dispensed to all patients immediately. For example, if the attack site can be found immediately after the anthrax attack, on the hypothesis that people stock themselves antibiotics (Medkits, (Houck & Herrmann, 2011)) prior to the attack and people can start taking antibiotics as soon as they know there is an anthrax attack. In other words, the main reason of the high death rate is that patients cannot get the medical help in time because of the limited logistics capacity and the short disease period.

                              ). The hypothesis of a full dispensing antibiotics regime is retained. From the beginning of period 5 (when the medical intervention starts) to the beginning of period 10, the number of incubation stage patients who get medical help is equal to the total available dispensing capacity. After the medical delivery at the beginning of period 10, the number of remaining incubation stage patients without medical help is 11,450. At the end of period 10, 5599 incubation stage patients get into the prodromal stage. At the beginning of period 11, 5851 incubation stage patients and 549 prodromal stage patients get the oral antibiotics help respectively.

No incubation stage patients need the oral antibiotics help any more after period 11 and no prodromal stage patients get the oral antibiotics help before period 11. This result shows that for the patients in different stages who ask for the same medical help, if the gap of the recovery rate between these different disease stages is high, the patients in the earlier disease stage should be given medical help first (incubation stage first and then the prodromal stage patient) because the recovery rate of the patients in the earlier stage is much higher than that of patients in the later stage.

                               which are equal to 0. From period 6 to period 9, the number of patients who are infected at the beginning of period 6 and get medical help is equal to the total available dispensing capacity. At the beginning of period 9, 1215 patients infected at the beginning of period 6 do not get medical help. 372 patients infected at the beginning of period 6 get into the prodromal stage at the end of period 9. At the beginning of period 10, 843 remaining patients infected at the beginning of period 6 and 5557 patients infected at the beginning of period 5 get the medical help respectively. No patients infected at the beginning of period 6 need medical help after period 10. If the recovery rate decreases, this experiment shows that the patients who get infected later should receive medical help earlier because the longer patients stay in the current disease stage, the lower the recovery rate is. In the real life, incubation stage patients can go to ADCs easier than prodromal stage patients because incubation stage patients have better health situations. Therefore, the priority policy proposed in our paper can be logically put into practice.

The antibiotics dispensing strategy should address the following question: How many days of antibiotics should be prescribed at the first time if the logistics capacity is limited and should the full regime antibiotics be dispensed over several times. Fig. 8
                               shows the number of the incubation stage patients and the prodromal stage patients who do not receive medical help at the beginning of the different periods and the required medical resources at each period. It can be found that after period 13, no patients need the oral antibiotics help any more. Our experiment results enlighten us that if the national level of the antibiotics inventory is limited, or the antibiotics cannot be sent to each ADC from strategic stockpile in time, the patients can be given a 13-day dose of antibiotics first to control the disease progression and then given the following doses of antibiotics later. Fig. 8 shows us the information about the number of patients waiting for the oral antibiotics in the different periods. An extreme demand for the oral antibiotics will happen in period 6. And then, there will be an aggressive demand for the hospital treatment around period 10. This aggressive demand can lead to a high patient flow in hospitals. The bottleneck resources are for more physicians and pharmacists (ADC capacity) than antibiotics.

Because the recovery rates decreasing with the increasing of stage duration is closer to the real situation, all the following experiments are done, taking, into account, the decreasing of the recovery rate with the increase of the stage duration. The oral antibiotics strategic stocks are fixed to 150,000 in the following experiments to see how other factors may impact the number of deaths. 26 new experiments are presented in this section to address other logistics questions, assuming that the disease development can follow an exponential distribution or a lognormal distribution, in order to check how the different disease distributions affect the number of deaths (see the sixth logistics question in Section 3.3). In the lognormal distribution, the dispersion factor of patients in I, P and U stages are e0.713, 
                           
                              2
                           
                         and

                         respectively (Wein et al., 2003; Zaric et al., 2008).

It is difficult to evaluate the optimum dispensing capacity because the optimum dispensing capacity depends on several factors, such as the national stockpile and the transition rates among the different stages, which are hard to decide. However, the mean periods of incubation and prodromal stage of the anthrax are short, and hence, it is necessary to decide a reasonable dispensing capacity to minimize the number of deaths. Fig. 9
                            shows the number of deaths with the change of the dispensing capacity of each ADC.

Based on Fig. 9, the number of dead patients decreases significantly with the increase of distribution capacity, because the increase of the dispensing capacity of ADCs can ensure that more incubation stage patients get the oral antibiotics earlier. If the disease follows exponential or lognormal distributions, the national strategic stockpile is always enough in our experiments. So, the dispensing capacity is the threshold of minimizing the death of individuals. The number of deaths is more sensitive to the dispensing capacity under the lognormal distribution than under exponential distribution. The number of deaths will not change if each ADC does not pre-stock some antibiotics because the national stockpile can deliver the antibiotics in time. Hence, if the national stockpile can support each ADC in time, the pre-stock of the antibiotics in each ADC will not affect the number of dead individuals.

The detection ability includes two parts: one is the anthrax attack detection ability and the other is the anthrax attack site detection ability. Fig. 10
                            shows that the number of dead patients decreases when the detection ability increases. This experiment can help the decision makers to decide if it is necessary to install sensors to critical infrastructures to detect anthrax attacks. Under the exponential distribution, if the anthrax attack is detected at the beginning of period 3 and the attack site is closed at the beginning of period 7, the total number of deaths is 164,047. If the anthrax attack is detected at the beginning of period 4 and the attack site is cordoned off at the beginning of period 6, the total number of deaths is 148,587. If the anthrax attack cannot be found earlier, we can try to find the anthrax attack site and seal it off as soon as possible to reduce the causalities. Compared with the dispensing capacity, the number of deaths is more sensitive to the detection ability because our experiment is made under a large-scale anthrax attack in an enclosed area. An earlier anthrax attack detection ability can enable more infected patients to get the medical help in time and the earlier site detection ability can reduce the number of infected individual effectively. Compared between lognormal and exponential distributions, the detection ability has a bigger impact on the number of deaths if the disease follows the lognormal distribution.

Numerical experiments showed that using the exponential distribution lead always to a higher number of deaths. This is explained because, on the one hand, for small values of the independent variable (time) the cumulative distribution function grows faster and consequently the transition rates based on the exponential distribution are bigger than the lognormal distribution's ones for the same time or periods (Fig. 11
                           ). It follows that when the lognormal distribution is considered to model the transitions, patients develop to the following disease's stages slower than in the exponential case, and the dispensing capacity and detection ability will have a bigger impact on the number of deaths. On the other hand, as the independent variable (time) increases, the lognormal cumulative distribution function grows faster than the exponential one, meaning that the transitions rates for the advanced stages of the disease tend to be faster. However, for these stages, the recovery probability is very low, meaning that the likelihood of death is, in any case, very high. To sum up, it appears to us that, in all the cases, a large scale attack would require a very high dispensing antibiotics capacities, so the most effective way to reduce the number of causalities is to speed up the detection thus limiting the number of infected people.

Under a large-scale anthrax attack, the sensitivity analysis shows that the use of sensors (the increasing of the detection ability) will be the first-order improvement method to reduce the number of deaths. The second-order improvement method is the increasing of the dispensing capacity of each ADC.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper studies the logistic response to an anthrax attack based on a real situation. The model proposed in this paper can predict the different antibiotics requirements on any given day, find the reasonable dispensing capacity of ADC, decide the amount of antibiotics that should be delivered to the ADCs or to the hospitals every day, and show which patients should get the medical help first. Based on numerical experiments, two factors can decrease the number of deaths effectively: increasing the detection ability and increasing the dispensing capacity of ADCs. In case of a large scale attack, the first factor is more effective. This model can be extended to several situations easily, be applied to some other non-communicable biological agents, such as legionella pneumophila, and take different resources into consideration. In the future, our model will be extended to the human transmissible diseases such as SARS and a general model which might be used in most of the human transmissible diseases.
