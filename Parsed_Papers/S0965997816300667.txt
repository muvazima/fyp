                  This paper presents the geometrical modeling methods for braided structures overbraiding non-cylindrical prisms. This modeling method comes from the motion analysis of braiding process. The motion of strands in braiding process could be decomposed into circumferential motion, radial motion and axial motion based on the movements of carriers and take-up roller. These motions could be re-composed to form two independent surfaces: the braiding surface and helical surface, which include all information of strand movements in braiding process. Therefore, the strands could be obtained by the intersections of these two surfaces. The helical surfaces define the position of strands and the pitch while the braiding surfaces define the interlacing patterns and the outline of braids. For different braids overbraiding complicated structures, the simulated braids could be obtained by changing the braiding surfaces. Based on this theory, this paper illustrated the modeling methods for braids overbraiding prisms, which generated by extruding, sweeping, revolving and lofting respectively.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Braiding is a traditional technique normally employed for producing rope-like structures. From old natural fiber ropes to modern high-performance ropes, the braiding has extensive influences on our industries. With the development of composites, it has been extended its horizons to develop 3D complex performs that can be used in advanced fiber-reinforced composites by overbraiding a complicated mandrels, as shown in Fig. 1
                     . These complicated structures include not only the common structures like some revolting structures in Fig. 1(a) but also tubular composites in Fig. 1(b) and their combined structures in Fig. 1(c). These structures with special outlines are widely used and play important roles in aerospace and automobile industries due to their number of advantages including the high strength-to-weight ratio and the flexibility to the complicated shapes [1–3].

The complicated outlines and the existence of strand crimps increase the complexity and difficulty for the analytical and geometrical modeling. Up to now, most of relevant research works focused on the discussions about the relationships among structural parameters and the corresponding performances based on the experiments. As to the geometrical modeling, some scholars [4,5] presented the modeling methods for cylindrical structures with different braiding patterns based on different theories, while for non-cylindrical braids, there are few scholars involved in this field.

Computer-aided design together with the finite element method create powerful sophisticated tools for the modeling and analysis of complicated braids and make it possible to analyze the interactions and the distribution of stress and displacement and this analytical method has become the effective method for engineering researches. For this analytical method, the premise and base is the precise and accurate geometrical models.

This paper aims at the geometrical modeling of complicated braided structures, which could be generated by extruding, sweeping, revolving and lofting. The modeling method introduced in this paper is based on the intersection of braiding surface and helical surface using SolidWorks® as the tool. This modeling method is derived from the motions analysis of the braiding process. Therefore, in this paper, the motions of braiding process are discussed at first and two kinds of surfaces are obtained based on the decomposition and re-composition of the sub-motions. Then, the modeling method based on the intersection of surfaces is given for geometrical modeling of complicated braided structures. Based on this, the braided structures overbraiding prisms generated by extruding, sweeping, revolving and lofting are introduced respectively in details.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The relevant research works on the mathematical modeling started in the 1950’s, the initial research works analyzed the braided structures without considering the crimp. Brunnschweiler [6] was one of the first researchers to report on the mechanics of braid structures. He used idealized geometry to examine braiding angle and fiber coverage and developed a single equation incorporating the braiding angle θ, pitch parameter P, number of carriers N, widths of braiding and axial tows. Du and KO [7] developed geometric models for 3D braids using a unit cell approach. Du and Popper [8] developed a detailed model of the complex braiding process by over braiding a contoured mandrel. Zhang et al. [9] analyzed Two-dimensional-braid geometry and gave the results that cover factor depends braid angle, helical length, and braid diameter. Rawal [10,11] discussed the equations of yarn paths mapping on different structures including circular cylinder, circular cone, elliptical cone, square prism etc without considering the crimp structures.

With the deepening of the research, the crimp of braid was considered by researchers, Carey et al. [12] considered a sinusoidal trajectory to give a 2D configuration for only the undulation of the braiding yarns. Hristrov. et al. [13] studied the mechanical behavior of hybrid circular braids without a core under tensile loads and developed a predictive model of the mechanical response of the braids based on the constituent yarn characteristics and machine parameters. Lomov et al. [14,15] studied flat braids and proposed a geometrical model by giving the paths of the yarn centerlines within a predetermined unit cell. Alpyildiz [4] gave a kind of descriptive equation of braiding strands based on a series of assumptions, the theoretical models included the diamond braid, regular braid and Hercules braid. For the diamond braid, the crimp was treated as a sine curve. While for the other two kinds of structures, the equation of strand was described as a kind of piecewise function. This mehod is intuitive and useful for geometrical modeling. Based on Alpyildiz's mathematical models, Rawal [16] improved his previous work [11] by introducing the crimp structures and presented the mathematical models of yarns mapped on revolving bodies. Besides Alpyildiz's mathematical model, some researchers used differential geometrical methods to describe the strand curve and gave a total equation of braiding strands. Liao [17] presented a general mathematical method for braiding curve and built the real braided structures, while in their paper, the specific equations were not given. Wu [18] gave the mathematician models based on the discussion on the double braiding structures. Vu [19] presented a different modeling method. In their work, yarn of the rope is represented by a finite strain beam model. Among all these mathematical models, Alpyildiz's mathematical model was widely used to characterize many kinds of braided structures, while it is a kind of descriptive models. The Liao's and Wu's model are a kind of total description of the braiding strands. Both of them could reflect the spatial features of braiding strands.

The research works on the modeling methods of braided structures are simultaneous with the mathematical modeling. At early days, the crimp was also neglected when building the braiding models, especially for the complicated structures. Brunnschweiler [6] and Zhang [20] used basic unit to describe the braided structures and discussed the relationship between geometrical parameters and mechanical properties. As the development of computer aided design techniques, it become possible to build CAD models based on mathematical equations. Adanur [21] presented three-dimensional models of fabric reinforcements for composite components by using computer aided geometric design techniques, the structures included woven fabrics, braided fabrics and knitting fabrics. Two years later, Liao and Adanur [17] fouced on the geometrical modeling of braided structures and built a series of braided models of revolting bodies. The methods of this modeling were based on their mathematical equations. Alpyildiz [4] also introduced a models method of different tubular braided structure based on his mathematical equations. Rawal [16] extended Alpyildiz's models to net-shaped braids of the revolting bodies. Both of Alpyildiz and Rawal visualized their models by using Virtual Reality Modeling Language. Recently, Kyosev [22], based on Alpyildiz's mathematical models, developed an independent computer aided braid software named TexMind braider®. For all these researches, only Liao and Rawal discussed the geometrical modeling of complicated structures, while both of them mainly focused of the revolting structures which relatively easy for mathematical expressions and up to now no relevant literatures once concern the geometrical modeling of braided structures overbraiding prism generated by extruding, sweeping, revolving and lofting. Due to the increasing application of braids with non-cylindrical structures in aerospace and automotive industries, this paper presents a general modeling method for this kinds of structures which would be employed for the geometrical design and finite element analysis.

In general, a braiding machine consists of a braiding plane, yarn carriers (bobbins), braiding ring and a mandrel, as shown in Fig. 2
                     . The braiding plane supports two sets of yarn carriers rotating on a circular track, one set rotating in the clockwise direction and the other in the counterclockwise direction and during this process, they interlace with each other to form a braided structure over a mandrel. A braid ring controls the shape and dimension of the braid at the point of braiding. Finally, a take-up roller moves the mandrel at a predetermined speed.

On the braiding plane, carriers run following closed tracks. When carriers run along these tracks, on one hand, the carriers will run along a central circle and meanwhile oscillate around this circle, which form interlacement with the carriers in another direction. According to the motion of carriers, it would be reasonable to decompose the motion of carriers into two sub-motions, one is circumferential motion along the central circle and the other is the radial motion as shown in Fig. 3
                        . These two sub-motions have different meanings for the formation of braided structures. The circumferential motion is a kind of driving motion, which ensures the strands run along the central circle and make the braiding process run smoothly, while the radial motion is the characteristic motion that realizes the braiding process. For different braided structures with different braiding patterns, the frequencies of radial motions are different.

During the braiding process, the take-up roller continuously draws out the braided structures from the braiding zone to form the braided structures. The movement of take-up roller provides an axial motion to the braiding strands. The speed of axial motion depends on the speed of take-up roller and determines the pitch of braided structures.

The above analysis is based on the motions of carriers and take-up roller in braiding process. The braided structures are formed by the regular motion of these two parts. In another word, the strands are the recorder of these motions. The projection of braided strand on the cross-section of braids is similar to the track. The pith of braids is defined by the speed of carriers and take-up rollers. Therefore, the motions during braiding process would be employed to describe the modeling process.

Based on the analysis of decomposition of motions, the motion of strands is the composition of motion of carriers and take-up roller, therefore, the motion of strands could be also decomposed into circumferential motion, radial motion and axial motion. According to the position of these three sub-motions, they could be divided into motions in braiding plane including radial motion and circumferential motion and axial motion. The motions in the braiding plane are independent with each other. Both of them are simultaneous with the axial motion, thus they could compose with axial motion. The radial motion and the axial motion could compose a motion which always lies on a surface formed by sweeping the projected curve along the braiding axis, this surface is named braiding surface, as shown in Fig. 4
                        (a). The circumferential motion and the axial motion could compose a motion with always lies on a surface formed by helically sweeping a radius along the braiding axis, as shown in Fig. 4(b). This surface is named helical surface. The braiding surface and the helical surface include all motions of strands, so the strand could be obtained by the intersection of these two surfaces.

Braid overbraiding a cylinder is the basic braided structure, the cross-section of which would not be changed along the braiding axis. Therefore, this kind of modeling method is introduced at first as the base of complicated structures.

In order to obtain the geometry of the braided strands, it is necessary to make the following assumptions, which would also be available for the other modeling structures in this paper:

                           
                              •
                              The projections of strands on the cross-section of braid is represented rose curves.

The strands in the same direction are of the same morphology, the difference only lies on the initial positions.

The projected curves of strands in different directions are of the opposite phases.

The structures of braids totally depend on the braiding curve, there are no relevant interaction and deformation among adjacent strands.

Diamond braid is the simplest braid that is formed by strands in two directions interlacing with each other one by one. For one strand, it could be obtained by the intersection of braiding surface and helical surface. Projected curves are the key factor to model the braided structures. The projected curve is a kind of generalized rose curve, the equation is shown as Eq. (1)

where the R is the diameter of the central circle, A is the amplitude of the crimps and the N is the number of crimps in a circle; λ is employed to characterize the direction of lay, for anti-clockwise, λ = 1 and for a clockwise, λ = −1;φ is introduced as the starting point.

The braiding surface could be obtained by sweeping the projected curve along the braiding axis as shown in Fig. 4(a). In SolidWorks®, the “swept surface” tool was employed to realize this step, the profile is the projected curve in the horizontal plane and the path is the braiding axis. Sweep the profile following the path to form the braiding surface.

The helical surface could be obtained by helically sweeping the radius of braided structures along the braiding axis, as shown in Fig. 4(b). In SolidWorks®, the “swept surface” tool was employed to realize it. The profile is a segment in the horizontal plane and the path is the axis. Twist the profile along the path to form the helical surface. The pitch of the helical surface defines the pitch of the strands.

The intersection of the braiding surface and the helical surface would be the curve of braiding strand. In SolidWorks®, the tool named “intersection curve” is employed to obtain the intersection line of two surfaces, shown in Fig. 5
                        (a) and (b). The intersection curve is of all characteristics of these two surfaces. Once obtaining the braiding curve, the strand could be realized by sweeping the cross-section along the braiding curve. The cross-section of the strands is not confined by the modeling methods and could be circle, ellipse polygon or other closed curves. The braiding angle of strands totally depends on the pitch of helical surface and the pitch of the helical surface could be conveniently adjusted by changing the twist number or twist angle. Besides, if the helical surface is defined with variable pitch, then the braided structures with variable pitch could be obtained.

For strands in the same direction, the spatial morphology is totally same, except that there is a phase difference which would be 2π/N for diamond braid with 2N strands. Therefore, it would be possible to obtain all the other strands by circular pattern method. For strands in different direction, the phases of projected curves are opposite, so the projected curves could be obtained by revolving the projected curve by π/2N for diamond braid with 2N strands. Based on this method, all strands would be obtained and assembled to form diamond braid shown in Fig. 5(c).

From the modeling process above, it could be observed that the strand is the basic and key element for geometrical modeling of braids. It could be obtained by the intersection of helical surface and braiding surface. The braiding surface is composed by the radial motion and axial motion while the helical surface is composed by circumferential motion and axial motion. The braiding surface defines the outline and the interlacing pattern of braided structures and the helical surface defines the position and the pitch of strands. Both of these two surfaces determine the final structures from different aspects. Based on this, complicated structures could be realized by adjusting the helical surface or braiding surface.


                        Fig. 6
                        (a) is the aimed surface over which the braid would be braided. In order to obtain the braided structures, the first step is to generate the braiding surface which has the similar outline in general while has waving structures in detail as shown in Fig. 6(b). The number of waves determines the number of crimps of braiding strand in a circle; the amplitude of the wave equals to the amplitude of the strand crimps. Based on the braiding surface, the strands could be obtained by the intersections of helical surfaces as shown in Fig. 6(c). Therefore, in certain, the braiding surface could be treated as a kind of transformation of aimed surface, which could create a series of waves on the aimed surface. These waving structures would make it possible for strands in different directions interlacing while without overlapping with each other.

According to the modeling methods of non-cylindrical prism, it could be extended to extruded prims, swept prisms, revolted prims and lofted prisms. Different prisms are of unique features, which would lead to the differences in modeling process. The following sections would introduce the modeling methods respectively.

The simple extrusion mainly refer to the braided rods with polygon cross-section. As described above, the braiding surface is a kind of transformation of aimed surface as shown in Fig. 7.
                        
                     

As to this kind of braiding surface, it could be realized by extruding the projected curve along the braiding axis. The key step is to generate the projected curve. From the analysis mentioned above, the modeling process, in fact, is also the process of the generation of two kinds of surface. As to these two surfaces, the braiding surface is the key point for the whole modeling process and it is generated by sweeping a special curve. Therefore, the realization of the projected curve would become the controlling point for this modeling process.

As shown in Fig. 8
                        , the polygon is similar with cross-section of mandrel and is corner-rounded which would be more reasonable for braided structures and for the realization of sweeping process. A sweeping surface could be obtained by helically sweeping a section along the rounded polygon. This process could be realized by the “swept surface” tool taking the polygon as the path, the sweeping section as the profile and setting the option as “twist along path”. The number of turns would be the integral multiple of the number of the polygon sides. The length of the sweeping section would be the wave amplitude of the braiding strand in braids and depend on the diameter of strands. The projected curve is the projection of the outside of the helical surface and could be obtained by “convert entity” tool. The projected curve could be obtained taking the outside of the helical surface as the entity to convert on the plane of cross-section. There are also some other methods to realize the projected curve, for example, to connect relevant points of polygons using the spline.

The projected curve is the basic element for the braiding surface and the key controlling factor. Once obtaining the projected curve, the braiding surface could be obtained easily by sweeping the projected curve along the braiding axis, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The helical surface is the composition of circumferential motion and the axial motion and could be obtained by helically sweeping the radius along the axial, here, the length of the radius could be a little longer than the radius of the braided structures so that the helical surface could intersect with the braiding surface. The helical angle could be the same with the braiding angle. The position of the sweeping radius determines the position of strands.

Because the braided strand is the composition of axial motion, circumferential motion and the axial motion and these three motions could compose two kinds of surfaces which includ all information of braiding process, thus, the central line of the braiding strand could be obtained by the intersection of braiding surface and helical surface. In SolidWorks®, the intersection could be realized by “intersection curve” tool by taking the braiding surface and the helical surface as the interlacing entities, shown Fig. 9
                        . Based on the central line of strands, the braided strand could be obtained by sweeping the cross-section of the strand along the braiding curve.

All strands in the same direction lie on the same braiding surface, while the differences are that they lie on different helical surfaces and the initial positions of the helical surfaces define the positions of strands. For braided structures overbraiding polygonal prism, the strands in the same direction taking clockwise as example, are of a phase difference among adjacent strands. For polygon of M side with N wave along each side, the phase difference would be 2π/MN. Based on this phase difference, strands on one side could be generated by changing the initial position of helical surfaces as shown in Fig. 10
                        (a). The strands on other sides could be obtained by circle patterns tool, the strands on other sides could be obtained by circle patterns tool. The number of pattern is the same with the side number of polygon. All strand would be evenly arranged around the braiding axis.

For strand in different directions, besides the helical direction, the projected curve are also different. The phase of projected curve of strands between clockwise and anti-clockwise are opposite. So once the projected curve in clockwise is obtained, the projected curve in anti-clockwise could be obtained by adjusting the phase as shown in Fig. 10(b).


                        Fig. 11
                        (a) is the braided structure overbraiding a pentagonal cylinder; the quadrilateral braided structure could also be simulated following the modeling process mentioned above, shown in Fig. 11(b). The main difference lies on the braiding surface. For quadrilateral braided structure, the braiding surface is a kind of quadrilateral surface with waves and is similar with the quadrilateral cylinder. In manufacturers, the mandrel with quadrilateral cylinder could be used to manufacture this kind of structures.

Besides the simple braids overbraiding a polygon prism, complicated polygon prism would be more widely used in industries. For braided structure overbraiding the axisymmetric mandrel as shown in Fig. 1(a), the modeling method would be different and the difference mainly reflects on the generation of braiding surface. For simple extrusion, the projected curve could be obtained by sweeping a section along a circle or polygon. In the axial direction, the projected curve could not be changed. For structures shown in Fig. 12
                           , the cross-section would change in axial direction. In order to ensure the projected curve change along the axis, the modeling method of projected curve would be improved and the projected curve is obtained by connecting the points of two polygons.

At first, draw two similar polygons, which describe the outline of the cross-section of the rod. The gap between them is the amplitude of the crimp of projected curve. Then, these two polygons are equally divided by distributed lines around the central point of the polygon. The projected curve could be obtained by connecting the intersections of polygon and line in the manner as shown in Fig. 12(a). The number of the lines depends on the number of the crimps or the strands in braiding structures. If the number of the crimps is 2N, then there would be N lines employed to divide the polygon and the number of the strands would be N. For braiding surface in different directions, the braiding curves have an opposite phases which could be realized by changing the connecting manner.

Because the cross-section would be changed in the axis direction, it is necessary to use the guidelines to control this kind of variation. One of the guideline is the generatrice of the aimed surface and the other is a copy of this generatrice on the plane where the generatrice and the braiding axis lie on. In order to make the projected curve changing with the guidelines, it is necessary to use “make pierce” tool to define the two similar polygon and the two guidelines. Then, the braiding surface could be generated by sweeping the projected curve along the braiding axis controlled by the guidelines, as shown in Fig. 13
                           (b).

Once obtaining the braiding surface, the braided structures overbraiding the axisymmetric structure would be generated by the intersecting method mentioned above. From the modeling process, it could be observed that the most obvious characteristic is that the cross-section changing with the axis. As the solution, the two polygons are employed to generate the projected curve and the guideline would be used to ensure the cross-section change with the mandrel.

Under some conditions, the rod is not straight but a kind of non-axisymmetric structure, as shown in Fig. 1(c). These kind of special structures usually play important roles in many industries. The modeling method for this kind of structures would be similar with that mentioned above. While, due to this kind of non-axisymmetric property, there are also some differences.

For this kind of structure, it would be realized following the steps as shown in Fig. 14
                           . At first, the outline of the mandrel could be built. The central line of this mandrel is the braiding axis. The projected curve could be obtained on the cross-section of braid following the same method as that of regular polygonal prism. The braiding surface could be built by “swept surface” tool by taking the projected curve as the sweeping profile, the braiding axis as the path. The main difference is that the path is not a straight line but a curve. Due to this difference, all braiding strands could be obtained one by one instead by circle pattern method. That means it is necessary to build all helical surface in order to realize the intersections with the braiding surface. The helical surface could be realized by helically sweeping a section along the braiding axis. Therefore, the helical surfaces are also a kind of non-axisymmetric structures.

Based on the braiding surface and the helical surfaces, the strands could be obtained by the intersection methods one by one. The complete braided structures overbraiding the non-axisymmetric mandrel could be obtained by assembling strands in two directions together, shown in Fig. 14(c).Compared with the modeling process of axisymmetrical structures, the strands of non-axisymmetric structures should be simulated one by one instead by circular pattern, because every strands in this structures are unique and have different morphologies.

Braided structures generated by revolving are also widely used in projects. The modeling method for this kind of structures are similar with that mentioned above. The braiding surface should be generated at first and the strand could be obtained by intersection of braiding surface and helical surface.

Due to the changing of cross-section in axial direction, the guidelines are also needed to ensure this kind of variation. Meanwhile, the cross-sections are circle, so, the projected curve could be realized by two similar polygons just as that for sweeping structures. The difference is that for revolution, the polygon would not be divided by lines; the projected curve is obtained by connecting the midpoints and the vertex shown as Fig. 15
                        (a). For braiding curve in clockwise and anticlockwise, the connecting order is opposite to make sure that the phases are opposite.

Once obtaining the projected curve, the braiding surface could be obtained by sweeping the braiding curve along the braiding axis with two generatrices as the guild line, shown in Fig. 15(b)

The braiding surface is the most important factor within modeling process, after obtaining the braiding surface, the strand could be generated by the intersection of braiding surface and the helical surface. Due to the revolution, all strands in the same direction are of the same morphology and lie on a circle equally, so other strands could be generated by circular pattern. The finials braided structure is shown in Fig. 16
                        (c).

Among the modeling methods in CAD software, the lofting would be employed to generate complicated structures. The modeling method for braided structures generated by lofting would be introduced in this section.

Although the cross-sections of structures mentioned above are different, while the basic shape keep the same. Therefore, it would be possible to introduce the guideline to control the size of the cross-section. While for the structures generated by lofting, the basic shapes on different cross-section are not the same but a kind of gradual shapes, changing from one basic shape to another. Thus, under this condition, it is impossible to generate the braiding surface by guidelines. In order to obtain the braiding surface, lofting method is also used to generate the braiding surface, which refer to the formation of the mandrel. This section illustrates the modeling method for braided structures overbraiding a cone with a square base and a circle top shown in Fig. 17.
                        
                     

The modeling strategy is the same as other structures. As shown in Fig. 17(a) and (b), the projected curves on the base and top plane are generated respectively. For the projected curve on the top surface, due to the circle shape, the generation of the projected curve is the same with that of cylinder structures and for the projected curve on the base, it is a polygon and the same with that of extrusion. It should be noticed that the number of the crimps on these two projected curves are the same and the crimps should be one-one correspondence. The “surface loft” tool could be employed to generate the braiding surface taking these two braiding curve as the profiles shown in Fig. 17(c). During this process, it would be necessary to make sure that the points on two projected curves are corresponding with each other to avoiding that the braiding surface would be twisted.

Once obtaining the braiding surface, the braided strands could be generated by the intersection of braiding surfaces and helical surfaces. Due to the polygon structure on the based, it should be drawn all strand on one side and then the circular pattern should be employed to obtain the strands in other sides. The final braided structure is shown as Fig. 18
                        (c).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This paper presents a modeling method for braided structures overbraiding non-cylindrical prisms. This method is put out based on the analysis of the braiding motions. The whole braiding process is realized by two elements: the carriers and the take-up roller. The carriers with the strands run along two interlacing tracks on the braiding plane. Based on the trend of carrier motion, the strand movement on the braiding plane could be decomposed into radial motion and circumferential motion. When the carriers interlace with each other, the take-up roller is rolling to take the braided structures away from the braiding zone to ensure the braiding process continually. The rolling of take-up roller makes the strand have an axis motion. The axial motion would combine two different surfaces with motions on the braiding plane including the braiding surface and the helical surface to form two surfaces which would include all motion information, thus, the braiding strand could lie on these two surface at the same time, in other word, the braiding strand could be obtained by the intersection of braiding surface and helical surface.

These two surfaces have different meanings for the formation of braided structures. The braiding surface is of the similar outline with that of the mandrel and defines profile of the braided structure. From the mandrel surface to the braiding surface, it could be reasonable to treat it as a transformation that adds a series of rising and falling on the mandrel surface. These rising and falling structures could form the crimps of braided strands and provide the space for strands in another direction to pass through without overlapping with each other. Therefore, for different braided structures with different profiles, it would be available to generate the final structures by transforming the aimed surface to the braiding surface. Based on the braiding surface and the helical surface, the strands could be obtained by intersection method.

For braided structures overbraiding the polygonal prism, the cross-section could keep the same, thus, the braiding surface could be obtained by sweeping the projected curve along the braiding axis directly. While, for braided structures overbraiding prisms generated by sweeping, the cross-section would be changed along the axis, therefore, the projected curve would have to be adjusted following the outline of the mandrels. In this case, two guidelines are introduced to control the size of the projected curve along the braiding axis. As to the braided structures overbraiding the non-axisymmetric mandrels, the modeling method is the same with that of regular structures, the main difference is that all strands should be built one by one instead of using circle pattern tool. For the braid overbraiding a mandrel generated by lofting, the braiding surface is realized by lofting method, two projected curves on top and base plane are generated respectively. The lofted surface is used to generate the braiding surface.

The modeling process of different structure follow the same procedure. The differences lie on the generation of braiding surface that could be treated as a kind of transformation of the aimed surface.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

For complicated braided structures, it would be difficult to describe the curve of strands by mathematical expressions, which make it impossible to simulate based on equations, while the development of CAD techniques would make it possible to obtain the strands based on the relationships of spatial characteristics. This paper presents a modeling method for braided structures overbraiding complicated prisms based on CAD. Two kinds of surfaces are abstracted from the analysis of the strand motion and the path of the strand in braided structures could be the intersection of these two surfaces. The helical surface defines the outline of the braided structure and the crimp and the helical surface determines the position of strands and the braiding angle, therefore, different braided structure could be realized by modifying these two surfaces.

For non-cylindrical braided structures, the final structures could be realized by modifying the braiding surface. The braiding surface could be treated as the transformation of the aimed surface, which adding a series of waves on the aimed surface. These waves or crimps ensure the strands in different directions interlacing without overlapping with each other. Based on this theory, this paper presents the modeling process of braided structures overbraiding prisms generated by extruding, sweeping, revolving and lofting respectively. More attention is paid on the differences of these different structures. It would be observed that the simulated structures could well reflect the interlacing characteristics of braided structures.
