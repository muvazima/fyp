                  This paper analyzes the level and cyclicality of regulatory bank capital for asset portfolio securitizations in relation to the cyclicality of capital requirements for the underlying loan portfolio as under Basel II/III. We find that the cyclicality of capital requirements is higher for (i) asset portfolio securitizations relative to primary loan portfolios, (ii) Ratings Based Approach (RBA) relative to the Supervisory Formula Approach, (iii) given the RBA for a point-in-time rating methodology relative to a rate-and-forget rating methodology, and (iv) under the passive reinvestment rule relative to alternative rules. Capital requirements of the individual tranches reveal that the volatility of aggregated capital charges for the securitized portfolio is triggered by the most senior tranches. This is due to the fact that senior tranches are more sensitive to the macroeconomy. An empirical analysis provides evidence that current credit ratings are time-constant and that economic losses for securitizations have exceeded the required capital in the recent financial crisis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010) released a number of documents outlining future changes to the regulation of financial institutions (also known as Basel III) in order to address their failures during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The microprudential reforms proposed in these documents aim to enhance the capability of individual banks to overcome severe economic recessions. The macroprudential reforms focus on system-wide risks within the entire banking sector and their procyclical amplification over time.

The issue of procyclicality of capital regulations has been a major problem during the GFC. Since the introduction of Basel II, capital requirements of banks are linked to the actual risk exposure. The risk sensitivity of capital requirements may cause an excessive volatility of capital requirements over the business cycle. Probabilities of default (PDs) of borrowers are correlated with the economy. During economic upturns, the PDs typically decrease. Accordingly, capital requirements decrease and banks have the tendency to loosen lending standards. Vice versa, during an economic downturn, PDs increase and therefore require higher capital charges. Banks generally respond in this situation by tightening lending standards. Both effects may magnify the amplitude of the business cycle. Thus, it becomes challenging for policy makers to maintain macroeconomic stability.

It is common for commercial banks to sell asset portfolios to remote special purpose firms and become investors in these firms to retain an interest (e.g., to overcome information asymmetries between originating bank and other investors) or become a general investor in liquid securities (e.g., to comply with liquidity regulations). The sale of risk involves a capital reduction for the seller and involves a capital increase for the buyer. Little is known of the time series properties of capital in relation to securitizations relative to the capital in relation to primary loan exposures.

The paper follows a simulation approach applied by Gordy and Howells (2006) in the context of primary credit exposures. The distinction to this paper is that our paper analyzes the cyclicality of regulatory capital of asset portfolio securitizations, which is of a higher complexity as the risk is subject to (i) portfolio dynamics, (ii) tranching and (iii) a different capital regulation regime. This paper is the first in kind to analyze the level and cyclicality of regulatory bank capital for asset portfolio securitizations in relation to the cyclicality of capital requirements for the underlying loan portfolio under Basel II/III. Furthermore, we are the first to compare the volatility of the two regulatory capital approaches for securitized portfolios. As the supervisory approach which is based on ratings (i.e., the Ratings Based Approach, RBA) highly depends on the specific rating strategies, our contribution is the first in kind to analyze the volatility comparing time-constant and time-varying rating methodologies. The analysis for all cases controls for fundamental portfolio management rules. We find that the cyclicality of capital requirements is higher (i) for asset portfolio securitizations relative to primary loan portfolios, (ii) for the RBA relative to the Supervisory Formula Approach (SFA), (iii) given the RBA for a point-in-time rating methodology relative to a rate-and-forget rating methodology, and (iv) under the passive reinvestment rule relative to alternative rules. We also provide evidence how the different tranches in a securitized portfolio contribute to the overall volatility of the portfolio. Our findings in this context reinforce and complement other recent empirical investigations in literature. We find that the volatility of aggregated capital charges of the securitized portfolio is triggered by the most senior tranches. This is due to the fact that senior tranches are more sensitive to the macroeconomy. Our investigation substantiates that in particular the most senior tranches have a lower probability of staying in their current rating grades. Finally, we provide evidence based on an empirical analysis that current credit ratings are time-constant and that economic losses for securitizations have exceeded the required capital in the recent financial crisis.

Prior contributions to the literature analyze the cyclicality of regulatory capital for corporate loan portfolios.

                           Under Basel II/III, banks that have received the approval to apply the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, are allowed to use their own internal measures for key drivers of credit risk (e.g., PDs) as inputs to the regulatory capital calculation function. The regulatory capital calculation for corporate loan portfolios is based on the value-at-risk (VaR) concept. The role that over-reliance on the VaR has played in the crisis has been analyzed by various authors. As major drawbacks of the VaR-concept they find (i) dependence on historical data, (ii) normal distribution assumption neglecting tail-events, (iii) historical correlation matrix, and (iv) omitting systematic risk (see e.g., Goh, Lim, Sim, & Zhang (2012)). However, the VaR concept is the dominant measure in practice together with other information such as scenario analysis and stress testing to give a comprehensive picture of risk (compare RÃ¶sch & Scheule (2007)).

                        Koopman, Lucas, and Klaassen (2005) provide evidence of cyclical behavior in default rates for corporate loan portfolios and show in a multi-year backtest experiment that the typical impact of an increasing volatility as a result of dynamic default rates can be avoided if the model includes timely capital formation. Gordy and Howells (2006) analyze the cyclicality of regulatory capital for corporate loans and investigate the impact of mitigation mechanisms on capital volatility.

                              Gordy and Howells (2006) identify three ways to address procyclicality: (i) through-the-cycle rating methodologies, (ii) flattening the capital function in order to reduce the sensitivity of capital charges to changes in default probabilities and (iii) smoothing of the output of the internal ratings-based (IRB) capital function.

                        Drumond (2009) analyzes the relationship between bank capital requirements and business cycle fluctuations.

Several other authors propose methods to mitigate the procyclical effects of Basel II capital requirements. Borio, Furfine, and Lowe (2001) argue that the financial stability may be improved by introducing discretionary countercyclical adjustments in regulatory capital requirements. Ervin and Wilde (2001) argue that managed capital buffers directly imposed by the regulators are the best way to mitigate the procyclicality. Similar recommendations are presented by Cosandey and Wolf (2002). The authors propose two different kinds of capital buffers that mitigate the effects from procyclicality. First, constant capital buffers based on a long-term average view, smoothing out all cyclical effects. Second, anti-cyclical capital buffers that build up during economic upturns and are reduced during periods of stress. Purhonen (2002) argues that IRB curve flattening is an efficient way to mitigate the effects from procyclicality. In addition, he also proposes capital buffers, which are accumulated in economic upturns by regulatory defined principles. Heid (2007) states that a capital buffer is likely to mitigate the impact on capital volatility and it is crucial to consider the effects on banksâ lending behavior. Peura and Jokivuolle (2004) introduce a simulation-based stress test for the bankâs capital adequacy and the sufficiency of capital buffers over business cycles. Pennacchi (2005) suggests to accommodate a risk-based deposit insurance in the Basel II regulation standards in order to reduce the impact of risk-based capital requirements. Accordingly, the increasing risk of a bank during an economic downturn may be covered through higher deposit insurance premiums next to higher capital charges. Pederzoli and Torricelli (2005) develop a forecast model for time-varying capital requirements considering business cycle effects. The paper aims to preserve the risk sensitivity of the capital requirements on the one hand and dampen the procyclicality through their forecast model on the other.

Next to loan portfolios, Banks originate and invest in securitizations of such portfolios. Examples are asset-backed securities (ABSs), collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2006) develops capital adequacy rules for deposit-taking financial institutions and provides a capital relief for institutions which transfer credit risk to other investors. Capital adequacy rules are currently implemented,
                           5
                           The rules are implemented in all G20 countries and many others.
                        
                        
                           5
                         which involve two approaches to determine bank capital based on the measured financial risk of securitizations: the Ratings Based Approach (RBA) and the Supervisory Formula Approach (SFA). The RBA implies capital levels which are closely aligned to those of loans to rated corporate firms. The approach is often mandatory if agency ratings are available. The theoretical foundation of the RBA is based on Pykhtin and Dev (2002). Perraudin (2006) describes the Basel II capital rules for securitizations and analyzes the basic risk drivers of the RBA. The SFA implies capital levels which are closely aligned with the capital and provision level prior to securitization and is based on the work by Gordy and Jones (2004). Literature on both approaches is limited. RÃ¶sch and Scheule (2012) analyze capital incentives and adequacy for securitizations and find that regulatory capital may be insufficient to cover losses during economic downturns. Giaccherini and Pepe (2008) explore the two different regulatory approaches to determine regulatory capital for structured products and in addition the regulatory capital charges are compared to economic capital charges. These authors identify gaps between RBA and SFA capital requirements as well as gaps between RBA and economic capital requirements.

Risk assessment of bank loan portfolios and securitizations relies on bank-internal and external ratings provided by credit rating agencies (CRAs). Various contributions in operations research provide econometric approaches for forecasting credit risk and calculating credit risk parameters for bank-internal rating models. Crook, Edelmann, and Thomas (2007) extend the literature on statistical and operational research concepts for risk assessment and credit scoring and propose a logistic regression model as a tool for the assessment of consumer credit risk. Bellotti and Crook (2008) show that a survival analysis model may be a real alternative to the logistic regression model in particular using various macroeconomic variables as indicators in the model for predicting probabilities of defaults (PDs). Malik and Thomas (2009) provide a proportional hazard rate model to predict portfolio PDs using macroeconomic variables and present customer behavioral scores. Tong, Mues, and Thomas (2012) investigate the ability of mixed cure models for the prediction of PDs. They reinforce that survival approaches deliver at least equivalent results such as logistic regression models. The benefit of the mixture cure model is the ability to distinguish between default event and time of default. Chan and Kroese (2010) address the problem of measuring the credit risk of portfolios and in particular the probability that a portfolio suffers from large losses, using conditional Monte Carlo simulations. They apply a t-copula model allowing for the consideration of an extreme dependence among defaults. RÃ¶sch and Scheule (in press) find that a macroeconomic variable and borrower characteristics explain default probabilities and recovery rates (or LGDs) and therefore add value in forecasting probabilities of default. Also Bellotti and Crook (in press) include several macroeconomic variables for stress testings using a dynamic model of default based on comprehensive UK datasets.

Further contributions focus on the analysis of CRA ratings for loans. Pederzoli, Torricelli, and Tsomocos (2010) explore effects of different rating methodologies (point-in-time vs. through-the-cycle) in relation to procyclical effects in Basel II capital requirements. LÃ¶ffler (2005) shows that it can be more harmful to avoid frequent reversal of credit ratings than scarce monitoring of the credit quality. According to his findings the avoidance of a ârating bounceâ is an important factor for the reduction of the information content of ratings. The paper by Altman and Rijken (2004) is related to surveys that reveal that rating agencies are quite rigid and slow in adjusting their ratings. The authors show that this perception is not only driven by the through-the-cycle-methodology but also by a conservative migration policy of CRAs. Christensen, Hansen, and Lando (2004) perform a bootstrap procedure in order to evaluate the adequacy of rating transition probabilities of CRAs. Zhang, Avasarala, and Subbu (2010) provide an alternative methodology to estimate transition probabilities based on non-linear programming methods which delivers significantly better results indicated by the fact that their generated transition matrix is closer to the empirically observed rating transitions in comparison to the traditional transition matrices of CRAs which are based on Markovian and time-homogeneity assumptions. Jobst and Zenios (2005) have developed a simulation framework for a portfolio of loans and other credit instruments. They conclude that spread and interest rate risks are important for the qualities of the exposures.

Other authors analyze CRA ratings for securitizations. Heitfield (2008) shows that the uncertainty associated with ratings for high quality (i.e., low risk) structured products is likely to be much greater than the uncertainty associated with high quality corporate debt securities. This means that a AAA-rated tranche does not exhibit the same degree of credit quality as an AAA-rated bond due to possible estimation errors of parameters underlying the evaluation model of structured securities. Furthermore, the author argues that credit ratings for structured products fail to provide clear signals about the incorporated risk because of the âone-dimensionalityâ of credit ratings that cannot differentiate between sensitivities of exposures to systematic risk. Benmelech and Dlugosz (2009) find that there is a mismatch between the quality of the underlying loan portfolio and the ratings of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Bolton, Freixas, and Shapiro (2012) analyze the performance of CRA ratings and argue that so many AAA-rated structured finance products collapsed because of phenomena such as ârating shoppingâ and ârating inflationâ. Bar-Isaac and Shapiro (2013) demonstrate that structured products ratings during economic upturns are less accurate than during economic downturns.

Our paper supports the decision making of policy makers and financial institutions related to capital regulation rules under Basel II/III. The analysis of empirical data is limited for our research question: we compare asset portfolio securitizations with loan portfolios but can only observe either in empirical data. In order to describe the volatility generated by the respective capital rules (IRB, RBA, SFA), we apply Monte Carlo simulations as a popular operations research technique for portfolio modeling and forecasting. We use a Monte Carlo simulation framework for two reasons. First, available empirical data is insufficient in relation to the chosen long observation period (which we need to analyze the capital volatility of economic cycles) and in relation to missing uniform managerial portfolio strategies. Second, credit risks in loan portfolios are highly non-normally-distributed. Therefore, in order to forecast the loss distributions, we apply Monte Carlo simulations similar to popular credit portfolio models such as CreditMetrics (compare Gupton, Finger, & Bhatia, 1997). By using Monte Carlo techniques we create an approximation of the reality at the gain of important insights into scenarios as well as consequences of various combinations of management and rating strategies. Furthermore, the simulation approach allows to perform sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the most relevant input parameters of our model.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2.1 gives a brief review of the simulation study by Gordy and Howells (2006) which provides the starting point for our analysis. The study examines the degree of cyclicality in the IRB capital formula. Section 2.2 extends the model to cyclicality of asset portfolio securitizations. Section 3.1 analyzes the level and cyclicality of regulatory capital for four re-investment rules, two securitization regimes, the two approaches to calculate regulatory capital (RBA and SFA) and two rating methodologies. Section 3.2 compares the rating migration of tranches to the rating migration of loans in the reference portfolio. Furthermore, the sensitivity of tranches to the macroeconomy is analyzed. Section 4 provides an empirical analysis of the level and cyclicality of regulatory capital for securitized tranches. Section 5 summarizes the main findings and discusses prudential regulatory policy implications.

This paper follows the simulation approach introduced by Gordy and Howells (2006) in relation to corporate loan portfolios to analyze the cylicality of regulatory capital. The approach allows a thorough analysis and comparison of the various choices financial institutions face in measuring risk and calculating the required amount of capital. Based on this analysis, financial institutions and regulators may derive optimal choices and determine an optimal approach which is different to current practice.

                           An empirical analysis, which is restricted to analyze the current practice is presented in Section 4.

We start with developing a simulation engine in order to generate a set of bank portfolios and their corresponding regulatory capital requirements. Based on four different strategies of portfolio management, we investigate the volatility of the regulatory bank capital over time. The simulation length is set to 
                           
                              T
                              =
                              100
                           
                         years and is based on an additional burn-in-period of 40years to diminish the dependence of results on the starting conditions. We propose a simulation study as we analyze different re-investment rules, securitization regimes, approaches to calculate regulatory capital and rating methodologies. The simulation study is much needed as empirical data, such as the one used in Section 4 of this paper, is unable to control for the arrangements which financial institutions apply. The only exception is the evidence on the rating methodology which suggests that CRAs predominantly use a time-constant rating methodology.

The portfolio held by each bank contains

                         corporate loans which are equally-weighted with regard to the exposure but different in credit quality and remaining maturity. In the simulation, the credit risk is modeled according to a single-factor approach for the individual asset return based on Merton (1974). In this model, which is also known as the âGaussian one factor copula modelâ, the asset returns of borrowers depend on a systematic risk component and on an idiosyncratic risk component.

                           The chosen parameters are consistent with prior literature (compare e.g., Gordy & Howells, 2006) and current industry practice. Bank portfolios can be different in their geography and industry decomposition, which may cause different effects in relation to systematic risk. In practice, macroeconomic shifts do not necessarily activate changes across all banks to the same extent. In order to capture this feature, market segmentation has been introduced to the model (

The composition of credit ratings for the initial bank portfolio follows the distribution presented by Gordy (2000) for large US banks. The rating scale is classified into the following eight rating grades: âAAAâ, âAAâ, âAâ, âBBBâ, âBBâ, âBâ, âCCCâ, âDâ. D denotes the default grade.

The distribution displays a portfolio with average credit quality and is based on empirical distributions of ratings by the major credit rating agencies across these classes (compare, e.g., Moodyâs Investors Service (2012)). Defaulted or matured loans will be replaced in order to maintain an adequate portfolio size.

                           Consistent with prior literature, we assume that the reinvestments after default are funded from credit risk premiums which are based on expected future losses.

Different reinvestment mechanisms imply that loans will be originated and incorporated into the calculation of the regulatory capital of the portfolio. We differentiate between the following reinvestment rules:
                           
                              â¢

Passive replacement.

Cyclical replacement.


                                 Bassett and ZakrajÅ¡ek (2003) replacement (BZ replacement).

The simplest and most intuitive reinvestment rule is called âfixed replacementâ. This rule follows the assumption that the credit quality of a bank portfolio is relatively stable over time. All loans are therefore replaced in proportion to the initial distribution of credit ratings. Gordy and Howells (2006) present three further strategies for the bankâs portfolio management. The second rule replaces loans in proportion of the distribution of the non-defaulted loans of the portfolio at the end of time period t and is named âpassive replacementâ. The third rule is called âcyclical replacementâ and assumes that the bank lending standards are tightened during economic downturns and loosened during economic upturns. The last reinvestment rule is based on research findings of Bassett and ZakrajÅ¡ek (2003). The rule suggests the reinvestment to be a

                        -weighted average of the passive and cyclical rules and is referred to as the BZ reinvestment rule. A major result from the simulations of Gordy and Howells (2006) is that the choice of the portfolio management strategy has a significant effect on the volatility of regulatory capital.

                           In addition, other authors address lending behavior of banks with respect to the business cycles (compare Berger & Udell, 2004; Kashyap & Stein, 2004).

We assume that the default probability for the AAA corporate loan is equal to

Subsequently, the asset returns of the borrowers are compared with the computed thresholds to determine rating migrations and default events for every year of the simulation. Defaulted or matured loans are replaced according to the particular reinvestment rule. The remaining maturity

                           Note that capital requirements are only considered for one representative bank. However, capital requirements for other banks in our model are highly correlated (

The passive reinvestment rule produces the highest and the cyclical reinvestment rule the lowest capital volatility. Capital requirements under the two other reinvestment rules generate an intermediate level of volatility.

Based on the model described in Section 2.1, we now investigate the volatility of capital requirements for securitized portfolios. The paper focuses on the comparison between the volatility of capital requirements for the securitized portfolio and the volatility of the capital requirements of the underlying portfolio of corporate loans. Next to the comparison of regulatory capital requirements before and after securitization we show the results for the Ratings Based Approach and the Supervisory Formula Approach. Two different rating methodologies will be applied and analyzed for the Ratings Based Approach. In order to securitize the portfolio, we distinguish between two different securitization regimes which will be described later in this section.

In a first step, we generate the loss distribution of the reference portfolio for each year. The distribution will be used as an ex-ante forecast. We apply a Monte-Carlo simulation based on the one-factor model. The Monte-Carlo simulation involves 50,000 iterations. In every year of the simulation, 50,000 asset returns are randomly generated for each of the 2000 loans in the reference portfolio and compared with the default thresholds

                        . Due to the fact that the decomposition of credit ratings in the reference portfolio changes from year to year in dependence of the macro-economic risk factor, the shape of the loss distribution changes accordingly.

                         presents the loss distributions for two years given the current super-systematic factor. The distribution is a forecast (given the current state of the economy) which is unconditional with respect to future states of the economy. The shape of the loss distribution is mainly influenced by the realizations of the super-systematic factor. Negative super-systematic factor realizations increase the number of losses in the reference portfolio as well as the probabilities for rating downgrades. During economic downturns, the loss distribution shifts to the right tail.

In a second step, the respective loss distribution is allocated to tranches. Different tranching approaches are common in practice. In order to determine the attachment levels for the securitized portfolio, we assume that the tranches correspond to a specific probability of default (PD). Tranche PDs equal loan PDs for the same rating class. The corresponding default probabilities are taken from the migration matrix (from AAA to CCC in descending order:

Under the framework of Basel II, financial institutions may apply two different approaches to calculate the regulatory capital for structured finance products.

We distinguish between two different securitization regimes:
                           
                              â¢
                              Regime 1: we fix the one-year tranche-PDs and determine the adjusted attachment levels.

Regime 2: we fix the attachment levels and determine âimpliedâ one-year tranche-PDs.

Under Regime 1, the portfolio is annually re-securitized. Therefore, the attachment levels have to be adjusted every year and the thicknesses of the tranches change accordingly. These adjustments are determined so that the tranches reach their specified one-year target PDs every year. The attachment levels of the tranches increase during economic downturns. At the same time, the thickness of the AAA-tranche decreases. For example, in Year 5 the AAA attachment level increases from a level of 
                           
                              11.80
                              %
                           
                         in the first year to a level of 
                           
                              19.55
                              %
                           
                        . Consequentially, the thickness of the AAA-tranche decreases to 
                           
                              80.45
                              %
                           
                         from a level of 
                           
                              88.20
                              %
                           
                        . The attachment levels are lower and the thickness of AAA-tranche increases during economic upturns.

Under Regime 2, the portfolio is securitized over 10 or 100years. Attachment levels and thickness levels of the tranches are held constant until maturity while the risk of the tranches changes. Note that under Regime 2 and in the case of a 10year securitization, the PDs after Year 10 would be set to the initial target PDs.

The simulation shows that PDs in Year 5 are significantly higher for all tranches than in other years. The PD of the AAA-tranche increases from the original assessment of 0.03% to 0.49% in Year 5. Note that the attachment levels significantly increase or decrease under Regime 1 depending on the macroeconomic factor, whereas in Regime 2 (under constant attachment levels), the implied PDs of the tranches increase or decrease correspondingly. Table 2
                        , Panel A demonstrates exemplarily how the attachment levels and thicknesses of the eight tranches change over time for ten consecutive years under Regime 1 whereas Panel B presents the implied one-year PDs for the same time period under Regime 2 assuming constant attachment levels.

The change of a PD for a tranche reflects the change of the risk level of this particular tranche. Tranche risks are reflected in ratings and thus in regulatory capital. Consequently, the rating of this tranche has to be reassigned as the prior rating would no longer be appropriate. We use different ratings methodologies in order to incorporate the necessary rating adjustments in our model:
                           
                              â¢
                              Point-in-time (PIT) Rating: In either securitization regime the actual PD is used and the rating is assigned accordingly. In Regime 1, the attachment levels, and thus the thicknesses of all tranches are changing. In Regime 2, the thicknesses remain unchanged because of the fixed attachment levels but the PDs and therefore the rating classifications are changing.

Rate-and-forget (R&F): The rating determined in the first year is held constant until maturity. Capital stays constant and ratings are not monitored. This methodology produces the same results as PIT ratings in Regime 1. Under Regime 2 capital requirements stay constant until the portfolio is re-securitized.
                                    15
                                    The approach is comparable with the through-the-cycle (TTC) approach discussed in the literature but more rigorous as ratings are not revised over the course of the business cycle (as in the TTC approach) and are also not revised when new idiosyncratic information becomes available. The empirical analysis suggests that such time-constant rating methodologies are most common.
                                 
                                 
                                    15
                                 
                              

Section 4 provides evidence that CRAs adjust ratings slowly over time. This supports the view that CRAs rely on the R&F rating methodology (compare Fig. 6).

This paper assesses the level and volatility of capital requirements for the securitized portfolio in comparison to the volatility of capital requirements for the underlying portfolio. Fig. 2
                         plots the time-series of the regulatory capital requirements for the reference portfolio described in Section 2.1 and for the portfolio after securitization described in Section 2.2.

These simulation results are based on the fixed reinvestment rule. The capital requirements for the securitized portfolio are presented for the Ratings Based Approach as well as for the Supervisory Formula Approach. In Regime 1, the portfolio is re-securitized and attachment levels are newly determined every year. Mean capital requirements under the Supervisory Formula Approach increase slightly from 
                           
                              5.4
                              %
                           
                         (before securitization) to 
                           
                              6.3
                              %
                           
                         (after securitization). However, a strong alignment of capital requirements before and after securitization can be observed using the SFA. The average correlation between SFA capital requirements and capital requirements for the reference portfolio is 
                           
                              0.9991
                           
                        . Using the Rating Based Approach, the mean capital charge increases to 
                           
                              9.1
                              %
                           
                        . Furthermore, the figure clearly reveals that capital requirements for the securitized portfolio are more volatile than for the underlying portfolio. The volatility is determined by the standard deviation of capital requirements across time. Basel II capital for the underlying portfolio ranges from 3.6% to 7.6%, whereas capital under the SFA ranges from 4.2% to 9.0%. Capital under the RBA actually ranges from 5.8% to 13.8%. This suggests that capital requirements after securitization are generally higher and more cyclical in absolute terms. Capital volatility increases from 
                           
                              0.88
                              %
                           
                         before securitization to 
                           
                              1.06
                              %
                           
                         after securitization under the SFA and to 
                           
                              1.80
                              %
                           
                         under the RBA. Thus, capital requirements under the RBA have more than twice the volatility of capital requirements for the reference portfolio. In addition, volatility is much higher under the RBA relative to the higher mean capital charge after securitization. In contrast, the relative capital volatility after securitization hardly increases under the SFA.

In summary, the simulation shows that capital requirements after securitization are higher and more cyclical than capital requirements for the portfolio prior to securitization. Capital requirements under the RBA show the highest level and volatility. The interpretation of these results suggests that the cyclicality issue is more pronounced for asset portfolio securitizations than for portfolios of corporate loans.

The results shown in Fig. 2 are based on the fixed reinvestment rule. Table 1 provides an overview of the capital requirements before and after securitization under Regime 1 for all reinvestment rules.

The passive reinvestment rule generates the highest level of mean capital charge and shows the highest volatility for the reference portfolio as well as for the securitized portfolio. Under the cyclical reinvestment rule the increase of volatility after securitization is lower compared to the other reinvestment rules.
                           16
                           Note that we compare the capital before securitization with capital after securitization for the total portfolio and all tranches. Hence, we consider a bank being active as investor in asset portfolio securitizations. Banks invest in asset portfolio securitizations of other banks (e.g., to increase liquidity) or retain tranches of their own asset portfolio securitizations (e.g., to avoid information asymmetries). All assets are on the balance sheet and subject to capital charges according to the regulation. The financial system is dominated by regulated financial institutions (exceptions are currently eliminated by regulators) and bank assets are transferred from originating to investing financial institutions. This paper in essence analyzes the cyclicality of the aggregate capital of bank investors after securitization. The numbers in Table 1 present the aggregated capital requirements over all tranches.

In practice, a portfolio is typically not securitized for a single year but for longer time periods. Therefore, we now focus on Regime 2 considering a securitization period of 10years as well as 100years. Furthermore, we distinguish between the two rating methodologies PIT and R&F for the RBA and apply the fixed reinvestment rule.


                        Fig. 3
                         (top chart) plots the capital requirements over 100years under Regime 2 for the SFA and the RBA.

The figure demonstrates that imposing the described PIT-ratings results in highly cyclical capital requirements. The total mean capital increases from

                         As a consequence, banks may have an incentive (given the RBA) to choose the R&F-rating methodology in order to lower their capital charges on average over time.
                           18
                           Note that banks have to apply the RBA when agency ratings are available. Banks are paying for credit ratings and have the privilege to (i) instigate the rating process and (ii) select agencies and therefore methodologies indirectly.

                        . However, the factor strongly depends on the economic situation in the origination year.


                        Fig. 3 (bottom chart) pictures the capital requirements for a portfolio that is securitized over 10years. The mean capital charge changes every 10years when R&F-ratings are used. The figure shows that capital requirements increase from

                         prior to securitization to

                         after securitization using R&F-ratings. Implementing PIT-ratings for the securitized portfolio over 10years results in a higher mean capital of 
                           
                              11.5

                         and a volatility of 
                           
                              6.7

                        . Both values have significantly increased in comparison to the capital requirements of the reference portfolio, as well as for the portfolio after securitization using R&F-ratings. Consistent with previous findings, the bank may have an incentive to choose the R&F-rating methodology. Note also that the excess-factor is lower. In the 10-year simulation, the mean capital charge under the PIT-rating exceeds the mean capital charge under the R&F-rating by a factor of

                        Table 3
                         summarizes the mean capital charges and volatilities for the portfolio before and after securitization for the different rating methodologies and under the different reinvestment rules. The securitization over 100years using PIT-ratings leads as expected to the highest mean capital charge of 
                           
                              16.8

                        . This high mean capital charge is largely due to the extreme capital requirements of 
                           
                              100

                         during the realization of a severe macroeconomic shock. The RBA requires a complete capital funding of tranches rated B or lower. The simulations demonstrate that the sensitivity of corporate loans to the macro-economic factor is modest relative to the sensitivity of tranches to the macro-economic factor when using the RBA with PIT-ratings.

                           Note that banks may have an incentive to choose the R&F-rating under all reinvestment rules. The highest excess-factors result from the passive reinvestment rule for both, the 10 and the 100years simulation. Vice versa, the lowest excess-factor results from the cyclical reinvestment rule for both simulation periods.

Note that mean capital requirement-changes and volatility-changes under the SFA are marginal for different securitization maturities.

In order to get a better understanding of the origin of the volatility of the securitized portfolio, we now analyze the volatility of individual tranches. This subsection provides a deeper analysis and comparison of the pool and tranche properties.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the relation between the systematic risk factor, the number of defaults in the reference portfolio and capital requirements of the reference portfolio. The upper left figure indicates that the realization of a negative super-systematic risk factor increases the number of defaults in the reference portfolio. The upper right figure shows that capital requirements are highly dependent on the realization of the super-systematic factor. The lower left figure plots the relation between regulatory capital and the number of defaults in the reference portfolio. Capital requirements which are determined in time period t aim to cover losses that occur in time period

We now investigate the sensitivity of individual tranches to the macro-economic factor. Thus, we compare the capital requirements for all individual risk segments under the RBA for both rating alternatives (Regime 
                           
                              2

                         years). Table 4
                         shows the capital requirements for the first ten years of the simulation for all tranches and for the overall portfolio. Note that the ten-year period is the first subset of the 100years simulation displayed in Fig. 3. The first row in Table 4 shows the capital requirements for PIT and R&F-ratings. Capital requirements remain on the level shown in the first row due to the fact that the R&F-ratings stay the same. The figures for the following years are calculated based on the PIT-rating migration model.

The results from Table 4 highlight that the capital requirements for the high-risk tranches B, CCC and FLP require a 
                           
                              100

                         coverage for both rating methodologies. The volatility from rating migrations is triggered mainly by the most senior tranches. Table 4 suggests that using the R&F-rating may not provide a sufficient level of capital for the most senior tranches (especially for the AAA and AA-tranches). The effective risk may be much higher due to the economic factor. The PIT-rating provides an accurate reflection of the risk changes over time.


                        Table 5
                         indicates the volatility of all individual tranches for the entire period of 100years. We observe the highest volatility in absolute terms as well as in relative terms for the AAA tranche. The AA-tranche shows a modest absolute volatility figure due to the relatively low thickness but a relatively high volatility.


                        Table 6
                         shows the corresponding migration matrix. The matrix displays the migration probabilities for transitions of tranches. In the case of an impairment, the particular tranche migrates to the default class D.

The migration matrix demonstrates that the probability for an AAA-rated tranche to keep its rating is lower in relation to the probability of a corporate loan in the reference pool with an AAA rating. The probability for a corporate loan to stay in the AAA rating grade is almost twice as high as for a tranche with an AAA-rating. The same tendency can be observed for a rating downgrade of the AA-tranche. In particular, the probability to migrate from AA to BBB is significantly higher for tranches than for corporate loans. The migration probabilities for the subsequent tranches (BBB, BB, B, CCC) are closer to the migration probabilities of the underlying pool. The figures shown in Table 6 explicitly indicate that the most senior tranches AAA and AA are highly dependent on the economic risk factor.

This section provides some empirical evidence on the rating methodology applied and whether current capital requirements are sufficient to cover losses. The approach analyzes the capital volatility over time based on a panel data set on asset portfolio securitizations provided by Moodyâs credit rating agency.

                      annual tranche observations and contains characteristics of transactions and tranches, ratings of tranches as well as occurrences of impairment events. The transaction observations are categorized into the following classes: ABS (asset backed securities), CDO (collateralized debt obligations), CMBS (commercial mortgage-backed securities), HEL (home equity loans) and RMBS (residential mortgage-backed securities).


                     Fig. 5
                      shows the empirical distribution of ratings over time for all transaction types.

We consider the time period between 1998 and 2008 and calculate RBA capital requirements and default rates for each year and for all different transaction types. Fig. 6
                      shows the empirical RBA capital requirements in relation to the default rates per transaction type.

The capital requirements based on the empirical data are nearly constant over the considered time period. This indicates that the ratings of the credit rating agencies are closer to the time-constant rating methodology (such as R&F) rather than the point-in-time rating methodology. The figures also show that capital requirements for the transaction types CDO, HEL and RMBS were not sufficient to cover losses for the year 2007 and in particular for the year 2008. The capital charges increased marginally while the default rates rise rapidly from 2007 to 2008. The default rate volatilities for the transaction types CDO, HEL and RMBS (CDO: 7.47%, HEL: 9.02% and RMBS: 3.55%) are higher than the capital volatilities (CDO: 4.26%, HEL: 2.44% and RMBS: 1.49%) due to the fact that the default rates significantly increased during the last two years of the considered time period. Moreover, the relative volatilities (vol./mean) of the default rates are higher than the relative capital volatilities for all transaction types. This indicates that the capital volatility is lower than the volatility of the true risks.

This paper analyzes the level and cyclicality of regulatory bank capital for asset portfolio securitizations in relation to the cyclicality of capital requirements for the underlying loan portfolio as under Basel II/III. The paper develops a comprehensive simulation approach and analyzes four re-investment rules, two securitization regimes, two approaches to calculate regulatory capital and two rating methodologies. In addition, the analysis of an empirical data set provides feedback on the rating methodology preferred in practice and the adequacy of current capital requirements. The most important findings are as follows:

Firstly, we find that the cyclicality of capital requirements is higher for (i) asset portfolio securitizations relative to primary loan portfolios, (ii) the Ratings Based Approach relative to the Supervisory Formula Approach, (iii) given the RBA for a point-in-time rating methodology relative to a rate-and-forget rating methodology, and (iv) under the passive reinvestment rule relative to alternative rules.

Secondly, the analysis with regard to the capital requirements of the individual tranches reveal that the volatility of aggregated capital charges for the asset portfolio securitizations is triggered by the most senior tranches. This is due to the fact that senior tranches are more sensitive to the macroeconomy. Our investigation substantiates that in particular, the most senior tranches have a lower probability of staying in their current rating grades.

Thirdly, the empirical analysis provides evidence that current credit ratings are time-constant and that economic losses for securitizations have exceeded the required capital in the recent financial crisis.

As a consequence, regulators and policy makers face two challenges: firstly, capital requirements under time-constant ratings (R&F) may not provide a sufficient cover for credit losses, and secondly, ratings that include time-series characteristics of tranche risk (PIT) exacerbate the cyclicality of regulatory capital requirements. Capital requirements should be determined on the basis of the effective risk of the tranches (PIT) by rating agencies. One approach for regulators to deal with the aligned increase of the cyclicality of the regulatory capital requirements would be to implement dampening rules to the output of the RBA capital. This would be similar to several proposals in literature regarding corporate loan portfolios. Lately, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010) also followed the output oriented approach for dampening mechanisms in introducing countercyclical capital buffers for corporate loan portfolios. Main indicators in order to set up (or to reduce) the capital buffers are credit growth and GDP growth. A similar proposal could perhaps be adapted to asset portfolio securitizations. Dampening mechanisms are of exceptional importance and should be a primary field of future research due to the fact that the cyclicality of securitized portfolios is more pronounced than for corporate loan portfolios.
