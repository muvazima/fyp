                  Sensor-embedded products (SEPs) eliminate a majority of uncertainties involved in product recovery by providing item-based life-cycle information. This information includes the content of each product and component conditions, and enables the estimation of remaining useful life of the components. Once the data on the products are captured, it is possible to make optimal recovery decisions without any preliminary disassembly or inspection operations.
                  This paper presents a multi-criteria advanced repair-to-order and disassembly-to-order (ARTODTO) system for SEPs. ARTODTO system deals with products that are embedded with sensors and RFID tags. The goal of the proposed approach is to determine how to process each and every end-of-life product (EOLP) on hand to meet remaining life based product and component demands as well as recycled material demand while optimizing an aggregate objective function. Demands are met by disassembly, repair, and recycling operations. Outside component procurement option is used to eliminate the component and material backorders. A linear physical programming (LPP) model is proposed to optimize the multi-criteria ARTODTO system. The LPP approach is explained in detail and a case example is considered to illustrate its application.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Rapid technological advancements have resulted in the availability of high-tech products at low prices so that it has become economically viable for customers to satisfy their desire for newer products even before their current products reach their technological ends of lives. Increased turnover of such products have led to early disposal of goods, depletion of virgin resources and disappearance of landfills resulting in huge environmental concerns. With the increase in public awareness about environmental issues, both environmental legislations and customers have forced manufacturers to manage their end-of-life products (EOLPs) in a responsible manner. Manufacturers try to comply with customer expectations and governmental regulations by incorporating the concept of product recovery with their production models. Product recovery decreases the use of virgin resources by recovering the remaining value trapped in EOLPs, in turn, providing economic benefits by creating new markets for recycled materials, used components and remanufactured products. However, product recovery is fraught with uncertainty as the conditions of returns are not always known. These uncertainties provide major challenges in product recovery (Fleischmann et al., 1997;Gungor & Gupta, 1999; Ilgin & Gupta, 2010b).

The management of EOLPs involves cleaning, disassembly, sorting, inspecting and recovery or disposal. The recovery may take one of several forms depending on the condition of EOLPs: viz., product recovery (refurbishing, remanufacturing, repairing), component recovery (cannibalization), and material recovery (recycling). A method that has gained attention in recent years is disassembly-to-order (DTO). DTO system aims to fulfill component and material demands by cannibalizing the EOLPs.

The main objective of DTO is to determine the optimum number of EOLPs to disassemble to fulfill the demand for components and materials such that a criterion or a combination of criteria of the system is satisfied. EOLPs, however, originate from many sources in which the products are subjected to various operating environments, usage patterns and customer upgrades. This causes an unpredictable/uncertain status in EOLPs leading to errors in DTO’s outcome. Since the life cycle information of a product is unknown, inspection and testing become necessary to determine the conditions of EOLPs and their components. When a component turns out to be nonfunctional after testing, the time and effort made in disassembling and testing that component are wasted. This increases the backorders and prevents production planners from generating reliable recovery plans for the disassembly-to-order (DTO) system. Missing components also lead to unreliable recycling planning as planned number of components may not be harvested for recycling during disassembly.

Another popular recovery option is repair. EOLPs may need component replacement to be in “working order”. This option usually requires disassembly of nonfunctional components and may involve disassembly of functional components due to disassembly precedence relationships. Depending on the condition of a recovered product, it may be sold in the market as a brand new or a used product. The components’ replacement operations that need to be performed during the repair option vary widely depending on the condition of EOLPs. When there is no information available on the components’ conditions, thorough testing is needed to determine that. If an EOLP is found not suitable for repair, the time and resources spent on determining that are wasted. It is clear that out of all EOLPs on hand, finding the EOLPs with minimal recovery costs requires testing of the whole EOLP inventory. That can be very expensive. However, emerging information technology devices, such as sensors and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, can be very helpful in mitigating such uncertainty.

RFID has recently gained importance in closed loop supply chain operations, including reverse logistics, disassembly and remanufacturing, as a means of communication and data storage (Cao, Folan, Mascolo, & Browne, 2009; Zhou & Piramuthu, 2011). Although passive RFID tags are sufficient for tracking purposes, active RFID tags with embedded sensors can provide a lot more information about the usage/condition of every single object. These products are referred to as sensor embedded products (SEPs). A sensor is a device that detects and keeps a log of the changes in the value of various measures such as temperature, pressure, vibration and converts them into useful information to provide the conditions of the components. Sensor embedded products (SEPs) are manufactured with sensors implanted in them to monitor their critical components while they are in use. Sensors collect dynamic field data while the product is being used. Dynamic field data or information generated during the use of a product consist of patterns of usage, number of use cycles, run time in each use cycle, and environmental conditions. Dynamic data also include service history on inspections and, replaced and repaired parts. SEPs mitigate storage and collection of both static and dynamic data on the product. Collected data can be used to predict failures (Ilgin & Gupta, 2010a), estimate the remaining useful lives of components, and recognize missing components as the products reach their ends of lives. In addition, using the static information stored on the RFID tags, type, release date, sale date, sale location, maintenance history and scheduled part replacements of an EOLP can be acquired without any inspection or disassembly operation. Decrease in uncertainty allows better planning which in turn leads to improvements in financial and environmental goals. Furthermore, these devices enable fulfillment of remaining life based component and product demands, thus allowing customers to state minimum remaining life requirements in their orders. This also helps determine the warranty levels that can be offered to customers on recovered items. Warranty costs are directly related to the remaining lives of recovered components and customer requirements. Because of the available sensor information, orders can be prepared so that they exceed the minimum remaining life requirements as much as possible minimizing the warranty claims.

In this paper, a multiple-criteria ARTODTO model for SEPs is proposed. The problem is formulated as a linear physical programming model. A case example of a residential air-conditioner (AC) ARTODTO system with disassembly precedence relationships among components is considered to illustrate the application of the methodology.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

State of art in Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing and Product Recovery (ECMPRO) is covered by the pair of papers by Gungor and Gupta (1999) and Ilgin and Gupta (2010b). Disassembly is one of the most popular research areas in ECMPRO owing to its importance in all recovery operations. Disassembly problems have been studied under four main areas, namely, scheduling (Barba-Gutiérrez, Adenso-Díaz, & Gupta, 2008; Duta, Filip, & Popescu, 2008), sequencing (Adenso-Diaz, Garcia-Carbajal, & Gupta, 2008; Moore, Güngör, & Gupta, 2001), disassembly line (McGovern & Gupta, 2007, 2010) and disassembly-to-order. Disassembly-to-order (DTO) research provides a strong basis to this study. The goal of DTO is to determine the optimum number of EOLPs to be disassembled in order to fulfill the demand for components and materials such that some desired criteria of the system (cost minimization, profit maximization, etc.) are satisfied. Kongar and Gupta (2002, 2006, 2009a, 2009b) presented preemptive goal programming (PGP), fuzzy goal programming (FGP), linear physical programming (LPP), and multi objective TS models for the DTO problem and illustrated their implementations to various cases. Gupta, Imtanavanich, and Nakashima (2009) proposed an artificial neural network model in order to solve the DTO problem. Langella (2007) developed a multi period heuristic considering holding costs and external procurement of items. Inderfurth and Langella (2006) developed two heuristic procedures to investigate the effect of stochastic yields on the DTO system.

Remanufacturing has also been researched recently by many authors because traditional production planning approaches fall short in a product recovery setting. Lage and Godinho Filho (2011) reviewed 76 journal articles published on production planning and control (PPC) in remanufacturing between 2000 and 2009. The authors also provided a comparative analysis between this literature review and the review conducted by Guide (2000). High degrees of variability in the quantity, quality and timing of returned products necessitate innovative planning techniques that can deal with uncertainty (Schultmann, Zumkeller, & Rentz, 2006). In general, a production planning system for remanufacturing assists managers in planning how much and when to disassemble, how much and when to remanufacture, how much to produce and/or order for new materials, and coordinates disassembly and reassembly (Guide, Jayaraman, & Srivastava, 1999). Georgiadis and Athanasiou (2010) presented the impact of two-product joint lifecycles on capacity planning of remanufacturing networks. Authors put emphasis on the inherent uncertainties of remanufacturing systems and propose a systems dynamics model and design of experiments for capacity planning. A recent study by Georgiadis and Athanasiou (2013) deals with long-term demand-driven capacity planning policies in the reverse channel of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) with remanufacturing, under high capacity acquisition cost coupled with uncertainty in actual demand, sales patterns, quality and timing of end-of-use product returns. Authors study the system’s response in terms of transient flows, actual/desired capacity level, capacity expansions/contractions and total supply chain profit, employing a simulation-based system dynamics optimization approach. Kim, Song, Kim, and Jeong (2006) developed a mixed-integer programming model to maximize the remanufacturing cost savings by determining the quantity of products/parts processed in the remanufacturing facilities/subcontractors and the amount of parts procured from external sources. DePuy, Usher, Walker, and Taylor (2007) presented a production planning method which estimates the expected number of remanufactured units to be completed in each future period. This method also estimates the number of components to be purchased to avoid any projected shortages. Kumar and Chan (2010) formulated a mathematical model in which the return rate was a function of environmental factors. Developed RFID embedded model is also aimed at mapping the economical merits by easily counting returned products and transferring them to different remanufacturing centers. Xanthopoulos and Iakovou (2009) proposed a two phase production planning model which can determine how many end-of-life (EOL) products and components should be collected, disassembled, recycled, remanufactured, stored, backordered and disposed in each period considering uncertain and identically distributed quality statuses for all returned products.

Tremendous prevalence of uncertainty in disassembly and remanufacturing operations led to a number of research studies on the effect of uncertainty and value of information. Salema, Barbosa-Povoa, and Novais (2007) dealt with uncertainty with a scenario-based approach which gives a solution for the worst possible scenario. Ferrer (2003), Ferrer and Ketzenberg (2004) developed decision models to analyze a remanufacturer’s trade-off between limited information about remanufacturing yields and potentially long supplier lead times. Ketzenberg, Souza, and Guide (2003) investigated the impact of having advanced remanufacturing yield information in long-run average flow time. Ketzenberg, van der Laan, and Teunter (2006) studied the value of information in a remanufacturing setting by simultaneously considering the demand, return and yield uncertainties. Ketzenberg (2009) extended their study by considering disposal of returned products and a capacitated product recovery system. As it can be seen in the presented literature, authors developed various approaches to provide good solutions to product recovery problems under the inherent uncertainty and emerging product monitoring technologies facilitate EOL product recovery by providing life-cycle information regarding the products and their components that can potentially reduce or eliminate the uncertainties. Although there have been several studies proposing the use of embedded devices for EOL management, an advanced product recovery system incorporating life-cycle information and multiple conflicting real-life objectives is yet to be proposed. We aim to close this gap utilizing life-cycle data to eliminate preliminary disassembly and testing operations, and consider customer satisfaction with an objective metric that has not been proposed in the literature.

When RFID and sensor technologies are embedded in products, all static (bill of materials, sale date, shipping date, warranty terms, model number, etc.) and dynamic (usage patterns, working conditions, run lengths, maintenance history, removed, replaced or upgraded parts) information about EOLPs become available as soon as the EOLPs reach the recovery facility. The value of information in the context of a firm that faces uncertainty with respect to demand, product returns, recovery yield, and capacity utilization was explored by Ketzenberg (2009).

With the increasing attention drawn towards design for disassembly and strict environmental regulations such as waste electrical and electronics equipment (WEEE) in Europe, it has become mandatory to tag the disassembly instructions with the product (Vadde, Kamarthi, Gupta, & Zeid, 2008). Since the memory offered by ultra-high frequency RFID tags is large enough to include disassembly and recycling information (Luttropp & Johansson, 2010), RFID tags become prominent in environmentally conscious product recovery. In ZeroWIN (Towards Zero Waste in Industrial Networks) project also RFID technology will be investigated, designed and tested (Curran & Williams, 2012). Tags contain static information about the products, such as bill of materials, disassembly instructions and release or sale date. Although passive RFID tags are sufficient for tracking purposes, active RFID tags with embedded sensors can provide a lot more information about the usage/condition of every single object. These products are referred to as sensor embedded products (SEPs). Hence, there are several papers in literature on device embedded products and remote product monitoring concepts (Blecker & Huang, 2008; Borriello, 2005; Bose, Ngai, Teo, & Spiekermann, 2009; Coltman, Gadh, & Michael, 2008; Dai, Stroud, & Zhang, 2009; Dutta, Lee, & Whang, 2007; Huang, Wright, Molina, & Ranky, 2009; Huang, Wright, & Newman, 2009; Ilie-Zudor, Kemény, van Blommestein, Monostori, & van der Meulen, 2011; Kiritsis, Jun, & Xirouchakis, 2008; Madni, Chalasani, & Boppana, 2007; Miles, Sarma, & Williams, 2008; Ngai & Riggins, 2008; Ngai, 2010; Ngai, Moon, Riggins, & Yi, 2008; Sarma, Mickle, McFarlane, Cole, & Engels, 2009; Visich, Li, Khumawala, & Reyes, 2009; Visich, Suhong, & Khumawala, 2007). Parlikad and McFarlane (Parlikad & McFarlane, 2007) discussed how RFID based product identification technologies can be employed to provide the necessary information and showed the positive impacts on product recovery decisions. Gonnuru (2010) proposed an RFID integrated fuzzy based disassembly planning and sequencing model and showed the use of life-cycle information for optimal disassembly decisions. Ilgin and Gupta (2011) presented a quantitative assessment of the impact of SEPs on various performance measures of a kanban-controlled disassembly line using simulation analysis. Authors showed that SEPs not only provide significant reductions in the total system cost, but also increase the revenue. Authors also investigated a sensor-embedded air conditioner disassembly line with disassembly precedence relationships among components and obtained similar results (Ilgin & Gupta, 2010c).

Availability of life-cycle information brings clarity to the EOL operations and can be used to determine the remaining lives of components (Rugrungruang, 2008). Si, Wang, Hu, and Zhou (2011) provided a comprehensive literature review on remaining useful life estimation. Herzog, Marwala, and Heyns (2009) proved the advantage of using condition-based data in remaining life prediction. Ondemir and Gupta (2008) proposed a mathematical DTO model utilizing life-cycle data in order to fulfill remaining life time based component demands assuming the availability of sensor based information. The authors extended the model in order to meet the sophisticated product demands by using repair option, and presented an economic justification for establishing advanced DTO systems (Ondemir & Gupta, 2009; Ondemir, Gupta, & Nakashima, 2008).

Advanced repair-to-order and disassembly-to-order (ARTODTO) system is an order-driven component and product recovery (ODCPR) system where SEPs are put through a series of recovery operations depending on their conditions such that the demands for recovered products, components and materials are satisfied simultaneously (Fig. 1
                     ). Therefore, the ARTODTO system can be considered as an extended and intelligent version of the DTO system.

In contrast to DTO, ARTODTO system accommodates not only the disassembly but also the repair of EOLPs. Repair activities are performed to meet the demand for products and may require reusable components. This requirement creates an internal component demand. Therefore, disassembly option is utilized to recover reusable components to satisfy both internal and external component demands.

Once the EOLPs arrive at the recovery facility, all the information stored on the memory (microchip) is retrieved by a radio frequency data reader/writer. Information retrieved from each EOLP is stored in a database along with a unique identification number. This information can be shared among the parties of a manufacturing alliance (Huang, Qu, Fang, & Bramley, 2011).

The first objective of the proposed ARTODRO system is to minimize the total cost. Second objective is to minimize the number of disposed items. This objective is motivated by environmental responsibility. Third objective is material sales revenue maximization. Although this is a financial objective, it has an environmental aspect because it imposes recycling to the system. Customer’s satisfaction level maximization is the last objective. This objective forces the model to meet the component demands with superior components to decrease warranty claims.

Linear physical programming (LPP) is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tool and first introduced in Messac, Gupta, and Akbulut (1996). It defines an aggregate objective function based on the decision maker’s (DM’s) preferences and removes DM from weight allocation process. In general, MCDM approaches require precise weights assigned to the criteria by the DM. Yet, most real-life objectives exist in imprecise environment and it is very difficult to establish the correct weight vector even for a very knowledgeable DM. An incorrect weight vector may render the model totally useless. Although weight allocation is difficult, any DM has substantial knowledge about the problem and will be able to state the objectives in meaningful physical terms (e.g. total profit of $10,000 is ideal, $8000 is desirable, etc.). LPP’s built-in weight calculation algorithm (LPPW) uses the DM’s target values for each criterion to calculate a weight vector. LPP, then, uses these weights to form the objective function to be minimized.

In LPP procedure, DM also specifies the classes of objectives and constraints. There are four hard classes for constraints, and four soft classes for objectives. Hard and soft class functions for a generic objective are depicted in Figs. 2 and 3
                     
                     , respectively.

As one can see in Fig. 3, for each class there are six ranges defined for the objective functions with corresponding target values (t
                     
                        u,s
                     ), namely, ideal, desirable, tolerable, undesirable, highly undesirable and unacceptable. In LPP, each objective (g
                     
                        u
                     ) belongs to a class and the piecewise linear class function (z
                     
                        u
                     ) is minimized. This method requires a conditional programming in order to reflect piecewise linear nature. In other words, because the class function to be minimized is a different linear function for each desirability range defined on the objective, the optimization formulation must be in the following form: “IF g
                     
                        u
                      
                     is in Class s THEN minimize the linear function 
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 z
                              
                              
                                 s
                              
                              
                                 u
                              
                           
                        
                     ”.

This is, obviously, not a generic linear programming (LP) model form and cannot be solved using LP. Therefore the weighted sum of the deviations

                                          u
                                          ,
                                          s
                                       
                                       
                                          +
                                       
                                    
                                    ,
                                    
                                       
                                          d

                                          ,
                                          s
                                       
                                       
                                          -
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                      from the target values is used as the objective function. In this form, the model conforms to the requirements of LP method. It should be noted that the weights in this function are calculated with LPPW (Messac et al., 1996).


                     Ilgin and Gupta (2012) presented the state of the art in Physical Programming studies by classifying them into four major categories, namely, methodological papers (linear, fuzzy, global, interactive physical programming, and others), industrial engineering applications (forward supply chains, reverse and closed-loop supply chains, production planning, reliability and maintenance, quality function deployment), mechanical engineering applications (design and control), and other applications. Insights from the review and future research directions conclude the paper. As mentioned before, disassembly to order systems forms the basis of this study and a number of papers proposed LPP for DTO systems (Imtanavanich & Gupta, 2006a, 2006b; Kongar & Gupta, 2009b; Lambert & Gupta, 2005; Massoud & Gupta, 2010; Ondemir & Gupta, 2011).

In the proposed ARTODTO model a set of recovery operations are performed on SEPs depending on their conditions such that the demands for recovered products, components and materials are met while the system criteria are optimized. Because the ARTODTO is an ODCPR system, it is assumed that the demands are known. The necessary life cycle information is available by means of the sensors and RFID tags embedded in the EOLPs. It is also assumed that the cost of automated data retrieval is lower than the cost of labor intensive inspection and testing. In other words, savings of the new system is higher than the additional cost of it. A rigorous economic analysis for the disassembly of SEPs can be found in (Ilgin & Gupta, 2010a).

An EOLP in inventory can be disassembled for component recovery, repaired for product recovery, recycled for material recovery, disposed of or left untouched (stored). Complete disassembly is considered. In other words, if an EOLP is disassembled, then every single component is extracted. There exists a set of disassembly relationships among components and all disassembly operations are bound to it regardless of selected recovery option.

Each recovered component can be sold to fulfill component demand, reused as spare parts to repair other products for product demand fulfillment, recycled to meet material demand, disposed of, or stored. Disassembly operations may be destructive or non-destructive. It is assumed that destructive disassembly of a component renders the corresponding component nonfunctional but does not affect the functionality of other components.

Since all demands (component and product) are assumed to be based on remaining life time of the components, recovered components are categorized in different bins (life-bins) depending on their remaining life time (e.g. at least 1year, at least 2years, etc.). It should be noted that any product and/or component can be underutilized, by simply placing that item in a lower time-range bin although it is eligible for a superior one.

EOLPs contain both functional and nonfunctional (broken, zero-remaining-life) components. Broken components are disassembled destructively and require less attention. Thus, unit disassembly cost for an operable component is higher than that of a broken component.

Another recovery option is to repair EOLPs in order to meet product demand. Some components in an EOLP may be missing. Also, it is obvious that a product functions no longer than its component having the shortest remaining life. This means that reconfiguring an EOLP during repair is a way of remanufacturing products that have a certain remaining life. Thus, depending on the target product life-bin, some components in an EOLP may have a remaining-life-time deficit, and hence must be replaced.

Component demand is satisfied by recovered and procured operable components that meet certain remaining life criteria. Recovered components are obtained not only from disassembled EOLPs but also repaired ones because, as mentioned before, a repair operation may involve replacement of functional components.

The ARTODTO system proposed in this paper has four criteria (i.e., total cost, number of disposed items, material sales revenue, and customers’ satisfaction level) to be optimized. The order of the criteria is totally random. In other words, the first objective is not necessarily more important than the others. The importance of criteria is integrated using the weights calculated by LPPW based on DM’s targets. The ideal range for a criterion is determined by solving a single objective LP problem with the corresponding criterion as the objective function. Other ranges are determined depending on DM’s experience and preferences.

Total Cost (TC) is the sum of total disassembly cost (TDC), total repair cost (TRPC), total outside procurement cost (TOPC), total disposal cost (TDIC), total recycling cost (TRC) and total holding cost (THC). Therefore the total cost function can be written as follows:

                        CSL is a conceptual notion and calculated as the sum of two terms, namely, CSL
                        1 and CSL
                        2. CSL
                        1 is assumed to be the sum of the differences between the highest life bins that components could be placed and the life bins they are actually evaluated in. For repair case (CSL
                        2), the same calculation is performed for all components in the product using the product’s target life bin. Therefore,

                        Eq. (24) ensures that an EOLP in the inventory is disassembled, repaired, disposed of, recycled or left untouched (stored); (25) introduces complete disassembly; (26) makes sure each EOLP is accounted once in repair; (27) and (28) ensures that product and component demands are met, respectively; (29) determines what bin the disassembled remaining life deficient components are placed in; (30) and (31) ensure that any remaining-life-deficient component is in one and only one “proper” bin; (32) takes care of the repair operations of broken, missing and remaining-life deficient components; (33) makes sure that repair is done with appropriate parts; (34) ensures that replacement of a component can be taken from only one bin; (35) enforces the model to fulfill the material demand; (36) makes sure all nonfunctional components are either disposed of or recycled; (37) introduces the non-negativity property of the linear programming model.

Therefore the LPP model can be written as follows:

To illustrate the methodology, a device-embedded (i.e., sensors and RFID tags) residential air-conditioner (AC) case is considered. There are 200 EOLPs and 10 components/subassemblies that the model deals with. The components and the disassembly precedence relationships among them are depicted in Fig. 4
                     .

Three remaining-life-bins are defined for recovered components. The first life-bin holds those components that have a remaining-life time of 2years or less, the second life-bin holds those components whose remaining-lives are between two and three years. The last bin holds the rest (components having 3years or more remaining life). Same remaining life time ranges are used to define product life-bins. Remaining life time based component demands, outside procurement prices, disassembly, assembly, holding and recycling costs are given in Table 2
                     .

Repaired product demands are assumed to be 8, 10, and 12 for the remaining life bins 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There are 2 types of materials that are recovered by recycling, namely, plastic and copper. Component material yields, material demands, sale prices and holding costs are given in Table 3
                     .

Desirability ranges and target values for each criterion are given in Table 4
                     . Ideal target values for the first, second, and forth objectives are obtained by solving single objective models with corresponding objective functions. The third objective, however, results in an unbounded solution when solved. Thus, the best material sales revenue value ($5422.00) obtained in other three single objective solutions, is taken as the lower limit to the desirable range of this objective.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

LPPW algorithm was coded and run using MATLAB. Soft class functions obtained from LPPW are exhibited in Fig. 5
                     .

Normalized weights of the aggregate objective function of the LP model are given in Table 6
                     . The mathematical model was constructed and solved using LINGO 11.0. Table 7
                      shows the values of the performance measures after solving the LP model.

EOLPs that are disassembled, repaired, disposed of, recycled and stored are shown in Table 8
                     . According to this table, 70 EOLPs are disassembled in order to meet the component demand; 30 EOLPs are repaired to satisfy the product demand; no EOLPs are selected directly for disposal or recycle, and 100 EOLPs are stored.


                     Table 9
                      shows a small portion of the repair plan. According to this plan, EOLP #7 has to be repaired to produce a product that has a remaining life of at most two years. In other words, the model picks EOLP #7 to fulfill the demand for a product having at most two years of remaining life. A small portion of the disassembly plan is also given in Table 10
                     . Disassembly plan shows the bin numbers in which a disassembled component is placed. Finally, detailed recycling and disposal plans are exhibited in Table 11
                     .

As the literature review suggests, environmentally conscious manufacturing and product recovery has drawn increasing attention of researchers. One of the most important limitations of this concept is the uncertainty about the quality, quantity and timing of returned products. We also provided a number of references to justify the use of sensor-embedded products (SEPs) to eliminate aforementioned uncertainty. Presented case study shows that information collected and stored on the embedded devices can be used to design a recovery system that can selectively process returned products in order to satisfy the demands for reusable components and products.

The selection of returned products for all tasks was given in Table 8. One should note that this selection was done without any preliminary disassembly and testing operations, which would not be possible if it was not for the life-cycle data provided by the embedded sensors. Another notable benefit of the ARTODTO was, as summarized in Table 9, to pick and choose products for different product remaining-life-bins in such a way that optimizes the overall satisfaction of the customers’. Similarly, disassembled components are also grouped based on their remaining lives and the overall component demand. Finally, ARTODTO makes sure disposed and recycled components are either non-functional or of the lowest quality level (shortest remaining-life bin).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

With the alarming downfall of virgin resources, environmental conscious manufacturing and product recovery (ECMPRO) has recently gained a lot of attention from both researchers and practitioners. One of the main hurdles encountered in recovery operations is the uncertainty about the quantity and condition of the end-of-life products (EOLPs). Sensor embedded products (SEPs) embedded with active RFID tags with sensors mitigate end-of-life (EOL) management and product recovery by providing valuable static and dynamic information about their history.

In this paper, a multi-criteria advanced repair-to-order and disassembly-to-order (ARTODTO) system was proposed. The proposed system was designed in such a way that emerging information technology devices (viz. sensors and RFID tags) are utilized to reach the optimum disassembly, repair, disposal, recycling and storage plans in a demand-driven environment. Then, a linear physical program (LPP) which utilized the life-cycle data collected, stored and delivered by sensors and RFID tags was developed to optimize various conflicting objectives, viz, total cost (financial objective), number of disposed items (environmental objective), material sales revenue (financial objective), customers’ satisfaction level (quality objective). The proposed product recovery system uses the remaining-life as a measure of quality and aims to increase customers’ satisfaction level by providing them with longer lasting products. The optimal solution of the model provided the serial numbers of the products to be subjected to various recovery operations. The solution also provided the detailed item-based repair. Therefore, this paper made its unique contribution to the literature by proposing an advanced product recovery system that utilizes valuable life-cycle data to make informed recovery decisions and presenting a solid measure for the quality of returned products to replace vague categorical approaches seen in the literature.

A case example was considered to illustrate the application of the proposed approach and solved using MATLAB and LINGO 11.0 software packages. The optimal values of the first and third objectives fell in the “Tolerable” range, the second objective fell in the “Highly Undesirable” range, and the last objective fell in the “Undesirable” range showing how unrealistic (optimistic) the DM’s expectations were.

Our experiments showed that the problem space grows drastically when the total number of returned products and their components increase. A computational complexity analysis is still to be performed to quantify the difficulty of the problem as a future research. Also, in order to increase the applicability of the model to bigger problems with multiple product types with many more reusable components, a more efficient solution methodology (optimal or near optimal) can be developed. Moreover, in future studies, the proposed model can be adjusted for specific situations. For example, in cases where complete disassembly is not feasible and/or needed, some extra constraints will be necessary.
