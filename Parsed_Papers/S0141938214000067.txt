                  This paper proposes a power-efficient drive circuit for plasma display panels (PDPs). The proposed circuit reduces reactive power consumption by varying the inductance for energy recovery and by separating the grounds of the sustain and data drivers. Power consumption due to discharge current is reduced by using two soft-switching inductors for the pull-up switches in the bridge circuit. Power consumption for data addressing is reduced by using a dc voltage source to bias the ground for the sustain driver. The proposed circuit was tested on a 50″ full-HD single-scan PDP which had a sustain discharge gap of 80μm; total power consumption to display the dynamic broadcasting content of IEC 62087 was ∼40W (14.5%) less than that required by the conventional drive circuit, and the EMI level for 2<
                     f
                     <9MHz was reduced significantly. The experimental results demonstrate that a high performance power-efficient PDP drive circuit can be built using the proposed method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Major sources of power dissipation in the drive circuit of a plasma display panel (PDP) (Fig. 1
                     ) are ohmic loss on the sustain current path (Fig. 1, between nodes b and b′), hard-switching loss on the pull-up switches (Fig. 1, Q
                     1
                     
                        Y
                      and Q
                     1
                     
                        Z
                     ), and switching loss on the data drive circuit. Ohmic loss on the sustain current path can be reduced by decreasing the capacitances between panel electrodes [1], by separating the ground for sustain circuit (CHGND) from the ground for data drive circuit (FGND) during the sustain period [2], or by both methods. The switching loss on the data drive circuit can be reduced by using a dc voltage bias between CHGND and FGND for the address period [3]; this bias allows use of a low-voltage data pulse.

The leading and trailing edge (Fig. 2
                     , ER_UP and ER_DN) waveforms of sustain pulses are generated by a resonance between the energy recovery (ER) inductors (LY
                      and LZ
                     ) and the panel capacitance Cp
                     
                     ≡
                     CYZ
                     
                     +
                     CYX
                     , where CYZ
                      is capacitance between the scan electrode Y and common electrode Z, and CYX
                      is capacitance between Y and the data electrode X. The resonance current decreases as ER inductance increases, so ohmic loss on the path of sustain current can also be reduced by increasing ER inductance. An increase of ER inductance causes the sustain discharge to be unstable when the number of ON cells on the panel (picture load PL) increases, because the gas discharge starts during the ER_UP period and the initial discharge current should be supplied through the ER inductors. One approach to solve this problem is to use the current injection method [4–10] in which the initial current for ER_UP is increased by applying a voltage source to the ER inductor before ER_UP. The increased ER current helps induce the sustain discharge properly. However, the current injection method does not much improve the power efficiency for high PL because the ohmic loss on the ER current path increases to build up the initial ER current.

Another approach is to use the pull-up switches Q
                     1
                     
                        Y
                      and Q
                     1
                     
                        Z
                      
                     [11]. The panel voltage VY
                      increases abruptly to the sustain voltage VSUS
                      by closing one pull-up switch before completing a quarter of the ER resonance period, so the discharge current flows through the pull-up switch. Bypassing the discharge current decreases ohmic loss on the ER current path but increases hard-switching loss in the pull-up switches. The hard-switching loss increases with PL because the SUS_UP state starts earlier when PL is heavy than when it is light; this loss degrades the power efficiency.

This paper presents a power-efficient drive circuit for PDPs. The circuit combines all previous methods of reducing PDP power consumption and improves the power efficiency by using two additional techniques: varying the ER inductance, and soft-switching the pull-up switches. The circuit has two separate ER paths to vary the ER inductance in accordance with PL. The ER inductances are L
                     1 for one path and L
                     2
                     <
                     L
                     1 for the other. The ER path with L
                     1 operates at low PL, the other operates at medium PL, and both operate at high PL. To reduce the hard-switching loss of the pull-up switches, the circuit uses two soft-switching inductors connected between the pull-up switches and the VSUS
                      source. Various methods of saving PDP power consumption are summarized in Section 2, the proposed circuit is described in Section 3, and the experimental results on a 50″ full-HD PDP are given in Section 4. A conclusion is given in Section 5.

For a PDP that uses the address-display-separated method [12], some power is consumed during the address period because the charging/discharging current to X electrodes flows through the data drive circuit. This power loss can be reduced by using an energy recovery circuit [13] and by decreasing the data voltage VX
                      
                     [2]. The addressed picture is displayed during the sustain period, so considerable power is consumed during this period. This power consumption consists of reactive power consumption which is power loss caused by charging and discharging the panel capacitance, and discharge power consumption which is required to display the picture by inducing glow discharge. Reactive power consumption is important when the picture load is low, and discharge power consumption is important when PL is high. Discharge power consumption occurs in the panel and on the pull-up switches, so it can be reduced by soft-switching the pull-up switches.

The source of reactive power consumption in a PDP drive circuit is the ohmic loss in the ER path. In a series resonant ER circuit (Fig. 1), the ER current iL
                         is given by

                        where L
                        ≡
                        LY
                        
                        =
                        LZ
                        . Ohmic loss for a given ER path resistance R is proportional to

                                    L
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                        , so this loss can be reduced by decreasing Cp
                         or by increasing L; in floating sustain method, Cp
                         is decreased [2] by separating CHGND from FGND for the sustain period, and in the current injection method, L is increased.

The floating sustain method was proposed originally to suppress the facial discharge between X and Y, and between X and Z, during the sustain period [2]. In Fig. 1, FGND can be separated from CHGND by switching off the floating switch QFL
                           . The panel capacitance Cp
                            changes from CYZ
                           
                           +
                           CYX
                            to CYZ
                           
                           +
                           CYX
                           /2 when QFL
                            is switched off, so the floating sustain method can be used to reduce the reactive power consumption (Fig. 2a).

The sustain voltage and current waveforms for the conventional and floating sustain methods were measured at L
                           =400nH and VSUS
                           
                           =200V on a 50″ full-HD experimental PDP from LG electronics Co. (Fig. 2b). The PDP had CYZ
                           
                           =122nF and CYX
                           
                           =

                           =62nF. Thus, Cp
                            decreased from 184nF to 153nF (∼17%) when QFL
                            was switched off; it is expected from (1) that the peak of iL
                           (t) would decrease by 8.9% for this change of Cp
                           . Both the conventional and floating sustain methods produced similar VY
                            waveforms, and VCHGND
                            for the floating sustain method was ∼VY
                           /2. The peak of iL
                            changed from 68A (conventional) to 62A (floating sustain), which is ∼8.8% decrease.

Luminous efficiency ηe
                           
                           =
                           πEVA/PM
                           , where EV
                            is luminous intensity, A is the displayed area, and PM
                            is the power supplied to PDP module [14], was measured using a CA-100 plus color analyzer from Minolta Inc., while displaying 4%, 9%, 16% and 25% white window box patterns (Fig. 3
                           a). The durations of ER_UP and ER_DN states affect both EV
                            and PM
                           , so these states were adjusted for this measurement to maximize ηe
                           . Compared with the conventional sustain method, the floating sustain method increase ηe
                            by 6.15% for the 4% picture load and by 1–2% for the other PLs. At high PL, the floating sustain method produced a small increase in ηe
                            because the portion of reactive power in PM
                            became small (Fig. 3b); the discharging power consumption curve intersected the reactive power curve at PL ∼10%.

The reactive power consumption of a PDP can be reduced also by increasing ER inductance, thus decreasing iL
                            (Eq. (1)). However, this increase of ER inductance produces an unstable sustain discharge at high PL. One possible method of solving this problem is to vary the ER inductance in accordance with PL. Replacing the circuit between nodes b and b′ in Fig. 1 with the circuit in Fig. 4
                            results in three different ER inductances: LY
                           
                           1 using path 1, LY

The 50″ full-HD experimental PDP could be driven stably using LY

                           =700nH was used for 10<PL<45%. The peak ER currents calculated using Eq. (1) for the experimental PDP were 45.2A for LY

                           2)=400nH. When LY
                           
                           1
                           =900nH and LY
                           
                           2
                           =700nH were used to drive the experimental PDP, instead of LY
                           
                           =400nH, the improvement of η
                           e was 11.6% at PL=4% and decreased as PL increased (Fig. 5
                           ).

The floating sustain and variable ER inductance methods did not effectively increase ηe
                         at high PL, because discharge power consumption was much higher than reactive power consumption. The discharge current was supplied through pull-up switches Q
                        1

                           Z
                         (Fig. 1), so ηe
                         can be increased by reducing the hard-switching loss in the pull-up switches. Soft-switching of the pull-up switches is possible if the circuit between nodes b and b′ (Fig. 1) is replaced with the proposed circuit (Fig. 6
                        ). The modifications from the Y drive circuit in Fig. 1 were as follows: an inductor LDY
                         was placed between the drain (Fig. 6, node c) of switches and the VSUS
                         source to limit initial switching current, and the ER inductor LY
                         and two protection diodes (D

                        ). The Z drive circuit was modified in the same way.

The proposed soft-switching sustain circuit was tested on the 50″ full-HD experimental PDP. The measured switch voltage VDS

                        =200nH (Fig. 7
                        ) show that the hard-switching loss was negligible. ηe
                         for 100% PL was measured at LD

                        a). ηe
                         for 100% PL was ∼11.6% lower at LD
                        
                        =0nH than at LD
                        
                        =200nH. At LD
                        
                        ⩽200nH, ηe
                         increased with LD
                         because IDS
                         decreased at a high LD
                        . At LD
                        
                        =300nH, IDS
                         was too low to support strong sustain discharge. ηe
                         values for PLs of 45%, 70%, and 100% were measured at LD
                        
                        =0nH and 200nH (Fig. 8b); the soft-switching of pull-up switches increased ηe
                         by ∼4.2% for 45% PL, by ∼ 9.9% for 70% PL, and 11.6% for 100% PL.

The light emissions from sustain discharge were measured using APD module C5331-03 from Hamamatsu Photonics Co. (Fig. 9
                        ). The soft-switching of pull-up switches using LD
                        
                        =200nH lowered and spread the light emission peaks (Fig. 9a and b), when compared with the light emission for 100% PL at LD
                        
                        =0nH (Fig. 9a). A similar tendency was observed at LD
                        
                        =200nH when PL increased from 45% to 100% (Fig. 9b and c). Lowering and spreading the light emission helps improve ηe
                         because the ohmic loss in the SUS_UP path decreases as discharge current IDS
                         decreases. LD
                         caused an overshoot of sustain voltage by VSUS
                        
                        −
                        VER

                           UP
                        , where VER_UP
                         is the voltage of Y and Z electrodes at the end of ER_UP period. Because the overshoot voltage does not depend on Cp
                         which can vary with the PL, it can provide an advantage of lowering VSUS
                         without narrowing the VSUS
                         margin window.

The biased scan method was proposed to reduce power consumption in the data drive circuit [3]. This method uses two grounds: FGND and CHGND similar to the floating sustain method. To lower the data drive voltage, FGND is biased during the address period using a dc voltage source, but is connected to CHGND during the reset and sustain periods. When the drive circuit uses the floating sustain method, the biased scan can be implemented at low additional cost because it requires a switch QBIAS
                         and dc voltage source VX_BIAS
                         only (Fig. 10
                        ).

                      was turned on but QBIAS
                      was turned off during the reset period to achieve appropriate reset operation. QBIAS
                      was turned on but QFL
                      was turned off during the address period, so FGND was biased by a dc voltage source VX_BIAS
                     , which achieved the biased scan. To implement the floating sustain method, FGND was separated from CHGND during the sustain period by turning off QFL
                      and QBIAS
                     . The circuit had two ER paths: Q5–Q

The waveforms shown in Fig. 11
                      were used to drive the experimental PDP. In the experimental PDP drive circuit, the waveforms for reset and address operations were generated using the set-up and set-down ramp generators (Q6 and Q7, respectively), and using the scan and data drive ICs, in the same way as in the conventional drive circuits [3].

The proposed PDP drive circuit was implemented using five circuit boards (Fig. 12
                     ); scan pulses, data pulses, and control signals for switches were generated on the scan, X drive, and control boards, respectively. The sustain pulses, reset voltage ramps, and VX_BIAS
                      and VZ_BIAS
                      voltages were generated on the Z and Y drive boards. The grounds for Z and Y boards (FGNDs) were connected using the alternate wire connection method [2]. The following components were used for the Z and Y drive boards: CER

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

The proposed circuit was tested on the experimental PDP which had S–C gap space of 80μm and Xe content of 15%. Operating conditions were VSUS
                     
                     =200V, VZ_BIAS
                     
                     =100V, −V
                     y
                     =190V, VSC
                     
                     =140V, VBR
                     
                     =340V, VSR
                     
                     =280V, and VSCAN_BASE
                     
                     =50V. The number of subfields was nine and the number of sustain pulses was varied using the average picture level method [15]. The experimental circuit produced the desired waveforms (Fig. 12b). The minimum VX
                      versus VX_BIAS
                      for displaying a full white picture was measured (Fig. 13
                     a); the minimum VX
                      decreased linearly as VX_BIAS
                      increased. Erroneous address discharges were observed on the OFF cells for VX_BIAS
                     
                     >35V. Based on this experiment, VX
                     
                     =45V and VX_BIAS
                     
                     =30V were chosen as the operating condition.

The range of VSUS
                      versus VX
                      for proper operation was measured at the operating conditions for the proposed method, and at VSUS
                     
                     =200V, VZ_BIAS
                     
                     =100V, −V
                     y
                     =190V, VSC
                     
                     =155V, VBR
                     
                     =340V, VSR
                     
                     =280V, and VSCAN_BASE
                     
                     =50V to set ΔVy
                     
                     =
                     VZ_BIAS
                     
                     +
                     VSC
                     
                     −(−Vy
                     )=15V for the conventional method (Fig. 13b). The minimum VX
                      and the maximum VSUS
                      (VSUS, max
                     ) for proper operation were 35V and 201V respectively for the proposed method, and 40V and 210V respectively for the conventional method. For both methods, the minimum VSUS
                     
                     (VSUS, min
                     ) decreased from VSUS, max
                      as VX
                      increased because the amount of wall charge on Y of the ON cells increased, then saturated at 185V for the proposed method and at 194V for the conventional method. The cause of the observed shift of VSUS, max
                      and VSUS, min
                      for the proposed method was an overshoot of sustain pulses due to a resonance between Cp
                      and the soft-switching inductors LDY
                      and LDZ
                     .


                     ηe
                      versus PL curves were measured using the conventional and proposed methods (Fig. 14
                     ). The proposed method resulted in higher ηe
                      than the conventional method by 13.1%, 11.7%, 8.7%, 6.4%, 2.1%, 7.8%, and 8.7% at PLs of 4%, 9%, 16%, 25%, 45%, 70%, and 100%, respectively. The average power was measured using an HPM-100A integrating wattmeter from AD Power Co., while displaying dynamic broadcasting contents of IEC 62087 [16] (Table 1
                     ). For this measurement, the number of sustain pulses was adjusted such that both the conventional and proposed methods resulted in the same luminance at each PL. The proposed method decreased VX
                      power consumption by 15.7W, increased VX_BIAS
                      consumption by 1.2W, and decreased VSUS
                      power consumption by 25.7W, so this method decreased total power consumption by 40.2W(∼14.5%).

The radiative electromagnetic interference (EMI) level at the drain of pull-up switch Q
                     1
                     
                        Y
                      was measured using a E4408 spectrum analyzer from Agilent Inc. with an LF1 near-field probe from Langer EMV-Technik, while displaying a full-white pattern (Fig. 15
                     a and b). The low-frequency peaks observed at an interval of 200kHz were caused by the sustain pulses of frequency f
                     =200kHz. When compared with the conventional method, the proposed method decreased the amplitude of these peaks because it used a soft-switching discharge current. Also, the proposed method decreased the EMI level for 2<
                     f
                     <9MHz significantly; the value of the peak marked at f
                     =3.7MHz (Fig. 15a) was 21.63dBm for the conventional method, but that of the peak marked at f
                     =2.92MHz (Fig. 15b) was 13.93dBm for the proposed method. The noise spectrum in output current of VSUS
                      power supply was measured also using SI-9002 differential probe from Sapphire Instruments Co., Ltd (Fig. 15c and d). Noise reduction in the VSUS
                      current was less significant than that of the radiative EMI at the drain of Q1Y
                     , because the experimental circuit had an EMI filter; the peak marked at f
                     =2.93MHz (Fig. 15c) was −19.26dBm and the one at f
                     =2.98MHz (Fig. 15d) was −25.42dBm. These results demonstrate that the proposed circuit also helps reduce EMI.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A power-efficient drive circuit for plasma display panels (PDPs) is proposed. It adopted four power reduction methods: floating sustain, variable ER inductance, soft-switching of pull-up switches, and biased scan. Reactive power consumption was reduced by varying the inductance for energy recovery and by separating the grounds for sustain and data drivers. Power consumption due to discharge current was reduced by using two soft-switching inductors for the pull-up switches in the bridge circuit. Power consumption for data addressing was reduced by using a dc voltage source to bias the ground for sustain driver. The proposed circuit was tested on a 50″ full-HD single-scan PDP which had a sustain discharge gap of 80μm. Total power consumption for displaying the dynamic broadcasting content of IEC 62087 was decreased by ∼40W (14.5%) from that required for the conventional drive circuit. The proposed method decreased the EMI level for 2<
                     f
                     <9MHz significantly. These results demonstrate that a high performance power-efficient PDP drive circuit can be built using the proposed method.
