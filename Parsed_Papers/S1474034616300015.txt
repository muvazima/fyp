                  Survivors trapped in void spaces formed when buildings collapse in an earthquake may be saved if search and rescue (SAR) operations are quick. A novel computational approach aims to provide building information that can guide SAR teams, thus minimizing their risk and accelerating operations. The inputs are an ‘as-built’ BIM model of the building before an earthquake and a partial ‘as-damaged’ BIM model of the exterior components after the earthquake derived from a terrestrial laser scan. A large set of possible collapse patterns is generated before the earthquake. After the event, the pattern with geometry most similar to that of the ‘as-damaged’ exterior BIM can be selected rapidly. This paper details the selection methods, which use least sum of point distances and Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC) algorithms, and illustrates their operation on a series of simulated computer models of collapsed structures, thus demonstrating the potential feasibility of the proposed approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Collapsed buildings are the most significant direct cause of death and injury in earthquakes in urban areas. Search and rescue is hampered by the difficulty of locating victims; a recent review of the state-of-the-art in technology for search and rescue identified the need for development of new tools to locate victims [1]. Survivors are most likely to be found in void spaces (triangles of life) that are formed naturally in damaged buildings [2]. They can be saved only if search and rescue (SAR) operations are quick and efficient, because the probability of survival decreases rapidly over time. Tunneling from void to void to reach a trapped occupant, a common rescue method, is slow and dangerous work but frequently required in order to reach trapped occupants [3,4]. Information about the structural elements and other large building elements, their original sizes, composition and material, and their new locations in the damaged building, would enable SAR teams to search selectively and thus minimize the risk and accelerate the search process.

However, with existing technology, no information about the existing voids or the state of the internal structural system of the damaged building can be provided, making it difficult for decision makers on site to choose the safest and most efficient void from which to begin. The authors propose a technological approach that can provide this information during SAR operations.

As the literature review below reveals, most existing automated damage assessment methods provide broad classifications of the damaged state of entire buildings, with only generic, descriptive information about the possible conditions within a building. Existing applications of laser scanning for earthquakes, for example, can only determine the location and damage type classification of each building [5]. Kashani et al. [6] used terrestrial laser scanning to survey homes damaged by a tornado and succeeded in identifying damage to roofs and walls of individual buildings. A promising procedure is that of Zeibak-Shini et al. [7], which provides information about the exterior components of a damaged building using terrestrial laser-scanning and a pre-existing Building Information Modeling (BIM) model. However, it too cannot reveal anything about the interior components.

In response to these limitations, this research explores the use of BIM technology and simulation tools for estimating potential collapse patterns to rapidly derive detailed information about the interior geometry of a damaged building, its systems and its contents, for the use of SAR teams. The proposed method relies on two sources of information: (a) detailed definitions of the state of a building before an earthquake event, embodied in an as-built BIM model and (b) a partial BIM model of the visible exterior components of a damaged building, compiled using the procedure developed by Zeibak-Shini et al. [7]. The research objective is to demonstrate the proposed method and its potential feasibility, which is dependent on rapid processing of information after the earthquake event. The information includes the potential collapse patterns, which are generated before the earthquake event. After the event, the information is screened and filtered to select the most likely pattern(s).

The background and literature review section that follows reviews existing automated approaches to acquire information about buildings in the period immediately after an earthquake event. It also provides the necessary background to BIM and the simulation technologies that are needed in the proposed solution. The third section outlines the proposed process, placing the structural simulation and model selection components that are covered in this paper in the context of the overall process that includes laser scanning and derivation of the exterior as-damaged model. The collapse engine and the selection (screening) algorithms are the subjects of the fourth and fifth sections respectively. Following the layout of the process components, the series of tests conducted to illustrate the basic feasibility of the concept are described in Section 6. The discussion and conclusion Sections 7 and 8 highlight what has been achieved and what remains for future research and development.

After an earthquake in an urban area, the number and location of collapsed buildings are unknown, as is the number and medical state of the people trapped inside these buildings. For efficient disaster recovery response SAR teams need information about the location and state of damaged or partially or totally collapsed buildings in the affected area [8]. Therefore the need arises for rapid and reliable information gathering [9–12]. Remote sensing techniques for data collection (such as airborne or terrestrial laser scanning [8,13]) and other sensor-based technologies (such as accelerometers [14]) are especially suitable for obtaining large scale information about the damaged area after a disaster. The data collected by sensors can be processed using methods such as error-domain model falsification to overcome uncertainties of residual structural resistance that arise from incomplete data [15].

By comparing undamaged, pre-event, scanning data with data collected after the earthquake, information about the location and damage characteristic of each building can be retrieved [16]. The information derived from data collected by scanners or photogrammetry will include the location and even the damage type of each affected building which are the main factors in deciding the needed SAR resources for each partially or totally collapsed building. Yet the most important information about the internal condition and the possible locations of trapped occupants in each building is not available and cannot be derived from the scans.

Another approach that has been proposed is to collect video and/or photo images of the damaged building and to recognize cracks and other damage in structural components using image recognition algorithms [17,18]. Cameras may be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) [19]. This has the advantage of speed, but it too cannot provide information about the internal conditions.

Schweier and Markus [5] developed a classification system of collapsed buildings based on analysis of a large data set of post-earthquake damage reports and photographs. This “damage catalogue” includes ten different damage types of entire buildings typically occurring after earthquakes. Each damage type has specific geometrical features that can be detected by comparing pre-event scanning data with post-event scanning data. The damage type of each affected building can be determined.

Identification of damage type allows fast and efficient allocation of SAR teams and resources, but cannot provide enough information to enable a more efficient search inside each damaged building. The ‘disaster management tool’ (DMT) is a software application that was developed to try to provide complementary information about potential survivors. One part of the DMT consists of casualty estimation based on building stock and residential data together with estimation of damage type based on laser scanning data. Another part of the system is based on the augmented reality (AR) technology which provides a three dimensional view of the building before damage superposed with the actual image of the damaged building [20]. The comparison of the real collapsed building view with the view of the building before damage, from different perspectives, can help discover areas with possible voids and possible locations of trapped survivors. Nevertheless, the view of the internal geometry, which ultimately defines the void spaces, is revealed only when physically going into the ruins.

The motivation of this research is to provide this needed information with minimum risk to the SAR team. Providing this information before going into the ruins can help decision makers and enable a selective, more efficient, and less dangerous search.

Situational awareness of the search site is crucial for decision makers in SAR operations [1]. The need for new technologies, or improvement of existing technologies, for searching an urban disaster area for survivors is a key driver for research such as the EU “Second Generation Locator for Urban Search and Rescue Operations” project (EU-SGL) [21], which identified that the first information priority needed is general and quick assessment of victim location [1]. Various tools are available for locating trapped victims in the rubble of collapsed buildings each has advantages and disadvantages [22]. Electronic devices like small diameter search cameras are used to penetrate into void spaces to provide information about the trapped victims, but often visibility is limited due to dust or smoke. Infrared systems (IR) are used in a similar way, detecting sources of heat. They are especially effective in smoky environments, although the information they provide is often inaccurate due to sources of heat other than from the human victims. Acoustic devices are also used to detect victims but their use is severely limited in noisy search sites. Another disadvantage is the inability of such devices to locate unconscious victims. Another new method is the use of microwave life detection systems which can detect breathing and heartbeat signals of human subjects through rubble or a construction barrier of about 10-ft thickness [23].

More recent developments include the use of robots, equipped with different sensors, that can explore voids deep inside the rubble, going through spaces that are too small for a human to crawl through, areas of fire or areas without breathable air. Research in this area poses many challenges, such as the need for many different sensors to be mounted on a small sized robot, and mobility issues of the robots [24,25].

Canine search is often used together with the electronic tools to locate survivors (trapped or unconscious) and bodies. The search dogs are trained to find the scent of a human and indicate a find to their handlers, by barking for example. Although the dogs are well trained their abilities are affected by many environmental conditions and the search process is quite slow. It should also be noted that the number of trained search dogs is limited [22] and that the training process is long.

While all of the above mentioned methods and technologies improve the situational awareness of the SAR teams, they are not able to provide complete or accurate descriptions of the interior of the building. Information about the formation and location of the voids inside the rubbles is limited as the different sensors can only provide visualizations of small areas. Information about access holes and rescue paths is also very limited.

When dealing with an individual building, laser scanning data is no longer sufficient. A BIM model is highly appropriate for providing information about the structural and nonstructural elements of the concerned building. Structural elements, infrastructure, furniture etc. can all be represented in a BIM model, which consists of elements represented using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). A BIM model contains information not only about the geometry, but also about the elements’ properties and their spatial relationships [26].

‘As-built’ models naturally represent only the pre-event state of a building. A semi-automated process has been developed that is capable of generating a BIM model that represents the damaged condition of the external façades of a reinforced concrete frame building after an earthquake [27]. As illustrated in Fig. 1
                        , the method requires input of terrestrial laser scans of the damaged building, an ‘as-built’ building model, and limited user input for initial spatial registration. It identifies candidate structural frame objects on the building’s façade within the point cloud data by sectioning the point cloud according to the thickness of the façade, finding and segmenting openings (formed by windows or collapse of masonry), and mapping those to the openings in the structural frame in the ‘as-built’ BIM. It then maps the known frame components (beams, columns and walls) from the ‘as-built’ to the ‘as-damaged’ locations. The result is an ‘as-damaged’ BIM model of the facades of the structure. The method has been tested on two case study buildings (from the 2003 Bingol and 2008 Kocaeli earthquakes, both in Turkey) using synthetic TLS data [28]. However, it cannot provide any information about the interior elements, which is essential for defining the formation of voids.

In practice, representing the post-event state of a building poses an additional difficulty: the damaged elements of a building cannot be modeled in existing BIM tools and the BIM model exchange standard data model, the Industry Foundation Class (IFC) schema, does not have the necessary object classes and relationships. An extension to the IFC schema for representation of damaged reinforced concrete objects has been proposed [29] but these capabilities are not yet available in the IFC or in commercial software.

Efficient rescue of trapped occupants depends, among other factors, on the ability of rescuers to navigate inside the damaged building. For this reason numerous emergency response studies have focused on the development of indoor navigation systems, some of which are integrated with BIM models. Guven et al. [30] suggested creating a graph network based on a building information model, together with sensors that are deployed inside the building, to determine the shortest path and display it to the rescuer.

Other BIM based systems have been developed, mostly for fire fighters (both for practice and real emergency response). For instance, an Environment-Aware radio frequency beacon deployment algorithm for Sequence Based Localization (EASBL), which relies on BIM, can provide information about the location of both trapped occupants as well as rescue teams in real-time. By using a BIM model it can not only identify the spaces in which people are located, but it can also evaluate the accessibility to these spaces based on their usage and the spread of fire and smoke [31].

The aforementioned methods are mostly effective in buildings that have suffered minor damage, such as damage caused by fire. They are not suitable, and were not designed for buildings that have partially collapsed or suffered heavy damage. The basic building geometry represented in the BIM models is not updated; it maintains its original ‘as-built’ state. Furthermore, all processes that rely on sensors located inside the building may be unreliable where damage to the building is such that the sensors are themselves damaged and cease to function.

@&#PROPOSED METHOD@&#

The method proposed in this research extends all of the above efforts by providing information about the interior elements of earthquake-damaged buildings. It aims to generate new and useful information about the location and volumetric geometry of void spaces, as well as information about the structural elements, their original size, composition and material, and their location in the damaged building, all of which can be used to guide SAR teams. Future implementations will be able to include partitions, ducts, pipes and heavy furniture in the collapse models if these are available in the BIM model.

The method uses the pre-event BIM model of the building in a suitable collapse engine to create different possible damage patterns of the building, compiling an extensive database before the earthquake strikes. After the earthquake, SAR teams scan the building they are assigned to deal with and compute the ‘as-damaged’ BIM of the facades using the approach developed by Zeibak-Shini et al. [27]. The scanning process is expected to require a duration of 1–3h, based on experience gained scanning building facades. Derivation of the ‘as-damaged’ façade BIM requires minutes.

Each possible damage pattern from the database is then analyzed and compared with the ‘as-damaged’ exterior BIM. The computation of the set of collapse models before the earthquake and the selection algorithm run after the earthquake to identify the most likely result, are the heart of this work.

The method is outlined in the flow chart presented in Fig. 2
                     . The whole process can be divided into three steps:
                        
                           
                              Step 1: Solution space generation. The BIM model of the building before collapse (1) is imported into the collapse engine (2). The collapse engine software is required to estimate the potential dynamic behavior of the building in 3-D, based on the structural topology, the physical behavior of the structural components, the behavior of the joints, the soil-structure interaction, and a range of expected earthquake parameters (3) to a satisfactory level of relevance. The expected output is a space of possible damage patterns of the concerned building (4). In order to create a set of diverse possible collapse patterns, a series of parametrically differing ground movements is applied to the model to trigger a series of potential collapse mechanisms. Alternatively, a series of parametrically differing geometric, material, or structural parameters can be applied to the model to generate the series of collapse mechanisms. The result is a very large data set of possible damage patterns (candidate solutions) for the building, called the solution space, marked (4) in Fig. 2. Each of the candidate solutions is a BIM model that contains the exterior and interior geometry of the deformed state of the building.


                              Step 2: Scanning and processing. A terrestrial laser scan is performed after the building is damaged (5). The scanning data is analyzed and a post-event BIM model is generated whose objects represent only the exterior elements of the building. The objects in this model represent the actual displacements of the exterior elements of the damaged building (6). This step uses the procedure developed by Zeibak-Shini et al. [27], which is outside the scope of this paper.


                              Step 3: The matching process. Once the actual post-disaster exterior BIM model becomes available, the most appropriate single solution (or small group of solutions) that approximately describes the real collapse pattern of the exterior of the building is identified from the set of candidate solutions. Each candidate solution, created in step 1, describes a possible damage pattern of the whole building, including exterior and interior elements. Each solution is graded, using an appropriate mathematical algorithm (7), to provide a quantitative measure of the degree of similarity to the actual exterior model. It is postulated that the solution with the highest degree of similarity provides the most relevant (“best”) information on the damage pattern of the exterior and interior geometry of the building (8).

The process is a “pre-calculated” approach, meaning that the solution space is generated before the earthquake strikes. This requires extensive computing time and storage of a very large set of solutions. An alternative, “post-calculated” approach, in which the collapse patterns are calculated after the earthquake event, was considered but rejected. The ‘post-calculated’ approach has the apparent advantage of knowledge of the properties of the actual earthquake event, which could significantly narrow the generation of the solution space or allow deterministic computation of the structural collapse geometry of a building’s components. However, it suffers three critical drawbacks. First, even with full knowledge of an earthquake’s epicenter location and the seismographic record of the ground acceleration at select locations, the actual ground motion at the building’s location is unknown, partly because the site conditions, and their seismic behavior, vary greatly. Second, any imperfections in a building’s construction can profoundly influence its response. Even neighboring buildings that are identical in design have been observed to respond quite differently in an earthquake [32]. Third, given that deterministic computation is not possible, a very large solution space is still required even if the basic earthquake parameters are known and this requires an amount of time that is not available. Under these conditions, pre-calculation has a great practical advantage: the time it takes to prepare and run the simulations is not part of the response time after the event.
                        
                           
                              Step 4: Improvement of the selection. As the SAR operation on a building proceeds, new information can be collected from cameras carried by team members and used to enrich the point cloud data. Using this additional information, steps 2 and 3 can be repeated incrementally, which may result in selection of a candidate solution that more closely matches the actual conditions.

With the existing state-of-the-art in dynamic structural simulation software, accurate and deterministic simulation of the ‘exact’ collapse mechanism of a given building, bridge or other structure caused by an earthquake is not available. Even small variations in the properties of a structural system (concrete properties, reinforcement details, soil properties, dimensional tolerances) can influence a building’s collapse mechanism and lead to a quite different damage pattern than the one expected assuming an idealized ‘perfect’ construction and a given ground motion record. Therefore, the probability that a single damage pattern created by any collapse engine will accurately and reliably represent the actual response (assuming even that precise ground motions could be known, which is not the case, as discussed above), is extremely low.

However, by creating an extensive solution space with very large numbers of possible solutions, we greatly increase the probability that one or more of the solutions is sufficiently similar to the actual result. The criterion for similarity is that it be close enough to the actual result given by the BIM model of the exterior elements (Step 2) and, if possible, additional data surveyed in real-time on site (Step 4) to provide a model that is useful for SAR teams. The requirement for the collapse result for any single run of the collapse engine is therefore simply that it should be physically possible in accordance with a set of criteria defined by the user. This, together with the fact that the process is “pre calculated”, means that knowing the earthquake parameters, soil conditions or the exact structural properties is unnecessary in order to generate a possible solution.

In the feasibility tests, a dynamic mechanics simulation software called Universal Mechanisms [33] was used to generate possible collapse patterns (a solution space) of the example buildings. This software simulates the kinematic and dynamic behavior of mechanical systems in 3D. It is oriented to solving problems of machines and mechanisms, but it is also used in various structural applications, see for example [34]. The nature of the collapse engine used in the initial feasibility tests reported here imposes limitations in modeling the response of buildings:
                        
                           1.
                           Rigid bodies: the models are composed of rigid bodies connected by joints.

Joint representation: The rigid bodies are connected by joints governed by generalized force–displacement and moment-rotation relations. The relations also take into account rate dependency and dissipative effects. However, because the software is oriented towards mechanical engineering problems, none of the available mechanical joint elements describe the behavior of a real reinforced concrete joints between structural elements. Spring and damper elements were used to represent each joint.

Structural connectivity at failure: The analysis assumes that the elements do not break and that the joints do not disassemble at any point during the response.

Considering these technical limitations, not all possible damage patterns can be simulated using UMLAB. The representation of the bodies and joints as explained above makes it possible to simulate a certain class of possible collapse mechanisms which contain mostly damage to the joints and very little damage to the structural elements in terms of bending, shearing, breaking or separation of the elements. Such simulation corresponds to collapse mechanisms of the type observed in Fig. 3
                     . More advanced non-linear structural analysis tools are available, such as those based on the Finite Elements Method or the Applied Element Method, which make it possible to simulate the continuum and discrete behavior of structures (e.g. [35]). A sophisticated engine might first apply linear elastic analysis to predict first locations of failure, and consequently the complete collapse mechanism could be described via the null-space of the stiffness matrix [36]. However, for the purpose of testing the basic feasibility of the proposed approach, the limitations placed on the structural modeling and simulation by the use of UMLAB are acceptable because, within the limits of those assumptions, the solutions generated are physically possible.

The matching process and evaluation of each candidate solution in the solution space for similarity to the actual observed collapse is the heart of this work. In this process, a single solution, or a small group of solutions, that best describes the real damage pattern of the building, is selected from the solution space. Therefore, the similarity function attributes a measure (or index) to each solution in the space. The solutions are then graded based on those measures. A range of similarity functions was tested for the matching process. All of the functions are composed of two basic component functions. The first uses a least sum of point distances (L2 norm of the vectorised difference) and the second is based on the Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC) algorithm [38].

The first candidate function is based on the sum of the differences in location between each element in its position in the model derived from the scan to the corresponding element in its position in each candidate solution. The relative difference in location of the ith
                      element is the sum of the distances between significant points on the element. Three points were used for linear elements (beams and columns) and five points for plate elements (walls and slabs), as shown in Figs. 4 and 5
                     
                     . Thus the similarity measure Zk
                      for the kth
                      candidate solution in the solution space is given by:

                      is the L
                     2 norm, and the bold lettering designates a vector. The “best” candidate solution is the solution whose similarity measure has the smallest rather than the greatest numerical value. Note that the choice of the number of points along the element determines the relative weight of translation versus rotations. For example, the use of two points only for linear elements would give less weight to the translation component than the use of three points does.

The second function is based on the Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC). The original MAC algorithm was devised for estimating the accuracy of experimental modal vectors and was initiated from an orthogonality check [38]. In this case we seek to minimize the generalized angle between each linear element in the model derived from the scan to the corresponding element in the corresponding candidate solution. Note that only linear elements are used in this formulation. In this case the similarity measure, Zk
                     , for the kth candidate solution is given by:

                     are vectors representing the ith
                      element in the model derived from the scan and in the kth
                      candidate solution, respectively, and the dot is the scalar product operator.

As an initial test of suitability for purpose, the similarity functions were first tested using a model of a simple frame. The frame consists of two concrete columns of 2m height and 300×400mm rectangular cross section and a 3m long beam between the tops of the columns with 300×400mm rectangular cross section. A ground motion adapted from the work of [29] was applied to the simulation, with different combinations of motion in the global X direction and in the global Y direction, to generate five different damage or collapse patterns. One of these damage patterns was randomly chosen to represent the ‘actual’ damage of the frame (representing the exterior BIM model that would be derived in full scale implementation – see Fig. 6
                     ). The remaining four damage patterns comprised the ‘solution space’, as shown in Fig. 7
                     .

This simple structure provides the opportunity to test initial applicability of the proposed functions, the different possible ways to implement each of them, and the relative effect of the different possible geometric parameters that can be used (such as consideration of vertical structural elements alone, horizontal elements alone, or use of both but with different weightings). A series of different compositions of the components of the function were tested. They can all be formulated as follows:

The results for all of the candidate similarity functions designate Solution 1 as the most similar to the ‘actual’ collapse model, because it has the lowest Z value in all cases. As can be seen by comparing Fig. 6 with Fig. 7, this is the expected result. This implies that solution 1 most closely approximates the damage pattern representing a model derived from the scan.

In all the calculations, the same candidate solution was identified at the highest degree of similarity. Moreover, the degree of differentiation (measured as the number of standard deviations from the median value to the solution value in each similarity function result set) is greatest for similarity function 1, although the differences are relatively small. This shows that for this simple frame, there is no clear benefit to differential weighting of the horizontal or vertical elements, nor is there any apparent advantage to the MAC component over the L
                     2 norm component in the similarity function.

The simple frame model test case described in the previous section is limited to three simple objects forming a two dimensional frame. It contains no internal elements, and therefore it does not test the ability to predict the behavior of the whole structure based on input data for external elements only, as envisioned in the overall system concept (described in Section 3). A three dimensional structure, with two floors and 39 elements, was modeled and used for a second test case. The model was created using Autodesk Revit Structure 2012 software taking into account the criteria for the numerical experiment and the specific limitations and requirements of the collapse engine. These include the following:
                        
                           (a)
                           The frame model should contain at least two stories. This enables testing of the hypothesis that the higher points of a structure will have more influence on the degree of similarity than the lower points, given that the first story columns stay fixed to the ground in their original locations.

The frame model must contain interior elements that would not be visible in a scan performed from outside the building. The basic idea of this work is that if a collapse candidate model has a pattern of external elements that is similar to that of the real damage (collapse) pattern, it will approximately describe also the internal elements. In order to test this idea, the model must contain both exterior and interior elements.

Spaces (gaps) must be provided between structurally connected elements for insertion of dampened spring joint connectors.

The Revit model is shown in Fig. 8
                     . Along with the characteristics outlined above, it is evident that the lateral stiffening system of the structures is somewhat deficient. This system, which is solely based on the frame action simulated through the links at the joints, aims to look at a structural system that is inherently vulnerable to lateral base excitation. The Revit was then imported to the collapse engine and an impulse type ground movement of 10s duration was applied to it using UMLAB. In order to create a large solution space that includes ground motion impulses spread through 360° and a range of magnitudes, a set of multiplier factor values was applied to the ground movement values in the X direction and in the Y direction. The X and Y multiplier factors each ranged in value from −2.0 to 2.0 with 25 interval values, thus creating a total of 625 alternative ground motion patterns. Generation of each solution and storage of the results required some 30min on a PC with an Intel Core i3-2.53GHz processor.

Because a post event BIM of this model is not available, one of the 625 candidate solutions was randomly chosen to represent the real damage (collapse) pattern of the building generated from the scan. Therefore, this model contains both interior and exterior geometry. Given that information about the interior elements of a “real” damage pattern of a building is not available, the candidate solutions can be evaluated in two ways; either using information about exterior elements only, (as would be done when using a post-disaster BIM which contains only the envelope of the building), or using information about the whole building. The second reference case is, of course, a hypothetical one and it is only used for the sake of testing the algorithm. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, the ability of the two procedures to lead to the same candidate solution with the highest degree of similarity is examined.

In this case, Zk
                      values are computed using Eq. (3) in three combinations:
                        
                           (A)
                           
                              Wh
                              /hf
                              =0.5, Wv
                              /vf
                              =0.5, Wθ
                              /n
                              =0 and using information about all of the elements (interior and exterior). This combination – with all elements – cannot occur in the envisaged future operation of the approach, because the position of the interior elements is not determined by the laser scan. It is computed in order to provide a reference benchmark for the assessment of the following two combinations.


                              Wh
                              /hf
                              =0.5, Wv
                              /vf
                              =0.5, Wθ
                              /n
                              =0 and using information about exterior elements only. This combination simulates the real case but only uses the L
                              2 norm terms.


                              Wh
                              /hf
                              =0, Wv
                              /vf
                              =0, Wθ
                              /n
                              =1 using information about the exterior vertical elements only (note that in this case, n in Eq. (4) is replaced with v). Given the assumption that the model contains rigid bodies that do not break or separate, this combination assumes that the location of the columns defines the whole geometry of the model.

The results are given in Table 2
                     . Both combinations (A) and (B) determine candidate solution 131 as the solution with the highest degree of similarity to the one that represents the real damage pattern. On the other hand in combination C candidate solution number 106 was identified as the solution with the highest degree of similarity. Candidate solution 131 was ranked second using this calculation; solution 106 was ranked fourth in combinations A and B. The solutions are illustrated in Fig. 9
                     ; both solution 131 and solution 106 approximately describe the solution representing the real damage pattern.

A second test case was created using the same model and solution space simply by choosing a different candidate solution to represent the real damage pattern of the building (Fig. 10
                     ). Evaluation of the candidate solutions was performed again using the same three similarity functions. In this case, both types of function, those based on minimum distances (A and B) and that based on MAC (C), result in selection of the same candidate solution as the one with the highest degree of similarity to the solution representing the real damage pattern. The results are given in Table 3
                     . The solution chosen to represent the real case and the solution selected by the algorithm are shown in Fig. 10.

The significance of these results is twofold. First, the selections using exterior elements only produced the same result (or a very similar one) as the reference selection using all of the building elements. This supports and demonstrates the basic idea behind the proposed approach, which is that a reasonable estimate of the collapsed state can be made based on information about the exterior of the building after the event.

Second, both selection function components can provide reasonable results. Given the fact that a perfect solution is not possible (selection is made from a large sample space of collapse states, but the sample space is finite and it cannot be assumed to contain a precise match for the real case), any selection must have some error.

The calculation based on the MAC procedure considers only vertical linear elements and is therefore significantly faster than the calculation based on minimum distances. The time required to evaluate 624 patterns was approximately 15s and 420s for the MAC and minimum distance formulations respectively (using the same PC with an Intel Core i3-2.53GHz processor).

In order to further examine the capability of this approach, it was applied again on the same model, but with the assumption that only partial information about the real damage is available. This would be the case, for example, if access restrictions at the site limited the terrestrial laser scan to just one or two facades, or if there were occlusions. In this test, elements of only two façades were taken into account (only nine exterior vertical elements were taken into account out of a total of 15 exterior vertical elements).

The result of this calculation for the first case also identified candidate solution 106 as the solution with the highest degree of similarity, as can be seen in Table 4
                     . Similarly for the second test case above, the same candidate solution (541) was identified both using the two-façade only data and the whole building data, as can be seen in Table 5
                     . These results suggest that the calculation of the similarity function using the component that aims to minimize the differences in angles between the corresponding elements is not only faster, but is also effective even in cases where only partial external data is available.

These tests do not determine which of the solution functions is more accurate or more reliable; they only show that both solution function components – minimum distances (the L
                     2 criterion) and minimum angles (the MAC criterion) – are feasible as they result in the most appropriate selections when considering external elements only. In any future practical implementation, speed of computation may be the deciding factor in choosing which component to use, particularly since very large sets of pre-computed solutions may be needed. Although the sample space of candidate collapse solutions is computed in advance of the earthquake, the selection calculations must be performed during the critical time of first response, once the external element BIM model based the scan of the actual collapsed building becomes available. Thus the calculation process should be as rapid as possible.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The idea behind this work is to provide information about the internal geometry of a damaged building in a very short time. It is intended as a complementing alternative to the time-consuming and dangerous practice in which rescuers enter the building to collect information. The overall concept, which uses an external BIM model and a collapse engine to generate a full BIM model of the structure, defines the innovative step taken in this work. In the light of its innovative nature, the scope of the research was limited to demonstration of the basic feasibility of the approach, and used relatively simple tools.

Given that scans or BIM models of actual buildings with recent earthquake damage were not available, sample collapsed building models were simulated using the collapse engine in order to demonstrate the proposed method. A single collapse pattern was extracted from the set and represented the candidate actual collapse. This model therefore contained the exterior and interior elements. In this way it was possible to demonstrate the proposed method and to show its initial feasibility.

Three cases were generated to illustrate the method. The first case, a simulation of a simple frame structure, was used for preliminary testing, with emphasis on the compatibility of the chosen collapse engine software and on the algorithms proposed for the matching process. The solution space in this case was limited to five candidate solutions, one of which was chosen to represent the real damage pattern of the structure. Different similarity functions were then used to calculate the degree of similarity of each candidate solution to the solution representing the real damage model. In this case all of the functions identified the same candidate solution as having highest degree of similarity to the real damage model. Parameters that proportioned the relative weights of vertical vs. horizontal elements in the solution functions appeared to have weak effect. Similarly, the components of the similarity functions based on relative distances provided the same results. The functions based on the relative angles component and the MAC algorithm, also selected solutions similar to the real collapse case.

The second and third cases used a more complex model that included both external and internal elements and represents a seismically deficient design. Because the real damage pattern of the building was represented by a randomly chosen candidate solution, information about the external and internal geometry was available, which made it possible to perform the matching process in two ways: once relying on information about the external elements only (as would be the case when using a post-event scan that contains information only about the envelope of the building); and once relying on information about the whole building, thus providing a reference benchmark for the assessment of the method.

The three cases were evaluated with similarity functions that used both the relative distance and the relative angle measures to compare elements in the original state with elements in the deformed state. In all cases the same candidate solution was identified at the highest degree of similarity when calculated based on external elements alone as well as when based on the whole building. Calculations based on different algorithms may lead to identification of different similar candidate solutions as the solution with the highest degree of similarity, yet nevertheless, in all cases, the solutions identified at the highest degrees of similarity represent the real damage pattern of the building well.

Whereas the collapse engine used in the research (the UMLAB application) required some 30min to compute each collapse case for the more complex structure tested, the selection procedure required approximately 25s only to evaluate all 624 collapse case patterns. This separation of processing time, with the bulk performed before the earthquake, and only selection left to be performed once the scan and exterior BIM are available, is therefore essential. Together with the successful technical demonstration of the solution space generation and the selection algorithms, this illustrates the feasibility of the proposed approach and justifies pursuit of larger-scale testing.

The computational performance of the collapse engine and the computer hardware used in these tests limited the number of model elements. The model used in the research therefore included only structural elements, with no partitions, infrastructure, furniture etc. In larger-scale tests or prototypical implementations of such a system, a number of improvements could be made that would increase the accuracy and the usefulness of the results:
                        
                           •
                           a more sophisticated structural collapse engine could be used;

given that collapse computations are performed before the disaster, a very much larger sample space of candidate collapse cases could be generated;

collapse cases could include non-structural building system components, such as HVAC ducts, major water and other pipes, large furnishings and acoustic ceilings. These, and their attachments to the structure, are commonly modeled in as-built BIM models, and there is no technical barrier to modeling them in the collapse engine.

There are a number of technological and commercial barriers to implementation of a practical tool for use at collapse sites. The technological barriers include the inadequacy of existing collapse computation engines and the scope of the existing algorithms for scanning and compiling façade BIM models:
                        
                           1.
                           Current collapse engines are inadequate. A software is needed that can reliably model the dynamic behavior of a building during an earthquake, including physical breaks and separation of component parts.

The algorithms and software developed thus far for scanning and compiling the initial exterior façade BIM model only deal with the case of reinforced concrete framed buildings with unreinforced masonry (URM) walls. Similar tools will be needed for other classes of buildings.

Another barrier is the small number of existing buildings for which BIM models of the as-built state are available. In developed economies, the use of BIM is gradually becoming mandated by government construction and permitting agencies, so that the availability of BIM models is likely to grow. While modern buildings for which BIM models are available are more likely to withstand earthquakes, their survival cannot be guaranteed, and they may also be damaged in other catastrophic events. Where buildings are only moderately or lightly damaged, reconstructed BIM models of their damaged states will prove highly useful, if not for SAR, then for damage assessment and repair. For older buildings – which are the great majority of the building stock in developed economies – preparation of ‘as-built’ BIM models offers an inexpensive first-step in improving SAR and management of disasters, whether due to earthquakes or other causes. This is particularly true for high occupancy public buildings such as schools and hospitals. This may also be the case in less developed economies or where physical retrofit of existing buildings is not financially possible.

The solution approach developed and tested in this work is an innovative attempt to derive a tool capable of providing detailed information about the voids formed in a damaged building to support search and rescue operations. The results show the potential for development of future technological solutions that adopt the computational approach to provide useful information for search and rescue operations in buildings in which there is reason to believe that survivors may be trapped in void spaces. The system as envisaged would be used by individual SAR teams to reduce risk and make their work more effective.

In the proposed method a BIM model of a building before deformation is used in a suitable “collapse engine” to create a large solution set of different possible collapse patterns of the building. Each collapse pattern contains the exterior and interior geometry of the deformed state of the building. The idea behind this process is that once the actual post-disaster exterior BIM model becomes available, the most appropriate single solution (or small group of solutions) that will approximately describe the real deformed shape of the building can be identified from the set of candidate solutions. Selection is based on the BIM model generated from the scan, which contains information about the exterior elements of the building in their deformed state.

The primary contribution of this research lies in the computational approach to the challenging problem of providing valuable engineering information that cannot be obtained using any existing approach. Its key features are (a) compilation of the potential collapse/damage patterns prior to the disaster due to the high computational load and (b) minimization of the processing time required for pattern matching during the search and rescue effort, where time is of the essence. The feasibility of both of these steps has been demonstrated using available tools. Each of these could be significantly improved and scaled, primarily through use of better collapse engines. The computational approach is relevant for use cases beyond the earthquake search and rescue scenario, such as evaluation of landslide scenarios (based on pre-processed analytical scenarios and scans of the resulting landscape) or forensic studies of various processes that result in structural damage.

Further research is needed in a number of areas. Given the technical limitations of the tools used so far, initial feasibility was demonstrated for simple framed structures with damage restricted to the rotational failure of the joints. A similar examination should be conducted on other building types and for other, more complex and more realistic possible damage types. Issues like the relationship between the number of candidate solutions and the accuracy as well as the uniqueness of the solution that can be obtained in the selection process also remain to be explored. The numerical experiments demonstrated that different similarity functions may identify different candidate solutions with the highest degree of similarity, but they did not indicate which of the solutions is more useful for SAR efforts – independent criteria for accuracy would be useful.
