                  We consider a class of multi-objective probabilistically constrained programs (MOPCP) with a joint probabilistic constraint and a variable risk level. We consider two cases with only a random right-hand side vector or a multi-row random technology matrix, and propose a Boolean modeling framework to derive new mixed-integer linear programs (MILP) that are either equivalent reformulations or inner approximations of MOPCP, respectively. Via testing randomly generated MOPCP instances, we demonstrate modeling insights pertaining to the most suitable MILP, to the trade-offs between conflicting objectives of cost/revenue and reliability, and to the parameter scalarization determining relative importance of each objective. We then focus on several MOPCP variants of a multi-portfolio financial optimization problem to implement a downside risk measure, which can be used in a centralized or decentralized investment context. We study the impact of modeling parameters on the portfolios, show, via a cross-validation study, robustness of MOPCP, and perform a comparative analysis of the optimal investment decisions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper, we focus on a new class of multi-objective stochastic programming problems (see Stancu-Minasian, 1984). The problems consider a constraint that requires a system of r inequalities to hold jointly with probability p. The probability level p, often used to characterize the quality of service level or reliability target, is defined as a continuous decision variable between 0 and 1. We optimize a decision vector

                      hold jointly with reliability at least equal to p. The notation 
                        P
                      refers to a probability measure. In contrast to traditional probabilistically-constrained programs, p is defined as a decision variable representing a reliability level, which is lower-bounded by the lowest acceptable reliability level 
                        p
                      .

Optimizing investments over multiple portfolios is complex and increasingly needed in a variety of contexts. Some considered multi-portfolio financial optimization as the “natural next step in portfolio optimization theory” (see Savelsbergh, Stubbs, & Vandenbussche, 2010). The main difficulty is to hedge against the risk of potential losses in multiple and possible interrelated portfolios. Decision makers’ preferences about the tradeoff between cost and potential risk of multiple losses are often unclear under random investment returns. A Pareto analysis is a common way to handle multi-objective programming. However, in the multi-portfolio optimization context, it is difficult to conduct multi-dimensional Pareto analysis and derive the corresponding efficient frontier when there are more than one uncertain outcomes with different risk levels to measure.

Other than multi-portfolio optimization, the proposed MOPCP models have a wide range of applications. For instance, we can interpret p in the above two MOPCPs as the reliability of a quality control process (Olson, 1990) or the quality of service provided to customers (Lejeune & Ruszczyński, 2007). As the reliability p increases, the probability of losing customers and the related loss of goodwill become lower, leading to a potential increase of the overall benefits of a company. However, a larger p may trigger additional resources required and raise additional operational and management costs. A decision maker aims to trade off between the above two consequences.


                        Ang and De Leon (1996) advocate the use of a multi-objective stochastic programming model to decide whether an existing infrastructure for earthquake protection should be upgraded. They use a weighted objective function accounting for the degree of structural damage caused by earthquake, the cost of upgrading versus potential losses due to damages, and interpret p as a target reliability level for damage control and life safety. In this paper, we assume that the reliability component η(p) of the objective function is linear in p, and the objective (1) is specified as 
                           
                              
                                 q
                                 ⊤
                              
                              x
                              +
                              a
                              p
                              ,
                           
                         where a > 0 is the scalarization parameter that defines a proper balance between the profit and reliability objectives (see, e.g., Ehrgott & Gandibleux, 2002; Miettinen, 1999). The determination of the optimal functional form for η(p) is problem-dependent and is a complicated issue beyond the scope of this study.

The first MOPCP, in which cost and reliability are two components of a scalarized objective function, is due to Evers (1967). Sengupta and Portillo-Campbell (1973) propose a probabilistically-constrained production scheduling model with reliability levels considered as decision variables. Prékopa (1995) underlines the difficulty of solving multi-objective probabilistically constrained formulations and suggests a parametric approximation approach, which requires recursively solving an MOPCP variant with fixed p and choosing the best solution obtained during the iterative process. Morgan, Eheart, and Valocchi (1993) propose a probabilistically-constrained formulation to trade off between pumping cost and reliability of an aquifer network. Rengarajan and Morton (2009) and Rengarajan, Dimitrov, and Morton (2013) analyze the tradeoffs between the cost of building a network and the probability of an adversarial event causing a network failure, both of which motivate the use of MOPCPs in order to comprehend the risk tradeoff in network applications.

Another motivation for studying MOPCPs stems from the prevalence of various hidden costs (e.g., reputation damage) associated with the value of p, which are not necessarily taken into account in probabilistically-constrained programming models with fixed reliability level. Chapman and Harwood (2011) as well as Sullivan and Kida (1995) suggest that the risk faced by a company and the one faced by its managers may need separate consideration as manager’s reputation might suffer from a highly visible mistake. The function η(p) can then be used to capture the manager’s reputation objective related to the reliability level p. The function η(p) can also represent a company’s long-term reputation or brand name modeled as an increasing function of p that represents the quality of service delivered to the customers. Under this context, our objective function combines a short-term profit q
                        ⊤
                        x goal with the long-term brand name objective. Alternatively, η(p) gives the flexibility of violating the stochastic inequalities in (2) or (4) with a variable probability level at most equal to 
                           
                              (
                              1
                              −
                              p
                              )
                           
                        . The impact of the violation depends on the value of p and may significantly affect decision quality, especially in highly uncertain environments (e.g., high-tech industries including oil drilling and renewable energy investment) where optimal decisions are sensitive with respect to p. Shen (2014) studies probabilistically-constrained programs with the reliability guarantees being considered as decision variables. This preliminary study only assumes individual probabilistic constraints with 
                           
                              r
                              =
                              1
                              ,
                           
                         yielding much simpler modeling mechanisms and solution schemes.

In this paper, we develop new formulations, as well as methods for solving the MOPCPs. A key contribution is to show, through a sensitivity analysis, the effect of varying the risk level p. Via an extensive set of computational tests, we analyze the interplay between the objectives and provide insights about the marginal rate of substitution of reliability for revenue. We assess the solution sensitivity with respect to the parameter a defining the relative importance of each objective, which provides guidance to choose the value of a.

From the financial optimization viewpoint, we propose a series of new stochastic multi-objective, multi-portfolio optimization models. This study could be a cornerstone for subsequent developments in the multi-portfolio financial optimization. The multi-portfolio financial optimization models balance return with downside risk. They can be used in a centralized fashion (i.e., one generalist manager has a balanced mandate across asset classes) or a decentralized one (i.e., specialized managers each have a mandate for a particular asset class). We also derive reformulations for these models that can be efficiently solved. Finally, we analyze the effect of the different parameters (tolerated loss levels, scalarization parameter, capital allocated to each sub-portfolio) on the composition of the sub-portfolios and compare the decentralized and centralized financial investment approaches.

We demonstrate that the proposed reformulations are equivalent to MOPCP-V with random right-hand sides and are inner approximations for MOPCP-M when the technology matrix is random. Further, we identify a series of general conditions for variants of MOPCP-M under which the reformulations are equivalent. A discrete representation of the uncertainty with a set of joint scenarios is frequently employed (see, e.g., Dentcheva, Prékopa, & Ruszczyński, 2000; Ruszczyński, 2002), which permits to take into account dependencies among random variables, and can be derived by sampling from some underlying distributions of the random variables. While algorithmic methods have been proposed for single-objective stochastic problems including a joint probabilistic constraint with random right-hand sides (e.g., Dentcheva et al., 2000; Küçükyavuz, 2012; Lejeune, 2012a), and, most recently, with multi-row random technology matrix (Beraldi & Bruni, 2010; Kogan & Lejeune, 2014), no efficient reformulations or solution methods have been developed, to the best of our knowledge, for the class of multi-objective stochastic programming problems considered in this study.

It is important to note that our approach does not require solving multiple probabilistically constrained programs with a set of acceptable fixed values of p to approximate solutions to MOPCP. This is in contrast with studies that perform a Pareto analysis of the “efficient frontier” for chance-constrained programs. Two representative articles Rengarajan et al. (2013); Rengarajan and Morton (2009) are reviewed above, where the authors vary the values of p in the corresponding probabilistic constraints and compute the corresponding objective q
                        ⊤
                        x. Mitra, Gudi, Patwardhan, and Sardar (2008) use a similar approach to construct the efficient frontier of a probabilistically-constrained supply chain planning problem in which the objectives are related to cost and demand satisfaction rate. Analyze the impact of changing p in probabilistically-constrained programs with recourse variables by constructing the response space frontier using generalized Lagrangian duality. All these studies require solving a probabilistically-constrained program for a sufficiently large number of reliability choices, whereas we provide a nonparametric approach that simultaneously determines the optimal values of x and p by directly solving reformulations of MOPCP.

We further point out two more advantages of using our approach as an alternative to the aforementioned Pareto analysis. First, the normalized parameter a in the objective function 
                           
                              
                                 q
                                 ⊤
                              
                              x
                              +
                              a
                              p
                           
                         defines relatively weights assigned to each objective item. Therefore, decision makers can specify their own trade-off preferences, e.g., ratios between the cost and all risk-related objectives, to obtain the corresponding optimal x and p through our model. Second, in practice there may be more than one uncertain outcomes that need to be probabilistically guaranteed, and thus more than one probabilistic constraints. It results in multiple reliability levels to be traded off with the cost, and a multi-dimensional Pareto analysis becomes complicated, making it difficult to demonstrate the shape of the efficient frontier. Our model can help decision makers who need to obtain optimal operational solutions and risk-level choices more easily. Indeed, the above trade-offs among several random outcomes often arise in multi-portfolio financial optimization, which is the a key motivation for this study.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 revisits some fundamental Boolean concepts first introduced in (Kogan & Lejeune, 2014; Lejeune, 2012a) and the Boolean reformulation method for probabilistically-constrained programs. Section 3 derives new equivalent MILP reformulations for MOPCP-V with random right-hand side vector and variable p, while Section 4 is devoted to MOPCP-M with random technology matrix and variable p. Section 5 compares the computational tractability of the proposed formulations, and presents insights on the trade-offs between different objectives and solution sensitivity. Section 6 contains a comprehensive analysis of stochastic multi-portfolio models that can be used in decentralized and centralized investment contexts. Section 7 concludes the paper.

The Boolean method was first introduced to handle joint probabilistic constraints with dependent random right-hand sides (Lejeune, 2012a). It was also used in Lejeune (2012b) to elicit the exhaustive list of p-efficient points (see, e.g., Prékopa, 1995), represented as combinatorial ep
                     -patterns, through solutions of an MILP reformulation. Most recently, the method was employed for probabilistically-constrained programs with multi-row random technology matrix (Kogan & Lejeune, 2014). We shall here expand the method for MOPCPs with random technology matrix and random right-hand side vector with variable risk levels.

To be self-contained, we present succinctly the Boolean modeling framework that defines the satisfiability of a joint probabilistic constraint in terms of a partially defined Boolean function (pdBf). Here we describe the Boolean modeling approach for the random matrix ξ in constraint (4) for MOPCP-M. The same procedure applies to the easier case of the random vector ζ in (2) for MOPCP-V, for which we omit the details in this section.

The Boolean method involves the construction of the set of recombinations and the binarization of the probability distribution with a set of cut points. Let Ω be the set of all realizations (scenarios)

We shall now binarize the probability distribution and the recombinations using the concept of cut points. The binarization process permits to represent constraint (4) as a partially defined Boolean function and to subsequently model its satisfiability with sets of mixed-integer linear inequalities derived by using the concept of minorant of a threshold Boolean function. The number of binary variables in the inequalities is equal to the number of cut points and is typically order of magnitude smaller than the number of joint possible realizations of the random variables.

                         be the number of cut points associated with the random variable ξij

                                 is feasible for MOPCP-V.
                              

Any solution feasible for MIO-V has a reliability level at least equal to 
                              p
                            and is therefore feasible for MOPCP-V. The optimal value of MIO-V is a lower bound of the optimal value of MOPCP-V. Next, we continue building on Lemma 1 and Theorem 2 to obtain equivalent reformulations of MOPCP-V. We use MIO-V as the backbone formulation in which additional constraints (see Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3) are introduced.

                                 is equivalent to EMP1-V and thus MOPCP-V.
                              

The proof is given in Appendix A.4. Note that the elimination of the implied constraints in (15) and their replacement by (18)–(19) significantly reduce the number of constraints in the MILP formulation.

We can use the concept of Special Ordered Set Variables of Type One (SOS1) to obtain equivalent reformulations for the problems presented in the previous sub-sections. The SOS1-based reformulations are derived in Appendix B. Similar procedures can be applied to the case of MOPCP-M, resulting in SOS1-based reformulations also given in Appendix B.

Probabilistically constrained programs with random technology matrix are notoriously more complex to reformulate and solve than their counterparts with random right-hand sides. In this section, we show that there is a connection between the feasible sets of probabilistically-constrained problems with random right-hand sides on one hand and with random technology matrix on the other. We exploit this link and the results in Section 3 to derive MILP reformulations of the joint probabilistic constraint (4) in MOPCP-M where the technology matrix involves random variables

                     . We follow procedures similar to those presented in Section 3 to derive MILP reformulations whose solutions are always feasible for MOPCP-M and constitute inner approximations of MOPCP-M. We also demonstrate that under a series of general conditions the proposed MILP reformulations are equivalent to MOPCP-M.

We use an MOPCP-M instance with three decision variables and a two-row random technology matrix to illustrate how the Boolean method reformulates the satisfiability of the probabilistic constraint as a pdBf.

The proof of Theorem 6 is given in Appendix A.5. We provide in Appendix C.2 the system S1 of mixed-integer quadratic inequalities for Example 1.

The above system S1 provides an inner approximation for MOPCP-M for the general case. Next, we describe a few special cases when the two formulations are equivalent.

We provide in Appendix A.7 a detailed proof. Note that S1 is not linear. We propose several approaches for linearizing the bilinear terms λijlxj
                         in constraints (24). We first use the inequalities proposed by McCormick (1976). Note that each term contains a binary variable λijl
                         and a nonnegative continuous variable xj
                        . Define

The proof of Lemma 3 is provided in Appendix A.6.

We propose in Lemma 4 (directly implied by Lemma 3) an MILP formulation, whose solutions are feasible for MOPCP-M with variable p ≥ 
                           p
                         . Note that instead of S3 given in Lemma 3, we could rely upon S1 and S2 for deriving equivalent formulations.

                              is feasible for MOPCP-M. The optimal value of MIO-M is a lower bound of the optimal value of MOPCP-M.
                           

Any solution feasible for MIO-M has a reliability level at least equal to 
                           p
                         and is therefore feasible for MOPCP-M. Next, we build on Lemma 4 to obtain equivalent reformulations for MOPCP-M in which p is a decision variable.

Using the results presented in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3, we derive new MILP formulations for problem MOPCP-M with variable reliability level p. The results are summarized in Theorem 8. The proof follows similar procedures as the ones described for the theorems given in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3.

                              are inner approximations of problem MOPCP-M.
                           

Their SOS1-based reformulations are provided in Appendix B. Following Theorem 7, if the set of stochastic inequalities in (4) takes one of the forms (i)–(vi) defined in the theorem, then the MILP formulations EMP1-M and EMP2-M become equivalent to MOPCP-M.

The MILP reformulations of MOPCP-V and MOPCP-M have two most remarkable features. First, the number of binary variables in EMP1-V or EMP1-M is not an increasing function of the number of scenarios and is typically much smaller than the latter. Second, the number of binary variables is equal to the number of cut points used in the binarization process. This means that the MILP reformulations of the multi-objective stochastic problems MOPCP-V and MOPCP-M have the same number of binary variables as the MILP reformulations of the single-objective (i.e., p fixed) probabilistically-constrained problems studied in Lejeune (2012a) and Kogan and Lejeune (2014).

In this section, we focus on the more general and complex model MOPCP-M with random coefficients ξij
                      for each variable xj
                      in constraint row i, for all

                      and 
                        
                           j

                     . We evaluate the computational performance of models EMP1-M, EMP2-M, EMP1-M-SOS1, and EMP2-M-SOS1 by testing a set of randomly generated instances. The goals are (i) to demonstrate and compare the efficacy of the EMP formulations and (ii) to examine the impact of changing the relative weights attributed to the multiple objectives (i.e., revenue and reliability in MOPCP models).

Intuitively, EMP2-M formulations improve EMP1-M formulations by eliminating many redundant constraints and variables, which could lead to CPU time reduction. The sizes of all our MILP reformulations depend on the values of r, m, and the number of cut points (e.g.,

                        EMP1-M, in which the integrality restrictions on variables α are relaxed, solves all instances within ten minutes. We achieve significant average, minimum and maximum CPU time reduction when using EMP2-M in which the redundant constraints of form (67) are removed. This illustrates the computational benefits obtained by preprocessing and eliminating the redundant linear constraints and by reducing the number of binary decision variables. EMP1-M-SOS1 and EMP2-M-SOS1 do not further reduce solution times, and even take slightly more time than their counterparts EMP1-M and EMP2-M. As it is shown to be the most efficient formulation, we will employ formulation EMP2-M in Section 6 for solving the multi-portfolio optimization problems.

Keeping the same objective function and constraints, we directly solve a straightforward MILP reformulation of MOPCP-M, denoted by MILP1, after replacing the joint probabilistic constraint (4) in MOPCP-M with the following set of MILP constraints

We solve EMP2-M and MILP1 for the nine generated instances. We allow 1800 seconds of CPU time for each instance and reformulation. Before comparing the results obtained with the two reformulations, we recall that MILP1 is a reformulation equivalent to MOPCP-M, while our MILP reformulation EMP2-M is an inner approximation. Therefore, the optimal value of EMP2-M is a lower bound (i.e., maximization problem) of the optimal value of MOPCP-M and of MILP1.

The following observations appear. First, the EMP2-M reformulation of each instance is solved very fast and takes on average 8.74 seconds. All EMP2-M reformulations are solved to optimality within less than 20 seconds. Second, the time needed to find the best solution with EMP2-M is on average 29.36 times smaller than the time needed to find the best possible with MINLP1. This confirms the high computational efficiency of the reformulation EMP2-M. Finally, besides being obtained much faster, the solution found with EMP2-M is always better than the solution found with MINLP1. On average, the best solution found with EMP2-M is 6.13 percent better than the MINLP1 best solution. This is the most noticeable result as EMP2-M is an inner approximation while MINLP1 is an equivalent reformulation.

                        x
                        * are both unchanged corresponding to each interval. We present two key observations. First, the ratios of revenue changes to the changes of optimal reliability levels (indicated in the last row of Table 4) fluctuate as we increase τ. Similar fluctuating patterns are observed in the other nine instances we tested, for which there are generally between 5 and 7 ranges of values for τ leading to a different optimal value of reliability p
                        *. In all instances, the revenue q
                        ⊤
                        x
                        * decreases sharply when the worst-case scenario is considered and a 100 percent reliability level is enforced. The tradeoff between revenue and reliability fluctuates significantly for various values of τ, emphasizing the importance of studying MOPCPs. Second, when p
                        * is relatively low (close to 75 percent), a 1 percent change of p
                        * results in a small reduction in the optimal revenue q
                        ⊤
                        x
                        *. The reduction becomes more significant as p
                        * increases (i.e., p* ∈ [0.8, 0.85]), but becomes small again as p
                        * continues increasing and takes its values in [0.85, 0.95]. The revenue reduction rate ultimately becomes very large when the optimal reliability p
                        * is required to be close to 100 percent. These results highlight the sensitivity of the revenue to the level of reliability p
                        *. The revenue is, without surprise, a decreasing function of the reliability level. More interestingly, the amount by which the revenue decreases due to a 1 percent-change in reliability appears to vary tremendously at different reliability levels and to be a highly nonlinear and non-monotone function of the optimal p
                        *. The models proposed in this study permit to identify the “sensitivity zones” of the optimal reliability level on the revenue. The sensitivity study also provides guidance to set the value of the scalarization parameter a and to specify the minimal required reliability level

In this section, we consider the multi-portfolio problem faced by an investment company that manages several funds specialized in diverse asset classes (e.g., bonds, small caps), industrial sectors (e.g., financial, consumer staples), or geographical areas (e.g., Japan, Eurozone, North America). We propose two types of stochastic multi-portfolio models based on a downside risk measure and study their use in two types of investment management approaches, i.e., centralized versus decentralized investment.

Institutional investors (e.g., pension funds) often split their capital among multiple sub-portfolios handled by managers with distinct expertise. The joint optimization of multiple sub-portfolios is appealing, since it offers diversification across strategies, asset classes, and geographic regions, and fund managers with distinct asset class knowledge. Taking full advantage of diversification and access to multiple investment strategies is nontrivial. Savelsbergh et al. (2010) stress the importance of models and algorithms that allows for the integrated optimization of multiple portfolios, which they viewed as the “natural next step in portfolio optimization theory”. We proceed now to a succinct review of the literature devoted to multi-portfolio optimization in finance. Most existing multi-portfolio optimization models are based on the mean-variance framework. Bertsimas, Darnell, and Soucy (1999) use an MILP model to construct a portfolio involving several sub-portfolios. Each of these must replicate the behavior of a target portfolio sharing the same liquidity and expected return, and takes a limited number of positions in order to lessen the annual trading costs. Jaeger, Rausch, and Foley (2010) propose an aggregate multi-portfolio model with various investment time horizons for each sub-portfolio. Their rationale is that a multi-horizon model is appropriate for investors with long-term spending needs and without strong requirements on the present value of future spending. Wang (1999)) derives a bi-objective model for multi-portfolio optimization using multiple benchmarks. Yoda and Prékopa (2010) extends Kataoka’s portfolio selection model (Kataoka, 1963) to incorporate multiple Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraints. They assume that the random variables in different rows of the random technology matrix are independent. Prékopa (2012) examines the properties of the Multivariate Value-at-Risk (MVaR), which is defined as the quantile set of a multivariate probability distribution. He develops an algorithm to generate the MVaR in the case of discrete distributions, and also introduces a new multivariate risk measure called Multivariate Conditional Value-at-Risk (MCVaR).

We specify the following notation. The asset universe includes |J| financial securities. Each security j ∈ J has a stochastic return ξj
                         with mean return μj
                         and belongs to one or several of the r
                        * asset classes i. We denote by Ri
                         the set of assets in sub-portfolio i:

                                    =

                                    …
                                    ,
                                    
                                       r
                                       *
                                    
                                 
                              
                              
                                 R
                                 i
                              
                              =
                              J
                           
                        . The asset classes are not required to be disjoint, as a security can be included in more than one specialized funds (e.g., a security can be both a large cap and a consumer staples). The notation xij
                         is the fraction of capital invested in security j by fund i.

With a centralized investment management (Sharpe, 1981) approach, the investment company employs a single generalist manager with a balanced mandate across all asset classes. In the first multi-portfolio model SMPC1, the downside risk measure requires that the loss or negative return of a sub-portfolio i does not exceed a prescribed loss level di
                         with a certain probability p. A distinct value can be assigned to each di
                         depending on the risk-return profile of the corresponding asset class i. The objective function is a weighted summation of the overall expected return of the portfolio of funds and the probability level p with which each sub-portfolio avoids losing more than the specified loss level. The probability level p represents the risk tolerance and the parameter a can be viewed as the marginal rate of substitution of risk or reliability for expected return. Problem SMPC1 is mean-reliability multi-portfolio investment model, in which expected return is traded off with the probability at which losses exceeding a specified amount can be prevented:

                         the constraints (44) guarantee that the entirety of the capital is invested. The downside risk constraint (43) stipulates that the loss incurred by each sub-portfolio i must be at most equal to the loss threshold di
                         with probability level at least p. The second set of inequalities in (43) impose upper-bounds 
                           
                              d

                         on the loss associated with each individual asset j. As the same generalist manager handles all funds, the downside risk constraints takes the form of a joint probabilistic constraint. The constraints (46) do not permit sub-portfolios to have a position in a security not belonging to the asset class they handle. The concentration constraints (45) do not allow that the sum of the positions (across all funds) in security j exceeds an upper bound uj
                         and can be enforced as the management of each sub-portfolio is entrusted to the same manager. Constraint (47) defines the lowest acceptable 
                           p
                         probability level while constraints (48) preclude short-selling.

In the second model SMPC2, the loss level di
                         of each sub-portfolio is a decision variable instead of a fixed parameter. Instead of the expected return, the objective function now includes a component accounting for the weighted loss level

With a decentralized investment management approach (Sharpe, 1981), the investment company relies upon multiple managers, each with a specialist mandate within a particular asset class. Collecting information about specific assets or asset classes and capitalizing on such informational advantage require highly specialized skills. This explains why fund companies can replace generalist balanced managers with managers specialized in a single asset class with the expectation that they will outperform the generalists. Decentralized investment management can even be a necessity for investment companies. In fact, some large clients, such as pension funds, international organizations or educational endowments, sometimes require the capital allocated to a particular asset class to be partitioned among several sub-funds or asset managers (Van Binsbergen, Brandt, & Koijen, 2008). As a consequence, investment firms regularly employ multiple specialized managers (even within the same asset class) in an attempt to diversify investment strategies and reduce diseconomies of scale as funds grow larger (Blake, Rossi, Timmermann, Tonks, & Wermers, 2013). Each specialized fund manager acts on a myopic basis and controls their fund independently of the others. Consequently, the joint probabilistic constraint (43) is replaced by r
                        * joint probabilistic constraints of smaller dimensionality, and p is replaced by the reliability levels

                        The decentralized model SMPD2 is the counterpart of SMPC2.

To illustrate our approach, we consider three sub-portfolios or funds, respectively focused on equities, fixed-income assets, and international securities. The equity sub-portfolio comprises seven securities: a growth large cap domestic equity mutual fund, a value large cap domestic equity mutual fund, a growth small cap domestic equity mutual fund, a value small cap domestic equity mutual fund, an Asian equity fund, a European equity fund, and an emerging market equity fund. The fixed-income sub-portfolio also includes seven securities: a high yield bond fund, a multi-sector bond fund, an emerging markets bond fund, a government bond fund, a world bond fund, an inflation-protected bond fund, and a high yield muni fund. The international securities sub-portfolio includes five funds covering the emerging markets, Europe, and Asia. Table 5
                         lists the securities selected for possible inclusion in each sub-portfolio. The selection of the funds is based on the following criteria. Each fund has a 4- or 5-star Morningstar rating, belongs to Morningstar’s top ten in its fund category, and has a track-record of at least ten years. For each fund, we collect the monthly returns (without missing data) from January 1993 to April 2013. For cross-validation purposes, we split the data into two disjoint subsets. The training set is used to derive the optimal portfolio allocation, while the data in the testing set are not used to derive the optimal investment strategy and are reserved to analyze the robustness of the models and cross-validate the results.

We create 72 problem instances. The forty-eight problem instances constructed for the models SMPC1 and SMPD1 differ in the weight a balancing the relative importance of the objectives, the proportion of capital

                         for each sub-portfolio, we consider two sets of values. In the first one, the equity (resp., fixed-income and international securities) sub-portfolio is required to generate a loss lower than 3 percent (resp., 1.5 percent and 2 percent), while the maximal loss associated to the equity (resp., fixed-income and international securities) sub-portfolio is equal to 4 percent (resp., 2.5 percent and 3 percent) in the second parameter setting.

The numerical experiments conducted in this section have three main objectives. The first one is to assess the applicability and the computational tractability of our reformulation approach to the proposed stochastic multi-portfolio optimization problems. The second one pertains to the derivation of managerial insights related to: (i) the effect of the different parameters on the composition of the sub-portfolios, and (ii) the impact of the decentralized and centralized financial investment approaches on the results obtained with the proposed downside risk multi-portfolio optimization models. The third one is to verify the robustness of the models. To that effect, we carry out a cross-validation analysis to check whether the results obtained on the testing set (data not used to determine the investment strategy) are aligned (in terms of return and reliability) with what is expected from the investment policy built on the basis of the data in the training set.

For each of the seventy-two problem instances, optimality can be proven within 175 seconds (see Table 6
                        ). The optimal solution of the instances associated with the centralized investment approach (i.e., formulations SMPC1 and SMPC2) takes about 133 seconds on average, while the solution of the instances associated with the decentralized investment approach (i.e., formulations SMPD1 and SMPD2) is faster and takes less than one second (i.e., 0.65 second) on average. This is due to the significantly lower number of constraints included in the deterministic reformulations of SMPD1 and SMPD2. Note also that the formulations SMPC1 and SMPD1 in which each

To evaluate the impact of the parameters a, q, and d (for SMPC1 and SMPD1 only), we consider the trios of problem instances that differ only in terms of one single parameter.

The parameter a defines the relative importance of the two objectives (i.e., reliability and return) and has in our experiments a marginal impact on the composition of the optimal portfolios. Among the twenty-four triplets of instances that differ only in terms of the value attributed to a, we observe a difference in the composition of the optimal portfolio in only seven out of the 24 cases. The composition of the portfolios is particularly stable with respect to a for the centralized problem instances. For those, in only two of the sixteen triplets of instances we have a difference in the optimal portfolio when a is modified. Increasing the importance of an objective by up to 20 percent does not appear to be sufficient to have a strong impact on the composition of the portfolio.

                         define the proportion of capital allocated to each sub-portfolio i and have a clear impact on the composition of the portfolio, and on the return and reliability objectives. In almost all cases, the lowest reliability level is obtained when the proportion of capital allocated to the equity sub-portfolio is the largest (i.e., 40 percent). Interestingly, with the SMPC1 decentralized investment model, the expected return that can be achieved is the largest when the proportion of capital allocated to the equity sub-portfolio is the largest.

                         determine the loss that must not be exceeded with a certain probability level. The optimal expected return for SMPC1 and SMPD1 with fixed parameter di
                         is the lowest when the values assigned to di
                         are the largest (except in three instances) and is a consequence of the trade-off between mean return and downside risk. The optimal objective value of SMPC1 and SMPD1 decreases monotonically with the values taken by di
                        . In Tables 7
                         and 8
                        , we refer to the average, smallest, and largest values with the abbreviations AV, SM, and LA.

For both the centralized SMPC1 and decentralized SMPD1 models, the parameter setting leading to the largest objective value is obtained when the weight a is equal to a
                        3 and gives a priority (20 percent more important) to the return objective, when the allowable loss levels are the highest, and when the capital is equally split between the three sub-portfolios.

As above-mentioned, the stochastic multi-portfolio optimization models SMPD1 and SMPD2 for the decentralized investment approach are easier to solve than their counterparts SMPC1 and SMPC2 for the centralized investment approach, since they contain less binary variables and a significantly smaller number of constraints.

In each problem instance, the decentralized approach models generate a higher objective value. Indeed, the optimal objective value of SMPD1 (resp., SMPD2) is always at least equal to the optimal objective value for SMPC1 (resp., SMPC2). This highlights that the decentralized approach models SMPD1 and SMPD2 are less constraining than the centralized approach models SMPC1 and SMPC2. In SMPC1 and SMPC2, the optimization is carried out with respect to the joint probabilistic constraint (43) which is more constraining than the set of constraints (43) included in SMPD1 and SMPD2 ((43) ⇒ (51)). Also, the concentration constraints (45) in SMPC1 and SMPC2 are more restrictive than the ones (52) in SMPD1 and SMPD2. The decentralization of the investment decisions does not permit to impose the same concentration limitations (i.e., at most 20 percent in each security), since some securities can be included in several sub-portfolios managed by different managers.

For forty-five of the forty-eight decentralized problem instances SMPD1 and SMPD2, the optimal portfolio includes at least one position exceeding 20 percent. With SMPD1, the position in the Virtus Emerging Markets Opportunities (resp., Invesco Asia Pacific Growth and Henderson European Focus) fund exceeds the 20 percent threshold 50 percent (resp., 12.5 percent and 45.8 percent) of the time. With SMPD2, the position in the TCW Emerging Markets Income (resp., Henderson European Focus) fund exceeds 20 percent in 2/3 (resp., all) of the instances. This shows that the decentralization approach can lead to concentration and loss of diversification issues as individual managers have hardly any incentive to take into account the correlation of their fund returns with these of other managers (Blake et al., 2013). Elton and Gruber (2004) acknowledge this issue but note that it is possible to overcome, to some extent, the lack of coordination between managers and the ensuing loss of diversification by imposing rules to asset managers and crafting appropriate managerial incentive contracts. Schleifer (1985) adds that the recourse to multiple managers can induce a “yardstick competition” and that the resulting higher effort levels of the managers can further improve their performance.

The return obtained with SMPD1 (resp., SMPD2) is equal or above the expected return obtained with SMPC1 (resp., SMPC2) for 58.33 percent (resp., all) the problem instances. Table 7 shows that the average, lowest, and largest return levels for SMPD1 exceeds those obtained with SMPC1. The objective value obtained with SMPD1 (resp., SMPD2) is strictly larger than the one obtained with SMPC1 (resp., SMPC2) for each problem instance. Clearly, the compositions of the decentralized optimal sub-portfolios differ from these of the centralized optimal sub-portfolios. This corroborates what Sharpe (1981) observed for the mean-variance models, namely that the centralized optimal solution to the mean-variance problem is different from the optimal linear combination of mean-variance efficient portfolios for each specialized manager (see also Van Binsbergen et al. (2008)).

The average, minimal, and maximal loss levels are lower for and SMPD2 than they are for and SMPC2 for each sub-portfolio and for the entire portfolio.

For each problem instance, we use the asset allocation derived by considering the training data only and observe the average return of the portfolio over the testing period and the reliability to obtain such a return level. The proposed models cross-validate well as shown by the following statistics. The reliability requirement is satisfied for all the seventy-two problem instances over the testing period. The proportion of times that the loss of the portfolio is below the prescribed maximal loss level is below 5 percent. For twenty-one (resp., eighteen) of the twenty-four problem instances SMPD1 (resp., SMPC1), the average return over the testing period exceeds the one over the training period. Similarly, for all (resp., eight of) the twelve problem instances SMPD2 (resp., SMPC2), the average return over the testing period exceeds the one over the training period.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We propose a new approach for a class of multi-objective stochastic programming problems. The problems include a joint probabilistic constraint with multi-row random technology matrix or random right-hand side vector. The probability level in the chance constraint is defined as a decision variable. The weighted linear objective function includes a revenue and a reliability component. The scalarization parameter that determines the relative importance of the objectives can be viewed as the marginal rate of substitution of reliability for revenue.

This study will have wide-reaching contributions, as the form MOPCP arises in various problem backgrounds (see, e.g., network reliability (Rengarajan et al., 2013), disaster management (Ang & De Leon, 1996), water management (Morgan et al., 1993), production scheduling (Sengupta & Portillo-Campbell, 1973)), and industrial sectors (see, e.g., siderurgy, finance). On the modeling and algorithmic side, we propose new formulations as well as solution methods for the class of NP-hard multi-objective problems. While a variety of algorithmic methods exist for probabilistically constrained problems, no exact efficient reformulation or solution method is available for the class of problems studied here. We derive new MILP reformulations that are equivalent to problems MOPCP-V with random right-hand side vector and that are inner approximations or equivalent to problems MOPCP-M with multi-row random technology matrix. We identify a series of general conditions for problems of form MOPCP-M under which the proposed MILP formulations are equivalent. A key feature of the approach is that the number of binary variables in the MILP formulations does not depend directly on the number of scenarios, and is equal to the number of cut points used in the binarization. This means that the MILP reformulations of the MOPCP problems have the same problem size and number of binary variables as the reformulations of the standard single-objective probabilistically-constrained problems with random right-hand side vector (Lejeune, 2012a) and with random technology matrix (Kogan & Lejeune, 2014), both having fixed reliability level.

A key motivation to study this class of stochastic optimization problems stems from the multi-portfolio financial optimization area. To our best knowledge, this study is the first to propose stochastic multi-objective, multi-portfolio optimization problems and to derive reformulations for such problems that can be efficiently solved. The proposed multi-portfolio financial optimization models balance return with downside risk, and can be used in a centralized fashion (i.e., one generalist manager has a balanced mandate across asset classes) or a decentralized one (i.e., specialized managers each have a mandate for a particular asset class). The tests show: (i) the applicability of the models and the ability to solve them efficiently; (ii) the effect of the different parameters (tolerated loss levels, scalarization parameter, capital allocated to each sub-portfolio) on the composition of the sub-portfolios; (iii) the possible pros and cons of the decentralized and centralized financial investment approaches; (iv) the robustness of the proposed models.

Our computational study demonstrates modeling insights about the efficiency of the reformulations and about the solution sensitivity with respect to the relative importance of the objectives. The computational times differ greatly among the proposed MILP reformulations. The study provides guidance to select the most appropriate formulation and to specify the value of the scalarization parameter defining the relative importance of the several pursued goals. The results show first that the revenues are a decreasing function of the reliability level. Second, the rate of substitution of revenue for reliability varies strongly with and is a nonlinear and non-monotone function of the optimal reliability level p

                           Proof
                           
                              Lemma 1 indicates that the feasible region of MOPCP-V is defined by constraints (10)–(12) and (13). Therefore, we only need to demonstrate that the new constraints (15)–(17) inserted in EMP1-V enforce (13) without cutting any feasible solution for MOPCP-V, and permit to capture the reliability level corresponding to a solution (x, λ, α) feasible for EMP1-V.

This result, along with part (i) in which it is shown that each variable α will always take value 1 if allowed, explains why the variables α do not have to be defined as binary ones and can be defined on [0, 1] as in (17). It follows that the second term of

                              This implies that if the k′th inequality (64) holds, then the kth inequality (64) is also satisfied.

                           Proof
                           To establish the equivalence between EMP1-V and EMP2-V, we show that constraints (15) are implied by the constraints (18)–(19) in EMP2-V.

First, we observe that constraints (15) are implied by their subset

We use the concept of Special Ordered Set Variables of Type One (SOS1) to provide equivalent reformulations to those presented the main body of the paper. Let πs, s ∈ S denote a binary variable taking value 1 if the attained probability level is hs
                      and 0 otherwise.
