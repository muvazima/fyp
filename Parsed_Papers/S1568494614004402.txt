               Abstract
               
                  In this paper, we introduce a novel iterative method to finding the fixed point of a nonlinear function. Therefore, we combine ideas proposed in Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (Karaboga and Basturk, 2007) and Bisection method (Burden and Douglas, 1985). This method is new and very efficient for solving a non-linear equation. We illustrate this method with four benchmark functions and compare results with others methods, such as ABC, PSO, GA and Firefly algorithms.
