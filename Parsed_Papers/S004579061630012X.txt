@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Missiles have become important in combat and during the writing of this paper many missile guidance laws were researched. These included proportional navigation (PN) guidance [1], ideal proportional navigation (IPN) guidance [2], and pure proportional navigation (PPN) guidance [3]. With the spread of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, intelligent missile guidance is becoming more widespread. For example, Dalton et al. [4] designed a neural network controller which used the notion of an adaptive critic to solve the pursuit-evasion problem. Lin [5] proposed a fuzzy logic based missile terminal guidance in which the fuzzy rule was based on the line-of-sight (LOS) rate, LOS angular acceleration and relative distance. Li et al. [6] developed a fuzzy logic guidance based on PN guidance, and utilized a genetic algorithm to optimize the fuzzy rule base.

In 2013, particle swarm optimization guidance (PSOG) was proposed by Kung et al. [7], and made its debut in the missile guidance field. The PSOG was based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and optimized the lateral acceleration at each time-step. Afterward, the performance was improved by Chen et al. [8], which is called the improved PSOG (IPSOG). The concept was that the LOS rate is close to zero at each time-step. In other words, the IPSOG was similar to parallel navigation. The IPSOG has the advantages of a robustness and fast reaction; however, the lateral acceleration has severe variations in the initial phase. The attitude of a missile does not only become unstable, but also affects the structure. As for PN guidance, the lateral acceleration had a slight variation in the initial phase. In the terminal phase, it usually varied with a target's maneuvering. Thus, miss distance (MD) might not only be greater, but the final lateral acceleration also might fall in saturation.

In this paper, we propose a dual mode guidance, which is called the PN-IPSOG. The concept is derived from the guidance method of a medium-range missile. In the initial phase, the lateral acceleration is given by the PN guidance. Meanwhile, the switch law (SL) is used to detect the switch timing. When the switch timing arrives, the PN-IPSOG would switch from the PN guidance to the IPSOG. We expect that the PN-IPSOG will not only maintain the advantages of the IPSOG, but will also take the advantages of the PN guidance to replace the disadvantages of the IPSOG.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives mathematical models; Section 3 describes the PN guidance, the IPSOG, and the details of the SL; simulation experiments are shown in Section 4; Finally, Section 5 is the conclusion.

The technique of PN guidance is that the lateral acceleration is proportional to the LOS rate. Until recent years, PN guidance is still in use since it is simple to implement. Generally, the equations [11] of the PN guidance are as follows:

PSO algorithm that was presented by Kennedy et al. [12] in 1995 were widely used to solve the optimization problem. The concept was that the social foraging behavior of a bird swarm is affected by the experience of an individual bird and bird swarm. Here, an individual bird is regarded as an individual particle in the PSO algorithm.

Generally, a particle has two components. One of the two components was a candidate solution which is called the “position”. Another was a mutation value (or evaluation value) which is called the “velocity”. The evaluation function would evaluate the fitness value from the candidate solution. Typical
Eqs. (21) and (22) 
                        [13] of the PSO algorithm then calculates the particle's “velocity” and updates the particle's “position”, respectively.

                         is a particle's velocity; w
                        PSO is an inertial weight which represents a confidence of the current velocity; Both c
                        1 and c
                        2 are two positive constants which represent two confidences of an individual particle's and particle swarm's experience; Both rand

                        2 are two random values between zero and one; Pbest
                        
                           i, j
                         is a best experience of individual particle; Gbesti
                         is a best experience of the particle swarm; X
                        
                           i, j
                         is a particle's position; the subscript i is a generation number; the subscript j is a number of a particle in the particle swarm.

The IPSOG, which is based on a PSO algorithm and the concept of parallel navigation, is one kind of intelligent missile guidance. The implementation steps were as follows:

Step 1. Preset the parameters of the PSO algorithm, including w
                        PSO, c
                        1, c
                        2, V
                        1, j
                        , the maximum generation number i
                        max , the swarm size n, the best fitness value of the individual particle PbestJ
                        1, j
                        , and the best fitness value of the particle swarm GbestJ
                        1.

Step 2. Let X
                        1, j
                         be a set of the lateral accelerations of the y- and z-axis. The X
                        1, j
                         is initialized within a random distribution, and is distributed in four-quadrants. The boundary is limited within the acceleration extremum a
                        max .

Step 3. Let the apc
                         and ayc
                         be equal to the set of X
                        
                           i, j
                        . The apc
                         and ayc
                         then substituted into
Eqs. (1)–(9), and can be solved by the Runge–Kutta method. Thus, X
                        
                           i, j
                         can be converted to the missile's dynamic.

Step 4. A LOS is a virtual straight line between a missile and a target. The LOS rate is the rotation rate of the LOS. In the IPSOG, an objective value is a LOS rate. The Eqs. (23) and (24) [14] are utilized to calculate LOS rates.

The concept is derived from the step-response of automatic control theory. Fig. 3
                        
                        a is a typical step-response of a 2nd order system. The other is the variation of the LOS rate of PN guidance. If we look at Fig. 3b, in the red frame, the variations of the angle μ that is between the tangent of the current LOS rate and the horizontal reference line are greater than the variations of another μ. This can be understood that the guidance law is still adjusting the missile's attitude. As time passes, the variation of μ trends to convergence. This can be understood as the adjustment of the missile's attitude is nearing completion. Soon afterwards, the variation of μ, in the green frame, is approaching a constant. If we look back at Fig. 3.a, a typical step response of a 2nd order system can be divided into two states. One of these is the steady-state where the output of a system arrives and stays in a specified value. The other is the settling-time where the output of a system does not satisfy the definition of a steady-state. In other words, the output of a system is still in adjustment. Through observing Fig. 3, we can understand that (b) is similar to (a). The red frame in Fig. 3.b presents a settling-time, and the green frame presents a steady-state. We utilize this viewpoint, that is, let the variation of the LOS rate be a step-response of a 2nd order system. Therefore, the switch timing is between the settling-time and the steady-state. In other words, it is the timing to switch from the PN guidance to the IPSOG when the adjustment of the missile's attitude nears completion. According to above, the PN-IPSOG utilizes the Eqs. (28)–(31), which is called the SL, to detect the switch timing, and switches from the PN guidance to the IPSOG.

                        IPSOG are the lateral accelerations from the IPSOG; Both H and subscript H are a number of iterations; the subscript q determines the amount of μ in a mean function.

When the missile pursues a maneuvering target, the lateral accelerations are first given by the PN guidance. Meanwhile, Eq. (28) calculates μ at each time-step, and Eq. (29) detects the switch timing. When the switch timing arrives, ςstart equals H. In order to switch stably, Eq. (30) would be used to calculate the lateral accelerations. Next, the lateral accelerations are given by Eq. (31) when wReplace
                         is greater than one.

Although the lateral accelerations of y- and z-axis use the same SL, detecting and switching process are carried out independently.

The three kinds of common evasion strategies are taken to verify the guidance performance of the PN-IPSOG. Evasion strategy 1 is a maximum g-force left turn flight, and the control variables are set as 0, 9, and π/2, respectively. Evasion strategy 2 is a maximum g-force S-curve maneuvering. The control variables are set as 0, 9, and π/2 in the first 5 seconds, and are set as 0, 9, and

                     , and the variations of the lateral acceleration were illustrated in Fig. 8
                     . The simulation results were summarized in Table 2

Although the time-to-go (T
                     go) of the PN-IPSOG was the same as the PN guidance, the results indicated significant guidance performances, which the PN-IPSOG was better than the PN guidance, for the lateral acceleration at the final stage and the number of saturation. No significant guidance performances were found at MD and mean lateral acceleration; however, the PN-IPSOG was smaller than the PN guidance. On the other hand, the smaller MD in the PN-IPSOG showed that the PN-IPSOG had better accuracy than the PN guidance. The smaller lateral acceleration in the PN-IPSOG revealed that the PN-IPSOG reserved more kinetic energy than the PN guidance. Especially, compared the PN-IPSOG with the PN guidance, the lateral acceleration appeared to be very close to zero at the final stage. These might imply that the PN-IPSOG had the ability to pursue a high maneuvering target.

The more detailed understanding of the variation of the lateral acceleration can be gained from Fig. 8. Two points are worth making about Fig. 8. In the initial and medium phases, which are during the first 9 seconds, the variation of the PN-IPSOG's lateral acceleration was similar to the PN guidance. The results were what were expected. In other words, the severe variation of the lateral acceleration of the IPSOG was improved by the PN guidance. After 9 seconds, which is the second point, the lateral acceleration of the PN guidance trended to saturation; however, the PN-IPSOG still kept a slight variation and trended to zero. These revealed that the PN-IPSOG had stable lateral acceleration, that is, the PN-IPSOG was not affected by the target's maneuvering. The saturation numbers were also consistent with this viewpoint in Tables 2–4. In addition, these might imply that the PN-IPSOG had better accuracy than the PN guidance. Furthermore, the PN-IPSOG was more stable than the PN guidance at the final stage.

As a brief summary, the simulation results revealed that the PN-IPSOG had a better performance than the PN guidance at MD, and lateral acceleration.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper has presented a dual mode guidance which is based on the PN guidance and the IPSOG to optimize guidance performance for a missile, and is called the PN-IPSOG; in which, the SL is designed to detect the switch timing and switches from the PN guidance to the IPSOG. Through simulation results, some important findings were that the PN-IPSOG had good performances at MD and lateral acceleration, and three of these findings were worth summarizing: 1. the mean lateral acceleration was small; 2. the final lateral acceleration was close to zero; 3. the saturation numbers were smaller. We speculated that the above are results are due to the following. First, the lateral acceleration of the PN guidance has a slight variation. It has replaced the severe variation of the IPSOG. When switching from the PN guidance to the IPSOG, the SL progressively increases the influence of the IPSOG's lateral acceleration and decreases the influence of the lateral acceleration of the PN guidance's progressively, that is, the severe variation of the lateral acceleration can be inhibited from the SL. Finally, the IPSOG which is based on the PSO algorithm with the concept of parallel navigation optimizes the lateral acceleration at each time-step. Thus, the results that the lateral acceleration approaches zero at the final stage were presented above. Comparing the PN-IPSOG with the PN guidance, the PN-IPSOG had better performances, i.e., MD and lateral accelerations were smaller. These are the important contributions of this paper.

In future, the PN-IPSOG may apply and extend to other subjects, such as medium-range and long-range missile guidance or pursuing a high maneuvering target and further verify the effectiveness of the PN-IPSOG.
