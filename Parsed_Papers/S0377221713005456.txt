                  We develop a delay time model (DTM) to determine the optimal maintenance policy under a novel assumption: postponed replacement. Delay time is defined as the time lapse from the occurrence of a defect up until failure. Inspections can be performed to monitor the system state at non-negligible cost. Most works in the literature assume that instantaneous replacement is enforced as soon as a defect is detected at an inspection. In contrast, we relax this assumption and allow replacement to be postponed for an additional time period. The key motivation is to achieve better utilization of the system’s useful life, and reduce replacement costs by providing a sufficient time window to prepare maintenance resources. We model the preventive replacement cost as a non-increasing function of the postponement interval. We then derive the optimal policy under the modified assumption for a system with exponentially distributed defect arrival time, both for a deterministic delay time and for a more general random delay time. For the settings with a deterministic delay time, we also establish an upper bound on the cost savings that can be attained. A numerical case study is presented to benchmark the benefits of our modified assumption against conventional instantaneous replacement discussed in the literature.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Most engineering systems suffer from unexpected failures due to degradation, operational and environmental conditions such as random shocks, or operator abuse. Maintenance activities consist of corrective and preventive measures taken in order to minimize the serious consequences of unexpected failures. Planning maintenance activities can be a very challenging task due to a plethora of factors, including the randomness of failure processes, scarcity of maintenance resources, and complexity of engineering systems. The cost of maintenance activities represents one of the key drivers of an organization’s total costs. Maintenance costs typically account for 15–60% of the total value of the end product (Mobley, 2002). The current work belongs to the body of literature on maintenance optimization models, an area that focuses on developing mathematical and analytical models to determine optimal maintenance policies. There are numerous research efforts within this area that address important maintenance decisions such as replacement, inspection, repair, and maintenance scheduling. In this paper, we focus on optimizing inspection and replacement decisions. In particular, we develop a mathematical model to determine the optimal inspection and replacement policy for a system under delay time.

Delay time is a concept that was first introduced by Christer (1982). It is defined as the time lapse from the occurrence of a defect in the system up until failure. In other words, after a defect occurs, the system can stay operational for an additional time interval, denoted as the delay time. In this paper, we assume failures are self-announcing while defects are not. Failure requires an immediate corrective replacement at cost c
                     
                        f
                     . The system can be inspected at any time at cost c
                     
                        s
                     . Upon inspection, the system is identified as being either in a “normal” or “defective” operating state. If the system state is identified as normal, no action is required. On the other hand, if inspection identifies the system as being in a defective state, a preventive replacement of the system is triggered at cost c
                     
                        p
                     
                     <
                     c
                     
                        f
                     
                     −
                     c
                     
                        s
                     . Within these settings, the delay time can be regarded as a window of opportunity for performing preventive replacement before failure occurs. The decision under consideration is to determine optimal inspection intervals such that the long-run average cost of the system is minimized.

The main contribution of this paper is developing a delay time model (DTM) to determine the optimal policy for a single-component system under a novel assumption: postponed replacement. The majority of the works in the literature on DTM make the common assumption that the system is replaced instantaneously upon the identification of a defect at an inspection (Christer & Lee, 2000; MacPherson & Glazebrook, 2011; Wang, 2009). In contrast, we allow replacement to be postponed for an additional time interval. The benefit of this is twofold: first, better utilization of the system’s useful life is achieved, since it can still be operated for an additional period of time before replacement. Second, it provides an opportunity to efficiently schedule and plan scarce maintenance resources, such as material and labor. The latter aspect is captured by modeling the preventive replacement cost as a non-increasing function of the postponement interval. An interesting trade-off arises between these benefits and the drawback that postponement increases the probability of a defect accumulating into a failure.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we survey the relevant literature on DTM. In Section 3, we review a base-case model with a deterministic delay time under the assumption that replacement is performed instantaneously after detecting a defect. The optimal policy under this setting is presented. Next, we introduce the postponed replacement assumption to this model and derive the optimal policy in Section 4. A numerical case study is presented in Section 5 to validate the model and highlight the benefits of the modified assumption. The analytical and numerical results are generalized in Section 6 to settings with a random delay time. Finally, Section 7 presents concluding remarks and highlights directions for future research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Maintenance optimization models have been extensively studied in the literature. Generally, most research efforts focus on developing mathematical models to determine optimal inspection (Chen, Chen, & Yuan, 2003; Chiang & Yuan, 2001; Yeh, 1997), replacement (Benyamini & Yechiali, 1999; Elwany & Gebraeel, 2008; Karamatsoukis & Kyriakidis, 2010), and repair policies (Douer & Yechiali, 1994; Huynh, Castro, Barros, & Bérenguer, 2012; Kurt & Kharoufeh, 2010) for complex engineering systems. Dekker (1996) surveys maintenance optimization models, with a focus on their applications in real-world case studies. An overview of software tools and inherent challenges is also presented. In Scarf (1997), the author discusses the importance of bridging the gap between theory and practice in developing mathematical models for maintenance optimization, and highlights key areas in maintenance modeling. A more recent survey is provided by van Horenbeek, Pintelon, and Muchiri (2010).

Delay time models (referred to as DTM henceforth) have received notable attention within models for optimizing inspection. Christer (1982) introduces the delay time concept as a two-stage failure process, defines basic terminology, and presents an application on the maintenance of buildings. Several research efforts subsequently extended upon this work and presented theoretical results and case studies across a wide range of application domains. Examples include inspection of intercity buses in Malaysia (Desa & Christer, 2001), fishing vessels (Pillay, Wang, & Wall, 2001), and production equipment for the carbon black industry (Jones, Jenkinson, & Wang, 2009). In Wang (2011), the author extends the two-stage failure process introduced by Christer (1982) to a three-stage failure process where the traditionally defined delay time is divided into another two stages corresponding to “minor” and “severe” defective stages.

The literature on DTM is rich, including works that use various objective functions, solution methods, and modeling assumptions. The most common objective functions focus on minimizing long-run average cost (MacPherson & Glazebrook, 2011; Scarf, Cavalcante, Dwight, & Gordon, 2009), total expected discounted costs over an infinite horizon (Aven & Castro, 2009), or total expected costs over a finite horizon (Wang & Christer, 1997). Other objective functions that are used in some works include the maximization of mission reliability (Attia, 1997; Cerone, 1993; Christer, 1987; Zhao, Chan, Roberts, & Madelin, 2007) and the minimization of system downtime (Christer & Lee, 2000). In most cases, researchers have used numerical methods to solve the models due to their complexity. Some few exceptions exist, such as works that analyze single-component systems with exponentially distributed time to the occurrence of a defect. Coolen and Dekker (1995), Maillart and Pollock (2002, sec III), and Mine and Kawai (1974, model II) study these systems and provide analytical results regarding the structure of the optimal inspection policy. Excellent surveys of research efforts on DTM are provided in (Christer, 1999; Wang, 2008), and the most recent review is found in (Wang, 2012).

While a variety of different approaches is cited in the literature on DTM, we notice that the majority of these approaches share one common assumption: instantaneous replacement of the system upon the identification of a defect. We propose to relax this assumption and allow for postponing replacement for an additional time period; and we explicitly model the preventive replacement cost as a non-increasing function of this postponement interval. Zhao, Miao, and Zhang (2009) consider a similar approach for a non-homogeneous Poisson defect arrival process. However, they only consider to postpone preventive minimal repair, while the system is replaced at predetermined time epochs. In contrast, we determine the optimal time to replace the system. In particular, we develop a delay time model for a single-component system with exponentially distributed defect arrival time. We derive the optimal inspection policy, and the optimal replacement policy that will be followed upon the identification of a defect. Our objective is to minimize the long-run average cost of the system. We demonstrate through a numerical study how the modified assumption can result in reduced costs due to better utilization of the system’s lifetime and increased flexibility in planning scarce maintenance resources.

Consider a single-component system and let S
                     ={Normal,
                     Defective,
                     Failed} denote the possible states that the system can take on. In the normal operating state, the system performs its desired function and needs no intervention. In the defective state, the system is still functioning but a defect exists, indicating that the system is prone to failure. Preventive replacement is needed if an inspection reveals that the system is in the defective state. Finally, the failed state is one where the system can no longer perform its desired function. System failure is assumed to be self-announcing, and requires an instantaneous corrective replacement to restore the system to its normal operating condition. The defect arrival time is assumed to be exponentially distributed. This is a common assumption suitable for modeling systems subject to random shocks. Finally, the delay time is assumed to be deterministic. This setting is observed in Maillart and Pollock (2002), where the authors analyze the inspection policy at a major automotive manufacturer in the US. The following summarizes the basic notation and assumptions:
                        
                           1.
                           The random variable U denotes the defect arrival time, and follows an exponential distribution with mean 1/λ.

The delay time is deterministic and denoted by τ.

Inspection can be performed any time at cost c
                              
                                 s
                              
                              >0. Inspections are assumed to be perfect, and fully reveal the state of the system.

If a defect is identified upon inspection, the system is immediately replaced at cost c
                              
                                 p
                              
                              >0. Replacement time is assumed to be negligible.

Failure of the system is self-announcing, and requires instantaneous replacement at cost c
                              
                                 f
                              
                              >
                              c
                              
                                 p
                              
                              +
                              c
                              
                                 s
                              .

Notice that if an inspection reveals that the system is in the normal operating state, this represents a renewal epoch due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution. Therefore, both failures and inspections, regardless of the inspection outcome, represent renewal epochs. Accordingly, an inspection policy can be fully characterized by one variable t, representing the time from the last renewal until the next inspection. For illustration, Fig. 1
                      displays a sample path of such a system being inspected t time units after each renewal. The white dots represent defect arrival and the solid dots represent failure. It can be seen that the first inspection reveals a defect upon which a preventive replacement is performed to avoid failure.

The long-run average cost, Q(t), for this model can be evaluated using the renewal-reward theorem as:

                           The optimal inspection interval with exponentially distributed defect arrival time and deterministic delay time τ is given by:

                     Theorem 1 states that the optimal policy is either: (1) never inspect the system and only apply corrective replacement upon failure, or (2) set the inspection interval equal to the delay time τ, being the largest value ensuring that failure will never occur. The optimal decision can be determined by evaluating and comparing the long-run average cost associated with both policies. In the next section, we will investigate the optimal policy under postponed replacement. We will then use the result in Theorem 1 to benchmark our proposed policy in Section 5.

As mentioned earlier, all the works in the literature enforce Assumption 4: when a defect is detected at an inspection, preventive replacement is performed instantaneously. The reasoning behind this is to eliminate the risk of an expensive system failure at cost c
                     
                        f
                      as soon as the defect is detected. Moreover, this assumption is mathematically convenient and facilitates the analysis. A drawback, however, is that it compromises the opportunity of having an additional time interval remaining before failure, depending on the time at which the defect originated. The benefit of postponing a replacement upon detecting a defect is twofold. First, it offers better utilization of the system’s useful life. Second, provided that failure does not occur during the postponement duration, more time is allowed to adequately prepare maintenance resources for preventive replacement, resulting in reduced costs. Postponing a replacement is particularly justified in cases where detecting a defect does not necessarily imply a large failure probability within the next small time interval. The setting with deterministic delay time τ represents an example of these cases. Suppose that an inspection detects a defect, given that the previous inspection t time units ago identified the system to be in the normal operating state. Then, the probability of failure in the next (τ
                     −
                     t)+ time units is equal to 0, where (x)+
                     = max{x,0}. Hence, for t
                     <
                     τ, postponing replacement for an additional τ
                     −
                     t time units can only be beneficial.

We are interested in investigating the optimal policy under postponed replacement. A policy has to address the additional decisions whether or not to postpone replacement upon detecting a defect, and how long to postpone it. Hence, a policy can be represented by a pair (t,
                     z): an inspection is planned t time units after the last renewal, and if a defect is detected, preventive replacement is planned z time units later. To model the cost of a preventive replacement, we define a right-continuous, non-increasing function c
                     
                        r
                     : [0,∞)→(0,∞), with c
                     
                        r
                     (0)≡
                     c
                     
                        p
                     . Here, c
                     
                        r
                     (z) denotes the cost of preventive replacement if it is performed z time units after the detection of a defect. Moreover, we now change Assumption 5 into c
                     
                        f
                     
                     >
                     c
                     
                        r
                     (τ)+
                     c
                     
                        s
                     . This assumption is logical, because if c
                     
                        f
                     
                     ⩽
                     c
                     
                        r
                     (τ)+
                     c
                     
                        s
                      the problem is trivial since inspections are never economical. In Fig. 2
                     , a sample path is given for a (t,
                     z) policy. Note that setting z
                     =0 gives the set of all policies under Assumption 4.

We now determine the optimal policy (t
                     ∗,
                     z
                     ∗) that minimizes the long-run average cost Q(t,
                     z) for all policies (t,
                     z). The domain of Q(t,
                     z) can be subdivided into the following sets I
                     ={(t,
                     z): 0<
                     t
                     ⩽
                     τ,0⩽
                     z

We start by emphasizing that the argmin operator is defined by Lemma 1. Next, we will construct the proof by showing that no other policy is better than (t
                           ∗,
                           z
                           ∗) over all sets on which Q(t,
                           z) is defined. To do this, let (t,
                           z) be a policy with t
                           >0, z
                           ⩾0, and distinguish the following three cases:
                              
                                 
                                    (t,

                                    For this case we obtain:

                                    z) becomes evident by considering an alternative selection of renewal epochs under policy (∞,
                                    z). Let the system regenerate if no defect has arrived t time units after the last renewal, or, if a defect arrives within t time units after the last renewal, at failure. Under this alternative definition, the expected length of a renewal cycle equals E[L(t,
                                    z)]. Also, the cycle cost is c
                                    
                                       f
                                     if a defect arrives within t time units after the last renewal, which occurs with probability (1−
                                    e
                                    −λt
                                    ), and 0 otherwise.

We have now established that no other policy (t,
                           z) is better than (t
                           ∗,
                           z
                           ∗). Therefore, (t
                           ∗,
                           z
                           ∗) is the optimal policy. □

To find the optimal policy given by Theorem 2, we first need to determine t′ numerically and then compute Q(t′,
                     τ
                     −
                     t′) and Q(∞,
                     z). The theorem states that the optimal policy is either to: (1) never inspect the system and only perform corrective replacement upon failure if Q(∞,
                     z)⩽
                     Q(t′,
                     τ
                     −
                     t′); or, otherwise, (2) inspect t′ time units after each renewal, 0<
                     t′⩽

                     t′ represents the maximum amount of time with which postponing replacement still ensures that failure will not occur. This result shares a common characteristic with Theorem 1: corrective replacement and preventive replacement are mutually exclusive actions within the optimal policy.

We are now interested in assessing the benefits and cost savings when we allow postponed replacement. We do this by computing the percentage saving:

                                    Eq. (13) has the following interpretation. If the inspection cost is dropped, it is optimal to monitor the system continuously by bringing the inspection interval down to 0. Since the delay time is deterministic, the exact failure time can be predicted with certainty. When postponing replacements is allowed, the optimal policy is thus to monitor the system continuously and perform preventive replacement right before failure, resulting in long-run average cost

                                    (τ). In the last line, the first term in the minimum operator can be regarded as a function of λτ. Hence, we can derive an upper bound on S by maximizing the first term in λτ. There is no closed form expression for this maximum, so we used numerical methods to evaluate it as

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of postponing replacement, determined the optimal policy, and derived an upper bound on the percentage saving, S, for a system with exponentially distributed defect arrival time and deterministic delay time. In this section, we highlight the benefit of allowing postponed replacement by conducting a numerical experiment to evaluate the cost savings for a number of test instances. For each instance, we benchmark the costs associated with our proposed policy against the costs associated with the optimal policy when instantaneous replacement is assumed, as given by Theorem 1. We consider two different forms of the replacement cost function c

                      on S for both functions. For example, the cost of shipping a spare part or service tool through a non-expedited mode of transportation is often equal to a fraction of the cost incurred for an expedited order. Note that in this context, usually the notion of sufficient time cannot be directly related to failure process parameters as λ or τ. We let a
                     ∈{0.2,0.1,0.05}. The two forms of c
                     
                        r
                      are suitable for modeling different applications. The step function is appropriate when exactly two options for the preventive replacement procedure are available, with one option at a significantly lower cost than the other. The cheaper option will typically have longer lead time. Under the expedited option, higher costs can be attributed to either of the following: (1) spare parts and service tools need to be kept on stock in close proximity to the system or (2) fast and expensive transport options have to be used. In contrast, under the cheaper option: (1) parts and tools are stocked in centralized points (leading to much lower stocks) or (2) slower and cheaper transport options can be used. The convex non-increasing function is suitable for modeling cases where multiple settings exist for performing replacement, and the costs associated with each setting decrease as a function of the delivery lead time to provide the required maintenance resources.

                      are varied. Four additional instances represent extreme cases of parameter values to test the robustness of the model and draw some additional insight.

We start by analyzing the outcomes of instances 1–18. The results show that significant cost savings can be realized for both forms of the cost function c
                     
                        r
                     , with average savings of 26.5% and 30.1% for the convex and step cost functions, respectively, if a
                     =0.05. Clearly, the highest cost savings are obtained for the smallest value of a because it results in lower preventive replacement cost for any postponement duration. Note, however, that a
                     =0.2 still yields average savings of 21.1% and 23.5% for the convex and step cost functions, respectively.

Next, observe that if

                                 )
                              
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       c
                                    
                                    
                                       s
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                      gives larger savings. Savings are obtained if the optimal inspection interval under postponement is smaller than τ, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 t
                              
                              
                                 a
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                           <
                           τ
                        
                     . The aim of any t
                     <
                     τ is to achieve a preventive replacement cost decrease, c
                     
                        r
                     (0)−
                     c
                     
                        r
                     (τ
                     −
                     t), which is proportional to c
                     
                        r
                     (0), and to increase the system’s lifetime such that replacements are performed less frequently. The drawback is the increased frequency of inspections at cost c
                     
                        s
                     . Hence, for any t
                     <
                     τ larger savings are obtained when c
                     
                        r
                     (0) is larger relative to c
                     
                        s
                     .

We also note for instances 1–18 that the cost savings increase in τ. This is mainly because larger values of the delay time τ provide a larger window for postponing replacement and reducing replacement cost c
                     
                        r
                     (z). A larger τ also leads to a higher increase in the inspection frequency when the inspection interval is lowered from τ to a small value in order to identify defects at an early stage. However, for instances 1–18 this is outweighed by the additional possibilities to reduce replacements costs.

It is also especially illustrative to observe that for the step function 0.00% savings are obtained in instances 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 with τ
                     =0.05. An explanation is provided by the observation that for the step function all postponement durations z
                     ∈[0,0.05)give c
                     
                        r
                     (z)=
                     c
                     
                        r
                     (0). In other words, the benefit of postponing replacements in planning maintenance resources at lower costs vanishes if τ
                     =0.05. Finally, we note that in the majority of instances, increasing c
                     
                        f
                      does not have any effect on cost savings, because the optimal policy already ensures that no failures can occur. This explains why instances 3–9 yield the same results as instances 12–18 for both cost functions.

Instances 19–22 yield some interesting observations consistent with the extreme values used for the model parameters. For example, in instance 22 the optimal policy given by Theorem 1 is a corrective maintenance policy (∞,
                     z), whereas Theorem 2 switches to a policy in which all failures are avoided, resulting in significantly high cost savings. A purpose for instances 19–21 is to test how close the cost savings can approach the upper bound on S when inspection costs are non-negligible. Those upper bounds on the cost savings are given by Lemma 2 as 84.6%, 92.3%, and 96.15% for a
                     =0.2,0.1,0.05, respectively. Indeed, the cost savings for instances 19–21 are close to these theoretical upper bounds.

An important assumption in the previous sections is that the delay time is deterministic. Under this assumption, we drew a clear comparison between the optimal policy with postponement and the optimal policy without postponement. In this section, we investigate the benefits of postponed replacement under the more general case of a random delay time. In particular, we concentrate on the case in which the delay time follows a discrete probability distribution. Notice that any continuous delay time distribution can be approximated arbitrarily close by a discrete delay time distribution. In contrast to the previous sections, we denote the delay time in this section by a random variable H with support {τ

                     τ
                     2,…,
                     τ
                     
                        N
                     }, where 0⩽
                     τ

                     <∞. We also introduce the function q:{1,…,
                     N}→[0,1], defined by q(j)=
                     P(H
                     =
                     τ
                     
                        j
                     ) for all j
                     ∈{1,…,
                     N}. Finally, we modify Assumption 5 into c
                     
                        f
                     
                     >
                     c
                     
                        r
                     (τ
                     
                        N
                     )+
                     c
                     
                        s
                      to exclude trivial problem instances.

Similar to the previous sections, we derive analytical results on the optimal policy, both for instantaneous and postponed preventive replacement. Note that under a random delay time, both the time epochs at which an inspection identifies the system as normal and the time epochs at which corrective or preventive replacement is performed still represent renewal epochs since the time to defect arrival follows an exponential distribution. Therefore, the optimal policies for instantaneous and postponed preventive replacement can still be fully characterized by a single variable t and a pair (t,
                     z) respectively. We redefine Q(t) and Q(t,
                     z) as the long-run average cost of policy t and the long-run average cost of policy (t,
                     z) under random delay time H. These can be expressed as follows:

The proofs of Theorems 3 and 4 are deferred to the appendices. Theorems 1 and 2 represent special cases of the theorems above, that are obtained by taking a random delay time with support {τ}. It can be noted, however, that the general analytical result is less informative if the delay time is not deterministic, since each τ
                     
                        j
                      needs to be considered to determine the optimal inspection interval in Theorem 3 and each set Π
                     
                        j
                      needs to be considered to determine (t′,
                     z′) in Theorem 4.

We conduct a similar numerical experiment as in Section 5 to evaluate the impact of the randomness in the delay time on the cost savings that result when postponement is allowed. In constructing the numerical instances, we take the same values for the parameters and preventive replacement cost functions c
                     
                        r
                      as in Section 5, but with random delay time H that follows a discrete uniform distribution with a support given by either {0.09,0.10,0.11} or {0.05,0.10,0.15}. The coefficient of variation of these distributions, an indicator for the randomness of the delay time, is given by 0.08 and 0.41 respectively. The results for the 12 problem instances constructed by this procedure are reported in Tables 3 and 4
                     
                     . As opposed to the tables in the previous section, we also report the postponement interval for the optimal policies with postponement since it cannot be directly deducted from the inspection interval anymore. Furthermore, we report for each problem instance the coefficient of variation, c
                     
                        v
                     , of the random delay time.

First, we investigate the impact of the randomness in the delay time on the cost savings. For this purpose, we compare the instances in Tables 1 and 2 that have deterministic delay time 0.10, i.e., with c
                     
                        v
                     
                     =0, with the problem instances with c
                     
                        v
                     
                     =0.08 and c
                     
                        v
                     
                     =0.41. It can be observed that the optimal long-run average cost increases in the coefficient of variation, both with and without postponement. This can be attributed to the fact that the randomness in the delay time makes it difficult to both mitigate the increased risk of failure for small delay times and take advantage of longer system lifetimes for large delay times. We further observe that the benefit of postponed replacement decreases in the coefficient of variation. The average cost savings for the convex cost function with a
                     =0.05 are 26.5%, 22.5%, and 7.5 % for c
                     
                        v
                     
                     =0, 0.08, 0.41 respectively. The average cost savings for the step cost function with a
                     =0.05 are 31.8%, 21.8%, and 3.7% for c
                     
                        v
                     
                     =0, 0.08, 0.41 respectively. An explanation is that less postponement intervals can ensure that failures will not occur if smaller delay times are possible. This restricts the potential to achieve cost savings by postponing replacements. Still, for a small coefficient of variation, c
                     
                        v
                     
                     = 0.08, the cost savings are significant. Moreover, also for the higher coefficient of variation, c
                     
                        v
                     
                     =0.41, problem instances that allow for significant savings exceeding 18% can be identified.

The influence of the other problem parameters on the cost savings is similar to their influence in the settings with a deterministic delay time discussed in Section 5. For example, larger savings are obtained for lower values of a and higher values of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       c
                                    
                                    
                                       r
                                    
                                 
                                 (
                                 0
                                 )
                              
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       c
                                    
                                    
                                       s
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     . In accordance to the results for a deterministic delay time, in many instances no savings can be obtained for the step function. For an explanation, note that for the step function the benefit of a lower preventive replacement cost can only be achieved by a postponement duration z
                     ⩾0.075. However, selecting a policy with such a postponement duration has the drawback that a significantly high inspection frequency has to be applied in order to ensure that failures will not occur, if possible at all. This drawback is reflected in the inspection cost rate. In comparison to the deterministic delay time, the parameter c
                     
                        f
                      affects the percentage savings of postponed replacement more often, because in more problem instances failures can occur under the optimal policy.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we developed a delay time model for a single-component system under a novel assumption: we allow preventive replacement to be postponed upon identifying a defect at an inspection. This is in contrast to all previous works in the literature that assume instantaneous replacement after a defect is identified. The benefit of postponing a replacement is twofold. First, the useful life of the system is better utilized. Second, it provides an opportunity to adequately plan maintenance resources, which results in reduced replacement costs. We considered a single-component system with exponentially distributed defect arrival time. For these systems, the optimal policy when replacement is instantaneous has been studied in the literature for settings with a deterministic delay time. We determined the optimal policy under the modified postponed replacement assumption for these settings, and established an upper bound on the cost savings that can be attained. To benchmark our model, we conducted numerical experiments to evaluate the percentage savings under our modified assumptions. We considered several instances of the model parameters and two forms for the replacement cost function: a convex function and a step function. Results demonstrated that significant cost savings can be attained when postponing replacements is allowed.

Next, we extended the analysis to a more general setting with random delay times. We analyzed the optimal policy under instantaneous replacement and under postponed replacement, and conducted a numerical experiment to investigate the impact of the randomness in the delay time on the cost savings. These cost savings were observed to decrease in the coefficient of variation of the delay time distribution. Nonetheless, it was shown that the benefits of postponed replacement continue to exist for a more general model with random delay times. In particular, the cost savings were still significant for smaller coefficients of variation.

Although these results are specifically valid for systems with exponentially distributed defect arrival time, the insight regarding the benefits of postponed replacement can be extended to other defect arrival times. Directions for future research include considering other distributions of the defect arrival time, as well as extending the analysis to multi-component systems.

                     z), and condition on the event that U
                     ⩾
                     ∊, so that the expected cycle cost and length are given by c
                     2 and l
                     2. Then, ∊ time units elapse since the start of the renewal cycle without any defect arrival, and a situation arises as if policy (t
                     −
                     ∊,
                     z) is followed: the system is in normal operating state and an inspection is planned t
                     −
                     ∊ time units ahead. The only difference is that the cycle is already ∊ time units old. Hence, c
                     2
                     =
                     E[C(t

Let us now assume that (t,

                     . The second inequality follows from Eq. (A.5) and the assumption that policy (t,
                     z) is optimal. However, as we now obtain that Q(t
                     +
                     ∊,
                     z)<
                     Q(t,
                     z) we arrive at a contradiction. We can conclude that policy (t,
                     z) cannot be optimal.

We have now established that no other policy (t,
                     z) is better than (t
                     ∗,
                     z
                     ∗). Therefore, (t
                     ∗,
                     z
                     ∗) is the optimal policy.

We will construct the proof by showing that no other policy is better than

Identical arguments as used in the case (t,0)∈
                     IV(j) in the proof of Theorem 4 can be applied to show that policy t cannot be optimal.

We have now established that no other policy t is better than

                      over all sets on which Q(t) is defined. Therefore,
