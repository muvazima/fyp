                  Various geometric operators have been playing an important role in surface processing. For example, many shape analysis algorithms have been developed based on eigenfunctions of the ​Laplace–Beltrami operator (LBO), which is defined based on the first fundamental form of the surface. In this paper, we introduce two new geometric operators based on the second fundamental form of the surface, namely the secondary Laplace operator (SLO) and generalized Giaquinta–Hildebrandt operator (GGHO). Surface features such as concave creases/regions and convex ridges can be captured by eigenfunctions of the SLO, which can be used in surface segmentation with concave and convex features detected. Moreover, a new geometric flow method is developed based on the GGHO, providing an effective tool for sharp feature-preserving surface smoothing.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Geometric operators are the basis for many algorithms in surface processing. Based on the first fundamental form of the surface, the Laplace–Beltrami operator (LBO) is defined and its eigenfunctions are well-known for their property of capturing shape behavior and structural feature of an object  [1–4]. They vary along the object surface and are invariant to different poses, which makes them ideal for applications in pose-invariant Reeb graph construction  [4], shape matching  [1] or registration  [5], the Shape-DNA  [3], and surface quadrangulation or parameterization  [6–10]. Another important application of the LBO eigenfunctions is surface segmentation. The distribution of eigenfunctions is used together with isocontours  [2,11,12] and point clustering  [13–15] to segment surface into several components. In practice, different methods were employed to improve the performance of LBO eigenfunctions [16,17]. To detect concavities, eigenfunctions from a concavity-aware Laplacian  [11] were used to generate a single segmentation field.

Besides computing eigenfunctions, geometric operators are also used in various geometric flows for surface fairing and smoothing  [18–23]. The mean curvature and Gaussian curvatures are usually used to design geometric operators  [22,24]. Generally, geometric flows smooth surfaces and remove noise by moving nodes in the normal direction, while the tangential movement regularizes the elements. The tangential movement can also help strengthen surface features, which was seldom considered in the existing methods.

In this paper, we introduce two new operators, namely the secondary Laplace operator (SLO) and generalized Giaquinta–Hildebrandt operator (GGHO), based on the second fundamental form of the surface. Different from the LBO eigenfunctions, the SLO eigenfunctions can capture concave and convex surface features which can be used to segment concave and convex regions. The main contribution of this paper includes
                        
                           1.
                           Two new geometric operators (SLO and GGHO) are introduced based on the second fundamental form of the surface;

Surface segmentation methods are developed based on the SLO eigenfunctions with concave creases/regions and convex ridges detected; and

A new geometric flow method is developed based on the GGHO for surface smoothing, which preserves and strengthens sharp features on the surface.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section  2 reviews the definition of several existing geometric operators and eigenfunction computation. Section  3 introduces the SLO and its application on surface segmentation. Section  4 talks about the GGHO and a new geometric flow method. Section  5 shows the results. Finally, Section  6 draws conclusions and points out the future work.

Before introducing our new operators, we first briefly review definitions of several existing geometric operators. More detailed descriptions can be found in  [25]. Eigenfunctions of different operators can be computed using isogeometric analysis (IGA) based on Catmull–Clark basis functions  [26].

                           W
                         on the surface, we obtain an eigenfunction of the specific geometric operator.

In this paper, we focus on the two new operators based on the second fundamental form of the surface, and a cubic or higher order surface representation is required. While many other methods can also be used, we choose the cubic Catmull–Clark subdivision surface due to its wide adoption  [26]. As shown in Fig. 1
                        , for the input triangular surfaces we use cross field-based surface parameterization  [27,7] to generate semi-structured quadrilateral meshes with only a few extraordinary nodes. Triangle subdivision schemes such as the Loop subdivision can also be used to study SLO and GGHO, but attentions should be paid to the number and placement of extraordinary nodes. Fig. 2
                        (a)–(b) shows the first four eigenfunctions of the LBO and GHO for the Elk model, respectively. The LBO eigenfunctions vary smoothly on the surface following the main structure of the model, but it is hard to detect curvature-related features (e.g., the concave creases connecting the four wheels, the horn and the main Elk body) because the LBO is defined based on the first fundamental form of the surface, see Fig. 2(c) for the segmentation result using the LBO eigenfunctions. On the contrary, the GHO eigenfunctions hardly reveal any geometric feature of the object. This is because 
                           ◊
                           f
                         is almost zero in the planar regions, which makes the matrix 
                           
                              
                                 M
                              
                              
                                 G
                              
                           
                         close to singular. To better detect curvature-related features, we define two new geometric operators (SLO and GGHO) in the following two sections.

Based on the second fundamental form of the surface, we generalize the definition of the STO, and introduce a new geometric operator named the SLO. Different from the LBO eigenfunctions, the SLO eigenfunctions are sensitive to concave creases/regions and convex ridges, providing a powerful basis for surface segmentation.

We generalize Eq. (3) by replacing 
                           K
                         with

As defined using the second fundamental form of the surface, the SLO eigenfunctions are sensitive to curvature changes on the surface. By choosing different values for 
                           Ψ
                        , different surface features such as concave creases/regions and convex ridges can be detected using the SLO eigenfunctions. In the following, we introduce three different choices of 
                           Ψ
                         for surface segmentation.

Due to the second fundamental form in the definition of SLO, its eigenfunctions reflect the curvature-related surface features, which provide a convenient basis for surface segmentation. Basically, surface segmentation consists of two main steps: computing eigenfunctions and mapping vertices onto a 
                           k
                        -dimensional space using the first 
                           k
                         modes; and clustering vertices into a series of groups or surface patches. In this paper, point clustering is fulfilled using Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM)  [28]. The clustering result can be evaluated using the Davies–Bouldin value  [29], which determines the optimal group number.

With different choices of 
                           Ψ
                        , the SLO eigenfunctions tend to emphasize different types of surface features such as concave creases/regions and convex ridges. In this section, we use the mean curvature 
                           H
                         and Gaussian curvature 
                           K
                         to define 
                           Ψ
                        . To avoid generating singular matrices, we restrict

                                  is a constant, the eigenfunction value varies intensively across both concave creases and convex ridges and stays similar in smooth regions surrounded by them, so each smooth region can be segmented as a patch. Since the choice of the constant value does not change the distribution of eigenfunctions, we simply choose 
                                    Ψ
                                    =

                                    Ψ
                                    =
                                    
                                       
                                          e

                                  for segmenting components with concave creases only. In many objects, components with physical meanings are usually connected with concave creases rather than convex ridges. For example in Fig. 4
                                 , the connection regions between the horn, four wheels and the body of the Elk model are all concave creases. These concave creases have negative 
                                    K
                                  while convex ridges have positive 
                                    K
                                 . In addition, the SLO eigenfunctions tend to be more sensitive to regions with a smaller 
                                    Ψ
                                 , where the eigenfunction value varies intensively. For the regions with a larger 
                                    Ψ
                                 , the eigenfunction value stays similar. Therefore, we choose 
                                    Ψ
                                    =
                                    
                                       
                                          e
                                       
                                       
                                          K
                                       
                                    
                                 , so the intensive variation of eigenfunctions only happens across concave creases and the regions surrounded by them are segmented as patches; and


                                 
                                    Ψ
                                    =
                                    
                                       
                                          e
                                       
                                       
                                          −
                                          H
                                       
                                    
                                  for segmenting concave regions from smooth surfaces. Some concave regions we want to segment may not be surrounded by obvious concave creases or convex ridges, such as the three shallow concave regions in the Disk model in Fig. 3. These concave regions have negative 
                                    H
                                 , so we choose 
                                    Ψ
                                    =
                                    
                                       
                                          e
                                       
                                       
                                          −
                                          H
                                       
                                    
                                  to set a large 
                                    Ψ
                                  in them and a small 
                                    Ψ
                                  for the remaining surface. As a result, the eigenfunction value stays similar inside the concave regions, and we segment each of them as a patch.

Compared with the LBO eigenfunctions in Fig. 2(a), the SLO eigenfunctions in Fig. 4(a), (b) are more sensitive to the variation of surface curvatures, which perform better in determining the patch boundaries in the segmentation results in (c), (d). For a certain object, the choice of 
                           Ψ
                         depends on specific purposes. For example when 
                           Ψ
                           =
                           1
                        , the horn of Elk is separated into two planar regions in (c), which may be desired for design or manufacturing. But for structure recognition, the result in (d) may be preferred because the horn is a single solid component.

Analogy to the definition of GHO in Eq. (6), we introduce a 
                        generalized Giaquinta–Hildebrandt operator (GGHO)
                     , which is defined as

                        =
                        0.1
                     ). Since GGHO is defined based on the second fundamental form of the surface, it is more sensitive to the curvature-related features compared with LBO, which is defined based on the first fundamental form. Fig. 5
                      shows the smoothing results for the Moai model based on the LBO and GGHO. Compared with LBO, some sharp edges such as the lower jaw and the eyebrow are preserved and sharpened using GGHO.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, various models are tested using our surface segmentation and geometric flow methods. All the results are generated using a computer with an Intel Xeon E5-1620 CPU, a Nvidia GeForce GTX680 graphic card, and 16 GB of memory. Table 1
                      shows a summary of the computation of eigenfunctions and segmentation results for LBO and SLO.


                     Surface segmentation using
                     
                        Ψ
                        =
                        1
                     
                     and
                     
                        Ψ
                        =
                        
                           
                              e
                           
                           
                              K
                           
                        
                     . To segment objects with both concave creases and convex ridges, we choose the SLO eigenfunctions with 
                        Ψ
                        =
                        1
                     . Fig. 6
                      shows the first five eigenfunctions and the corresponding segmentation results of the Moai model. As shown in (e), the segmentation from the first two modes of SLO only roughly captures several major regions of the Moai model. As higher modes are used, detailed features are captured. When all the first five eigenfunctions are used, we can tell two different components of the nose, see (h). In contrast, the LBO eigenfunctions cannot detect these concave crease or convex ridge features as shown in (d). Fig. 7
                      shows a CAD model, the Rockerarm. Again, we can observe that the SLO eigenfunctions segment the smooth regions surrounded by concave creases and convex ridges.

For objects with only concave creases, we choose 
                        Ψ
                        =
                        
                           
                              e
                           
                           
                              K
                           
                        
                     . To reveal the differences between the SLO and other operators, we adopt the PAM clustering method to compute the segmentation results from the eigenfunctions of LBO, concavity-aware Laplacian (CL)  [11] and SLO. Triangle meshes are generated for the CL eigenfunction computation by splitting each quadrilateral element into two triangles. Since the vertex number is not changed, the computational time for the CL is similar with LBO and SLO. The segmentation results can be evaluated quantitatively using the Princeton benchmark and software  [30], by comparing them with the ground truth from human. There are four metrics  [30] to measure the quality of segmentation results: 
                        
                           1.

                                       e
                                    
                                    
                                       D
                                    
                                 
                              , which is the sum of distance between points along the cuts in the computed segmentation to the closest cuts in the ground truth segmentation, and vice-versa;

                                       e

                              , which measures the overall difference between the patches in different segmentation results;

the Rand index 
                                 
                                    
                                       e
                                    
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                 
                              , which measures the likelihood that a random pair of elements are in the same patch or not in different segmentation results; and

the consistency error 
                                 
                                    
                                       e
                                    
                                    
                                       C
                                    
                                 
                              , which measures the hierarchical similarities and differences of different segmentation results.

Various surface segmentation methods have been developed besides eigenfunction-based schemes. In Figs. 8–11, our method is also compared with the shape diameter function (SDF) method  [31], which segments the surface according to the distribution of shape diameter. Due to the sensitivity of SLO eigenfunctions to the surface creases, our method yields higher quality results than the SDF method for most of the models such as the Octopus, Bust and Human-A models, except for the Human-B model where the main components in the ground truth are connected smoothly.

                     . Protein pockets are concave regions on the biomolecular surface, which determine the interactions between the protein and other molecules. Detecting and segmenting these pockets are essentially important to predict the behavior of biomolecules during the biological process. Since the pockets are concave regions on the smooth protein surface, we adopt 
                        Ψ
                        =

                     Fig. 12
                      shows the results of 1BYH, a protein widely used for enzyme behavior study. (a), (b) show the eigenfunctions of LBO and SLO, respectively. Their segmentation results are shown in (c), (d). It is obvious that the SLO eigenfunctions segment the concave and convex regions well, while the LBO eigenfunctions cannot. In (d), we choose the patch with negative average mean curvature as the pocket (Patch D), which is further subdivided into two smaller patches in (e) when two more eigenfunctions are considered.

The protein pockets are candidates for active sites where the protein binds with other molecules. We can use the bound structure to determine the real active sites, and also use them to validate our segmentation results. Fig. 12(f) shows a known binding between 1BYH and a small molecule BETA-D-GLUCOSE. Let

                     Limitations. Since the SLO and GGHO are defined based on the second fundamental form, a high-order representation of the surface is required to compute the eigenfunctions of SLO and perform the GGHO-based smoothing, which are more complicated in computation compared with other LBO-based methods. In this paper, we use the Catmull–Clark basis functions and quadrilateral control meshes to represent the surface, so a remeshing process is required for other forms of input meshes. The cross field-based surface parameterization may fail in generating quadrilateral meshes when the input triangle meshes contain many complicated features, which limits the applications of our method.

In this paper, two new geometric operators, namely the secondary Laplace operator (SLO) and generalized Giaquinta–Hildebrandt operator (GGHO), have been introduced based on the second fundamental form of the surface. The eigenfunctions of SLO are sensitive to curvature-related surface features, which segment the surface with concave creases/regions and convex ridges detected. Based on the GGHO, a new geometric flow method has been developed for surface smoothing, which preserves and strengthens sharp features on the surface.

In this paper, surface segmentation is introduced mainly to show the special properties of the SLO eigenfunctions. In the future, we plan to develop more robust segmentation algorithms and explore other applications of the SLO eigenfunctions. On the other hand, since most of the surfaces are still represented by triangle meshes, we also plan to investigate the implementation of these new operators on triangle meshes.
