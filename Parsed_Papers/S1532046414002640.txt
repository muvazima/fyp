                  Background
                  Metabolomics is an emerging field that includes ascertaining a metabolic profile from a combination of small molecules, and which has health applications. Metabolomic methods are currently applied to discover diagnostic biomarkers and to identify pathophysiological pathways involved in pathology. However, metabolomic data are complex and are usually analyzed by statistical methods. Although the methods have been widely described, most have not been either standardized or validated. Data analysis is the foundation of a robust methodology, so new mathematical methods need to be developed to assess and complement current methods. We therefore applied, for the first time, the dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) to metabolomics data; we also assessed the complementarity of this method with standard statistical methods. Some attributes were transformed in a way allowing us to discover global and local monotonic relationships between condition and decision attributes. We used previously published metabolomics data (18 variables) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and non-ALS patients.
               
               
                  Results
                  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) allowed satisfactory discrimination (72.7%) between ALS and non-ALS patients. Some discriminant metabolites were identified: acetate, acetone, pyruvate and glutamine. The concentrations of acetate and pyruvate were also identified by univariate analysis as significantly different between ALS and non-ALS patients. DRSA correctly classified 68.7% of the cases and established rules involving some of the metabolites highlighted by OPLS-DA (acetate and acetone). Some rules identified potential biomarkers not revealed by OPLS-DA (beta-hydroxybutyrate). We also found a large number of common discriminating metabolites after Bayesian confirmation measures, particularly acetate, pyruvate, acetone and ascorbate, consistent with the pathophysiological pathways involved in ALS.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  DRSA provides a complementary method for improving the predictive performance of the multivariate data analysis usually used in metabolomics. This method could help in the identification of metabolites involved in disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, these different strategies mostly identified the same metabolites as being discriminant. The selection of strong decision rules with high value of Bayesian confirmation provides useful information about relevant condition–decision relationships not otherwise revealed in metabolomics data.
               
            

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

Metabolomics is defined as the study of all metabolites in a system, and includes the identification of metabolic signatures from a combination of small molecules in biological fluid. This emerging “omics” approach is increasingly used in medicine to find diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of diseases and to identify pathophysiological pathways involved in these pathologies. The methods involve studying metabolites across a large spectrum of concentrations, polarity and masses [1–3], based on high-throughput techniques [4]. “Untargeted” metabolomics is based on metabolic profiles without systematic identification of metabolites included in this profile, and “targeted” methodologies focus on specific metabolites. Whatever the approach, data preprocessing and analysis are the foundation of a robust methodology. There has been increasing work in bioinformatics to try to standardize these steps [5–8]. The greatest risk associated with high-throughput techniques is mishandling multiple and complex data, leading to biased results. Multivariate statistical analysis including Principal Component Analysis (PCA: the aims of which include description) and Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA: for predictions) are the most widely used statistical methodologies in “omics” studies. However, standard criteria to validate the models are often unavailable. Efforts have to be made to validate the models statistically or to validate this strategy using another mathematical approach. Internal validation based on cross-validation with the current cohort is the most common strategy; external validation based on experiments performed on another platform using samples from a different origin is rare. Consequently, it would be valuable to test different methods of statistical treatment to assess the similarity of the biomarkers identified and the performance of predictive models. Also, it would be helpful to provide the proof of concept that different mathematical tools could be used to analyze metabolomics data.

Knowledge discovery from data describing a piece of the real or an abstract world is a field of computer science: it involves the process of searching the data automatically for patterns that can be considered knowledge about this piece of the world. The patterns are evidenced by induction some “condition–decision” relationships hidden in the data. The most natural representation of these relationships is by “if...,then...” decision rules relating some conditions on independent variables (called condition attributes) to some decisions on a dependent variable (called the decision attribute). The same representation of patterns is used in multi-attribute classification, and therefore the data searched for discovery of these patterns can be seen as classification data.

In this paper, we analyze metabolomics data using the standard descriptive and predictive methodologies (PCA and OPLS-DA). We also adopt the classification perspective to apply an original methodology based on dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) to induction of “condition-decision” relationships from the data and representing them by so-called monotonic decision rules. The DRSA was never applied to metabolomics. Consequently, we assessed the complementarity and the usefulness of the novel concept of analyzing metabolomics data by DRSA; this included testing for the potential concordance of results between DRSA and standard statistical methods of metabolomics data treatment, particularly in the identification of relevant variables (condition attributes). We used some data from targeted metabolomics investigations: 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis of cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and non-ALS patients. Some of these data were published previously [9]. The ultimate aims of this project were to discriminate ALS patients and non-ALS subjects, and to identify the variables relevant for this discrimination.

This study is the first to apply the DRSA to the analysis of metabolomics data and to assess the “added value” of this method over standard statistical methods.

@&#METHODS@&#

The methodology for collection, handling and analysis of CSF samples and for NMR acquisition has been described elsewhere [9]. Briefly, we collected 50 samples from ALS patients at the time of diagnosis and 49 from non-ALS subjects. Information on age at onset and gender were obtained for each subject. The 1H NMR spectra were acquired with a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer (Bruker SADIS, Wissembourg, France). Data were processed using XWinNMR version 3.5 software (Bruker Daltonik, Karlsruhe, Germany). Metabolite peaks were determined with the ERETIC peak as a quantitative reference.

We quantified (by XWin NMR software) 17 CSF metabolites in ALS and non ALS patients, defined as follows: amino-acids (alanine, glutamine, tyrosine), organic acids (citrate, acetate, α-hydroxybutyrate (AHBT)), ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBT), acetone, acetoacetate), glucose, fructose, metabolites involved in glucose metabolism (pyruvate, lactate), creatinine and creatine, recently identified as markers of mitochondrial dysfunction [10], the anti-oxidant molecule ascorbate, formate, and ethanol. Thus, we obtained the following data for each subject: age, gender, concentrations of the CSF metabolites (additional file 1).

Wilcoxon tests and t-tests were used to compare CSF metabolite concentrations between ALS and non ALS patients to identify disturbances in metabolic pathways associated with ALS. We also compared sex and age between the two groups. A correction for multiple tests (Bonferroni adjustment) was applied to adjust the p values by accounting for the 19 parameters evaluated in the analysis. Differences were considered as significant when p
                        <0.0026. JMP statistical software version 7.0.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) was used for all statistical analyses.

Multivariate analysis was performed on metabolomics data using Simca-P+-13. We used Pareto scaling (Par), obtained by dividing each variable by the square root of its standard deviation. Logarithmic transformation was used to minimise the impact of both noise and high variance of the variables [11]. After these transformations, data were used for unsupervised principal components analysis (PCA) [12] to identify similarities or differences between sample profiles. PCA uses a vector space transform to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets. The starting point for PCA is a matrix of data characterized by N observations (rows) and X variables (columns). PCA is used to represent a multivariate data table as a low-dimensional plane to provide an overview of the data. Thus, it reveals groups of observations, trends, and outliers, and uncovers the relationships between observations and variables, and between variables themselves. PCA finds lines, planes, and hyperplanes in the X-dimensional space that approximate the data in the least square sense.

Spectral variation was reduced to a series of principal components (PC), each representing correlated spectral differences, and summarized in a score plot. PCs, new variables that are orthogonal to each other, explained progressively less variance in the data set. The PCs were displayed in a two-dimensional score plot, allowing visualization of the distribution and grouping of the samples in the new variable space. Score plots were inspected visually for grouping, trends in the data. The goodness of fit explains how well we are able to reproduce mathematically the data of the data set. A quantitative measure of the goodness of fit is given by the parameter R
                        2
                        X (=the explained variation, goodness of fit) and the predicted variation Q2X (goodness of prediction).

Orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS) is a modification of the PLS regression analysis method. The OPLS method can separate the systematic variation in the X variable into two parts: (1) that which is linearly related to Y, and (2) that which is orthogonal to Y. Both PLS and OPLS methods are supervised statistical methods whereas PCA is not. Supervised and unsupervised modeling techniques are suitable for metabolomics because they can manage large numbers of variables for small sample sizes and simultaneously be able to take into account multicollinearity and missing values. Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) evaluates variations in frame areas between groups: variation in the measured data can be partitioned into two blocks by the program, one containing variations that correlate with the class identifier and the other containing variations that are orthogonal to the first block and thus do not contribute to discrimination between the groups [13]. Next, we created a score plot to visualize the OPLS-DA model and characterize the contribution of variables to the separation of classes using the loading plot and the contribution plot. The contribution plot of scores shows variation which is explained, i.e., which variables contribute to the model. OPLS-DA was cross validated by withholding one-seventh of the samples in seven successive simulations such that each sample was omitted once to guard against over fitting [14]. This approach meant that the OPLS-DA was built from one “predictive” component and two or more orthogonal components. Q
                        2 and R
                        2 indicate the robustness of the model. R
                        2 is defined as a fraction of the variance explained by a component. Cross validation of R
                        2 gives Q
                        2, which represents the proportion of total variation predicted by a component. Thus, the R
                        2 indicates how well the variation of a variable is explained and Q
                        2 how well a variable could be predicted and estimated by cross validation (i.e., the accuracy of prediction). We evaluated the Q
                        2/R
                        2 overview plot to identify the cumulative R
                        2 and Q
                        2 values for each variable. Metabolites that are well modeled have R
                        2 and Q
                        2 values>0.5. The predicted data were then compared with the original data and the sum of squared errors calculated for the whole dataset. This is called the Predicted Residual Sum of Squares (PRESS), and low values of PRESS indicate good prediction by the model. For convenience, we then converted PRESS into Q
                        2 to resemble the scale of the R
                        2: PRESS were divided by the initial sum of squares and subtracted from 1. Good predictions have low PRESS and therefore high Q
                        2.

The quality of the models is described by the cumulative modeled variation in the X matrix (metabolites) or R
                        2
                        X(cum), the cumulative modeled variation in the Y matrix (CSF samples) or R
                        2
                        Y(cum), and the cross validated predictive ability or Q
                        2(cum) values. Models were rejected if there was complete overlap of Q
                        2 distributions (Q
                        2(cum)<0) or low classification rates (Q
                        2(cum)<0.05 and eigenvalues>2). We considered a model robust if Q
                        2
                        >40% and R
                        2
                        >50%, but the relevance of these cut off values needs to be confirmed under biological conditions. The set of multiple models resulting from the cross validation was used to calculate jack-knife uncertainty measures [15]. The jack-knife method is a non-parametric method widely used for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic. Given a sample dataset and a desired statistic, the jack-knife works by computing the desired statistic with an element removed from the equation. Thus, jack-knife standard error of the predicted scores is computed from all the cross validation rounds.

The predicted data were then compared with the original data and the sum of squared errors calculated for the whole dataset. We fixed the maximum number of iterations at 200 to ensure convergence of the OPLS algorithm [16]. A misclassification table was generated to show the proportion of correctly classified observations in the dataset (ALS vs non-ALS patients). We evaluated the performance of the predictive model using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). We also calculated the Matthews correlation coefficient to evaluate the prediction. We built the models from the 17 metabolites and age (18 independent variables). The Variable Importance Parameter (VIP) values summarize the overall contribution of each X-variable to the model, summed over all components and weighted according to the Y variation accounted for by each component. Thus, VIP ranks the compounds (metabolites) according to their contribution to the model, and variable selection ensured the involvement of the most relevant VIP in the final model.

We also drew a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve from the Ypred values obtained with the best OPLS-DA model. We calculated the cut-off of the YPred value and the associated sensitivity and specificity for classifying ALS patients.

Data from targeted metabolomics investigations of cerebrospinal fluids from ALS patients and non-ALS subjects can be considered to be classification data, where concentrations of particular metabolites are condition attributes (independent variables), and ALS or non-ALS are class labels assigned to individuals by a decision attribute (dependent variable). To explain the class assignment in terms of condition attributes, we used the rough set concept [17], and its particular extension called Dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) [18–21]. DRSA proved to be an effective tool in analysis of classification data which are partially inconsistent [22,23]. In the context of our study, inconsistency means that two individuals have similar concentrations of metabolites although one is in the ALS class, and the other is in the non-ALS class. The rough sets representing ALS and non-ALS classes discern between consistent and inconsistent individuals and prepare the ground for induction of decision rules. DRSA assumes that the value sets of condition attributes are ordered and monotonically dependent on the order of decision classes. As a consequence, the rules derived from data structured using the concept of the DRSA are monotonic, which means that they have the following syntax:

“if at
                           i
                        (patient)⩾val

                         is an h-th condition attribute and val
                           h
                         is a threshold value of this attribute which makes an elementary condition at
                           h
                        (patient)⩾val

                         entering the condition part of a rule indicating the assignment of a patient to either class ALS or non-ALS, respectively. In the above syntax of the rules, it is assumed that value sets of all condition attributes are numerical and ordered such that the greater the value, the more likely it is that the patient is ALS; analogously, it is assumed that the smaller the value, the more likely it is that the patient is non-ALS. Attributes ordered in this way are called gain-type. Cost-type attributes have value sets ordered in the opposite direction, such that elementary conditions on these attributes have opposite relation signs. In case of metabolomics data, it is not possible to know a priori if concentrations of metabolites are gain or cost attributes, and therefore we proceeded as described in [24]: each original attribute is considered in two copies, with the first copy assumed to be gain-type, and the second cost-type. The applied transformation of data is non-invasive, i.e., it does not bias the relationships identified between condition attributes and the decision attribute. Then, the induction algorithm constructs decision rules involving elementary conditions on one or both copies of particular attributes. For example, for a rule indicating the assignment of a patient to class ALS, the following elementary conditions concerning attribute at

Rules are characterized by their strength defined as a ratio of the number of patients matching the condition part of the rule to the total number of patients in the sample.

Sets of decision rules, which are essential for the analysis, were induced from metabolomics data transformed as described above and structured according to the DRSA. The induction algorithm is called VC-DomLEM [25]; it was implemented as a software package called jMAF (http://idss.cs.put.poznan.pl/site/139.html), based on the java Rough Set (jRS) library. The sets of rules induced were used to construct component classifiers in variable consistency bagging [26,27]. Variable consistency bagging (VC-bagging) was applied to increase the accuracy of results produced by VC-DomLEM. Both rule relevance and attribute relevance in rules were estimated by measuring Bayesian confirmation, as described in [28]. In this process, decision rules are induced repetitively on bootstrap samples and tested with data from individuals who were not included in the samples. Let us interpret a rule as a consequence relation “if E, then H”, where E denotes rule premise, and H rule conclusion. For rule relevance, the Bayesian confirmation measure quantifies the contribution of rule premise E to correct classification of unseen individuals. Many Bayesian confirmation measures have been described in the literature, of which we used the measure s(H, E). This approach allows clear interpretation in terms of a difference of conditional probabilities involving H and E, i.e., s(H, E)=Pr(H|E)−Pr(H|E), where probability Pr(⋅) is estimated from the test samples of patients. For the relevance of single attributes, the Bayesian confirmation measure quantifies the degree to which the presence of attribute at
                           i
                         in premise E, denoted by at
                           i

                        E, provides evidence for or against conclusion H of the rule. Here, we again used measure s(H, at
                           i

                        E), which, in this case, is defined as follows, s(H, at
                           i

                        E). Consequently, attributes present in the premise of a rule that assigns patients correctly, or attributes absent from the condition part of a rule that assigns patients incorrectly, are indicated as more relevant.

We assessed the percentages of predictions that were correct for OPLS-DA models and DRSA. The VIP identified by the PCA and OPLS-DA models were compared with the metabolites found to be important by the rules established from DRSA. Unfortunately, we could not perform a robust cross-validation between these methods because numerous parameters are not available for modification using SIMCA software and we were not able to parameter all the same criteria for DRSA and OPLS-DA models.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

There was no significant difference in mean age between the groups (59.7±10.6years for ALS patients vs. 63.9±14.5years for non-ALS individuals, p
                        =0.09). The percentage of men was similar in the two groups (64% in the ALS group vs. 55.10% in the non-ALS group, p
                        =0.41). The concentrations of acetate were lower (mean±SD: 174±159μmol/L vs. 84±101μmol/L (p
                        <0.0001)) in ALS patients than non-ALS individuals. After Bonferroni adjustment, there was a trend for the acetone concentration to be higher in ALS patients (13.4±12.2μmol/L vs. 8.7±8.2μmol/L, p
                        =0.02). There was a trend for the glutamine concentration to be lower in ALS patients (652±225 vs. 790±348, p
                        =0.03). The concentrations of pyruvate were higher (58±37μmol/L vs. 39±48, p
                        =0.0026) in ALS patients than in non-ALS individuals. A color map was generated from the p-values for correlations between variables and revealed that all the variables were highly correlated (Additional file 2).

The resulting PCA score plot showed that the two first PCs explained 64.1% of the variation of the selected metabolites (Fig. 1
                        A). ALS and non-ALS individuals formed separate clusters in the PCA scores plot of the quantitative data. To summarize, each spectrum can be viewed as an observation in the PCA space where the proximity of observations represents the similarity of the metabolic profiles of CSF samples. The contribution score plot (Fig. 1B) identified the relative importance of each variable to differentiating ALS from non-ALS individuals. The Q2/R2 overview plot indicated that 76.4% of the metabolites were well modeled (Additional file 3).

The performance of the model including the 17 metabolites and age was satisfactory: prediction was correct in 72.73% of cases (sensitivity: 78%; specificity: 67.3%; PPV: 70.9%; NPV: 75.0%; additional file 4). The Matthews correlation coefficient for the diagnosis prediction using these data was 0.46. Handling of metabolomics data is based on the optimization of the predictive model through the selection of variables. This approach provides the best performance criteria of the models. As the number of variables is high with respect to the size of the cohort, the maximal reduction of the number of metabolites selected leads to the most rigorous results.

From the predictive variation between X (metabolites, age) and Y (CSF samples) given by R
                        2
                        X(cum), the best model used four components, and interpreted approximately 99.9% of the total variation in X. Pareto scaling of the models created by OPLS-DA (Fig. 2
                        A), explained approximately 24.5% of the variations in the various samples (R
                        2
                        Y(cum)). We found the predictive value of the models to be low (Q
                        2(cum)=0.167). The cross-validation performance was confirmed by analysis of variance (CV-)ANOVA (median p-value=0.021). The contribution score plot (Fig. 2B) identified the relative importance of each compound to differentiating ALS from non-ALS individuals, and showed that high levels of acetone and pyruvate, and low levels of glutamine and acetate allowed discrimination. The loading scatter plot (Fig. 3
                        ) showing which variables were expressed differently between ALS and non-ALS patients confirmed these results. The VIP panel including these four metabolites predicted the diagnostic group with mean probability of 76.8%, with 82% specificity, 72% sensitivity, 80% PPV, and 74.1 NPV. The Matthews correlation coefficient for the diagnosis prediction using these data was 0.54. Although the performance criteria of the model are not excellent, the predictive ability of the model is satisfactory. The AUC value obtained from the ROC curve is 0.79 and defines a cut-off was a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 69.5%. Note that there is currently no diagnostic biomarker for this disease. Despite the percentage of predictions that are correct is only moderate, this methodology nevertheless represents significant progress. However, this strategy is highly optimistic: fitting a PLS model using VIP identified in a previous step corresponds to statistical variable selection coupled with a PLS predictor. This strategy provides artificially optimistic cross-validation results, as the Q
                        2 value is derived only for the second PLS model alone, not for the combined two-step “variable selection+PLS predictor” model.

Nevertheless, the metabolites identified as discriminative were the same as those identified by univariate analysis as being significantly different or having a trend toward being different between the two groups (including, glutamine and acetone).

The model constructed by VC-bagging with VC-DomLEM component classifiers showed good classification performance in threefold stratified cross validation, which was repeated 100 times for a better repeatability. On average, 68.7% of cases were correctly classified (sensitivity: 70%, and specificity: 67.3%, Matthews correlation coefficient: 0.37). The values of the Bayesian confirmation measure calculated for all variables (condition attributes) gave more insight into the constructed classification model (Fig. 4
                        ). The variables with the highest values of confirmation are those which are the most relevant from the viewpoint of correct prediction by the DRSA rule model. Importantly, we found that the metabolites identified as the most relevant by the Bayesian confirmation were the same as those revealed to be discriminative by univariate analysis and OPLS-DA.

The rules induced from the information table structured using DRSA represent relevant patterns of condition–decision relationships, which are free of inessential and redundant information. Some of the most relevant of all the rules that constitute the DRSA model are as follows.

1: if Acetate⩾0.125 and Ascorbate⩽0.01964669 then patient is not ALS;

{strength: 0.21, confirmation s
                        =0.57}

2: if Gln⩾0.804629579 and Acetone⩽0.007626821 then patient is not ALS;

{strength: 0.11, confirmation s
                        =0.37}

3: if Pyruvate⩽0.029593053 and Crn⩾0.192354842 then patient is not ALS;

{strength: 0.09, confirmation s
                        =0.2}

4: if Acetate⩽0.055457394 and Ascorbate⩽0.0786 then patient is ALS;

{strength: 0.25, confirmation s
                        =0.55}

5: if Acetone ∈ [0.0087; 0.009534583] then patient is ALS;

{strength: 0.04, confirmation s
                        =0.5}

6: Alanine⩽0.039024531 and Pyruvate⩾0.0326 then patient is ALS;

{strength: 0.08, confirmation s
                        =0.55}

The different approaches all led to identification of the same metabolites as being relevant. Although the parameters of internal validation are different, including the number of repetitions and the content of validation samples, the performance (correct prediction percentage) and the relevance of the findings (metabolites identified) are very similar.

First, the results of diagnosis prediction by DRSA are similar to those by the OPLS-DA model, and are satisfactory for a disease of this complexity. Note, however, that one of the limitations of OPLS-DA is that the internal validation may be too optimistic (additional file 5).

According to the descriptive methods of the DRSA, the most relevant metabolites for explaining ALS are low concentration of acetate (<55μmol/L in the rules, and the median is 88μmol/L), and high concentration of pyruvate (>32.6μmol/L in the rules and the median is 34.9μmol/L); although, alanine was not relevant in the PCA and was not identified as significantly different between ALS and non-ALS groups by univariate analysis, it appears to be important when associated with high levels of pyruvate. We also found the same metabolites, with an inverse relationship to those for ALS, to be relevant to describing non-ALS: DRSA confirmed the relevance of high acetate and low ascorbate concentrations for the non-ALS group; and high concentrations of glutamine associated with low concentrations of acetone were relevant to explain the non-ALS patients. Although creatine–creatinine were not found to be relevant by the PCA and did not differ statistically significantly between ALS and non-ALS groups in univariate analysis, this metabolite pair appears important when associated with low levels of pyruvate. This further implicates pyruvate in the pathogenesis of ALS. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ALS is associated with a disturbance in glucose metabolism [9,29,30].

Some metabolites, for example beta-hydroxybutyrate, are involved in a large number of the rules obtained from DRSA (additional file 6). Surprisingly, beta-hydroxybutyrate was not identified as relevant by other methods. However, this finding is entirely consistent with the involvement of acetate and acetone in the predictive models. All these metabolites are ketone bodies, as demonstrated by Kumar et al. [31] in a metabolomics study with serum from ALS patients. Interestingly, some variables are involved in some rules but the range of values are opposite, dependent on the other variables associated in this rule (for example, predictive rules to explain the pathology include high values of beta-hydroxybutyrate when associated with high values of acetone but also low values of beta-hydroxybutyrate when associated with high values of ascorbate). Such observations may be very useful for the interpretation of biochemical pathways, because they reveal the dynamism and the kinetics of the overall metabolism.

Second, we also found a large number of common discriminating metabolites after Bayesian confirmation measures were computed for each of 18 variables: they include acetate, pyruvate, acetone and ascorbate. Although ascorbate was not highly discriminative in the final OPLS-DA model, the concentration of ascorbate tends to be higher in ALS patients and it is the third most important metabolite in the OPLS-DA model including all variables. The involvement of ascorbate, considered to be an anti-oxidant compound, is consistent with the oxidative stress associated with the pathogenesis of ALS [32,33].

The dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) provides a complementary means for analyzing metabolomics data. It could be useful as a diagnostic tool, complementary to the models already widely used in the field of metabolomics and other investigative techniques, particularly clinical and/or imaging explorations. Above all, this approach could help identify metabolites involved in the pathogenesis of a disease. This work provides the proof of concept that diverse mathematical tools can contribute to the analysis of metabolomics data. In particular, the ability to suggest mechanistic explanations about pathophysiological pathways is promising. DRSA seems to be more suitable than SIMCA methods for interpreting relevant metabolites, and the relationships between metabolites and particular subgroups of patients. Moreover, the possibility of establishing strong decision rules with high value of Bayesian confirmation provides useful information about relevant condition–decision relationships hidden in metabolomics data. Thus, we suggest that both methods are useful and may be applied separately or together, depending on the objectives of the study: prediction of diagnosis or elucidating pathophysiological pathways.

In the dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) [22], information about objects from set U (targeted metabolomics of cerebrospinal fluids from ALS and non-ALS subjects) is represented in the form of an information table. In the set of attributes there is a set A of condition attributes and a single decision attribute. Condition attributes whose value sets are ordered are called ordinal attributes. Without loss of generality, for ordinal attribute at ∈ A, φ: U→R, for all objects x, y ∈ U, φ(x)⩾
                     φ(y) means “x is evaluated at least as high as y on ordinal attribute at”. Decision attribute d is also ordinal. Values of d make a partition of U into a finite number of decision classes, X
                     ={Xt
                     , t
                     =1, …, n}, such that each x ∈ U belongs to one and only one class Xt
                      ∈ X. It is supposed that the classes are ordered, i.e., for all r, s ∈ {1, …, n}, such that r
                     >
                     s, the objects from Xr
                      are in a higher class than those from Xs
                     .

In general, ordinal attribute may have positive or negative monotonic relationship with the decision attribute d (which is also ordinal). A positive relationship means that the greater the value of the condition attribute the higher the class label (i.e. the value of the decision attribute), and a negative relationship means that the greater the value of the condition attribute the lower the class label. The ordinal classification problem, for which positive or negative monotonic relationships between ordinal condition attributes and the decision attribute are present, is called ordinal classification with monotonicity constraints.
