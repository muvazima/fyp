                  Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in the world. Several computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems have been used to assist health experts identify suspicious areas that are difficult to perceive with the human eye, thus aiding in the detection and diagnosis of cancer. This work proposes a methodology for the discrimination and classification of regions extracted from mammograms as mass and non-mass. The Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) was used in this work for the acquisition of mammograms. The taxonomic diversity index (
                        Δ
                     ) and the taxonomic distinctness (

                     ), which were originally used in ecology, were used to describe the texture of the regions of interest. These indexes were computed based on phylogenetic trees, which were applied to describe the patterns in regions of breast images. Two approaches were used for the analysis of texture: internal and external masks. A support vector machine was used to classify the regions as mass and non-mass. The proposed methodology successfully classified the masses and non-masses, with an average accuracy of 98.88%.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Breast cancer has the highest incidence of all cancers in the female population [1]. According to [2], it is also the type of cancer that kills the most women. The best known method for preventing breast cancer is early diagnosis, which lowers the mortality rate and enhances treatment efficiency.

One prevention method is the mammographic exam. The results of this exam are analyzed by specialists (radiologists), i.e., physicians who are able to diagnose diseases from images. This step is a sensitive stage because the same exam can be interpreted differently, depending on the expert. The exam is also a repetitive task that demands a high level of attention to the smallest details.

The sensitivity of mammograms varies between approximately 70% and 90%, depending on the following factors: size and location of the lesion, density of the breast tissue, patient age, exam quality and the radiologists interpretation ability [3]. The only way to ensure that a certain region is cancer is by a biopsy.

For these reasons, in recent decades, there has been an increasing interest in the development and use of mammographic image processing techniques, with the primary objectives of increasing diagnostic precision and providing a second opinion to physicians. These techniques have been used to develop computer-aided detection/computer-aided diagnostic (CAD/CADx) systems.

Various studies on increasing the accuracy rates of breast cancer detection with CAD systems have been reported. Three important common points in these studies are a high number of false positives, a high rate of false negatives and a reduced number of cases in the evaluation, which provides a better conclusion. Therefore, there is a continuous and necessary need for the development of CAD systems to support breast mass classification. In Section 2 and Table 5 we provide a summary of each work.

In most CAD methodologies, the feature extraction stage is based on either geometry, for example, how round is the candidate, or on texture, which describes aspects of the candidate based on gray level distribution. For our methodology, we use only texture features.

Diversity is term frequently used in Ecology. The objective is to describe the variety of species present in a community or area. A community is defined as a set of species that occur in a certain location and at a certain time [4]. Phylogeny is a branch of Biology concerned with studying the evolutionary relationships between species, by verifying the relationships among them, in order to determine possible common ancestors. A phylogenetic tree, or simply a phylogeny, is a tree in which the leaves represent the organisms and the internal nodes represent possible ancestors. The edges of the tree denote the evolutionary relationships [5].

Taxonomic diversity and distinction indices were used for describing the texture of mass and non-mass. The first indexes consider the abundance of the species and the taxonomic relationship between them, whereas the second represents the average taxonomic distance between two individuals of a distinct species. These indexes are based on phylogenetic distance, considering the architecture of a rooted tree in the form of an inclined cladogram. In particular, this work contributes to this field through the use of texture features based on the taxonomic diversity index (
                        Δ
                     ) and the taxonomic distinctness (
                        
                           
                              Δ
                           
                           
                              ⁎
                           
                        
                     ) and by using phylogenetic trees for the classification of regions of the mammogram that were previously segmented as mass and non-mass.

This paper is divided as follows: in Section 3 we present the methodology used to classify the regions of interest extracted from mammographic images as mass and non-mass, using taxonomic indexes for feature extraction and a support vector machine for classification. In Section 4 we show and discuss the results achieved using the proposed methodology. Finally, in Section 5, we present final remarks about this work.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

In recent decades, many studies have focused on the early detection or diagnosis of breast cancer by means of digital mammograms using image processing and pattern recognition techniques. In this section, we provide a brief summary of some works that have a strong connection with the methodology proposed herein. Table 5 summarizes these works.

In [6], a methodology for classification of breast tissues into normal and abnormal based on mammographic images is introduced. The images were obtained from the DDSM database. The texture features were extracted through statistical measures (i.e., variance, standard deviation, mean, mode, reach and smoothness) and the average pixel intensity in the horizontal and vertical directions (i.e., variance, standard deviation, mean, mode, reach and smoothness). Classification was carried out by a three-layer neural network. The maximum accuracy achieved was 92% and 98% using the statistical features and the average pixel intensity, respectively.

In [7], a methodology for classification of breast tissues into normal and abnormal based on mammographic images is introduced. The images were obtained from the DDSM database. For the extraction of texture features, the GLCM was used, through which Haraclick׳s measurements were computed. The classification was carried out by a three-layer neural network, and the maximum accuracy achieved was 96%.

The work presented in Jasmine et al. [8] describes a system that automatically classifies breast cancer based on mammographic images. Images from the Mammograms Image Analysis Society (MIAS) [9] were used in this study. The features were extracted using a Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform. The work reports a mean maximum accuracy of 98.61% for the classification of regions as normal and abnormal, and 88.05% for classification as malignant and benign, using the support vector machine (SVM).

In Nunes et al. [10], a methodology for the detection of masses in mammographic images is presented using images from the DDSM database. The regions of interest were extracted through K-means and the template matching technique. Subsequently, during feature extraction, Simpson׳s diversity index was used and computed using three independent approaches: global, circles and rings. For classification into mass and non-mass, the SVM was used. An accuracy of 83.94%, a sensitivity of 83.24% and a specificity of 84.14% were achieved.

In [11], a methodology for the detection of masses was developed based on Snakules shape descriptors using 312 images from the DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography) [12]. This specialized system produced an area under the ROC curve A
                     
                        z
                      of 0.79.

The methodology presented in [13] describes the classification of breast tissue into mass and non-mass based on regions of interest (ROI) acquired from the DDSM database. The features were extracted by means of Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Gabor wavelet and the efficient coding model based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA). For classification, the SVM was used, achieving an accuracy of 90.07%.

In [14], a methodology for the classification of regions of interest in mammographic images into normal and abnormal was proposed. The images used were from the DDSM database. Regions of interest, either containing lesions or not, were extracted from the images. The dimensions of the regions of interest were 256×256 pixels. Texture feature extraction used six statistical features (mean, standard deviation, smoothness, asymmetry, energy and entropy) and Local binary patterns (LBP). The performance of two classifiers was compared: the SVM and K-nearest neighbors (K-NN). With the K-NN classifier, it was possible to achieve an accuracy of 95.10% using the statistics, 97.06% using LBP, and 97.25% using a combination of statistics and LBP. The maximum accuracy obtained was of 98.63%, which was achieved by combining the statistics, LBP and SVM.

The work presented in [15] describes a system for the classification of breast tissues into mass and non-mass based on mammographic images. The images were acquired from the DDSM database. Texture features were extracted by applying McIntosh׳s diversity index to the areas of interest of the breast. The index was computed using three approaches: histograms, a gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and a Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM). The maximum accuracy achieved was 99.75%, the maximum sensitivity was 99.47% and 100% specificity was achieved for the GLRLM approach.

In [16], a set of 17 geometric shape and edge descriptors was used to characterize the morphology of 939 masses and 613 non-masses extracted from the DDSM. By using the CART classifier, it was possible to achieve accuracy of 95%.

In the work presented in [17], a methodology is described for the classification of ROIs, extracted from the DDSM, into mass and normal tissue by means of texture analysis in different directions and scales, using a Gabor filter and the SVM. The best result achieved was an A
                     
                        z
                     =0.96 ±0.02.

The methodology developed by [18] describes the use of Block Variance of Local Coefficients (BVLC) to describe the texture of masses and non-masses. The SVM classifier was used to classify the ROIs, which were extracted from the Mini-MIAS database, into mass and non-mass. The results achieved an A
                     
                        z
                     =0.93.

In [19], a methodology for the classification of masses is presented. This methodology uses several diversity indexes (Shannon–Wiener, McIntosh, Total Diversity, Brillouin, Simpson, Berger-Parker, J, ED, Hill, Buzas-Gibson, Camargo) to describe the texture of ROIs, extracted from the DDSM, which may or may not contain masses. The classification was carried out by the SVM, resulting in 100% accuracy.

The work in [20] consists of three steps. The first is preprocessing, and the aim is to remove less important structures, such as the chest muscles. The next step is using texture features extracted from contourlet coefficients and then immediately using a genetic algorithm to improve the selection. In the final step, SVM Family classification is used. The best accuracy achieved was 96.6% for images from the MIAS database.

The work developed by [21] demonstrates the application of four features that measure the shape of the mass. Through these features, information such as the spiculation degree of a mass, as well as the chance of such a mass being spiculated, is extracted. This method was used to classify a set of 319 masses, and the accuracy was 89%.

In [22], a CAD tool for the classification, as well as diagnosis, of masses and non-masses is presented. First, separation of the ROIs is performed. Next, the Spherical Wavelet Transform is applied for feature extraction. Finally, the classification stage is carried out using the SVM. To validate the results, the authors used images from the MIAS database, and an accuracy of 96% was achieved.

The classification of the regions of mammograms into mass and non-mass is a critical stage in the development of methodologies for the detection of breast cancer. The related works show that methodologies based on texture features provide a good description of the patterns in mammographic images, and statistical measures are widely used. In addition, the process of pattern recognition using the SVM has shown promising results for facilitating the detection of breast cancer. Furthermore, the process of feature extraction through diversity indexes (McIntosh and Simpson) has also presented good results. In the present work, we intend to improve the description of texture patterns in mammographic images by applying the taxonomic index and SVM to discriminate between regions as mass and non-mass.

In this section we describe the steps of the proposed methodology: image acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, classification and results validation. Fig. 1
                      presents the sequence of these steps.

In the first step, the acquisition of the images is performed. Here, data from normal and abnormal mammograms were obtained, and the regions of interest, which constituted mass and non-mass tissues, were extracted. Next, the regions of interest are submitted to a pre-processing step, which involves the application of a logarithmic enhancement algorithm and a mean filter. In the next stage, the features in each region of interest are extracted, using the taxonomic indexes with various quantization levels. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification as mass and non-mass.

In this work we used digitized mammographic images from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) [12], which is available on the internet. The DDSM database has 2620 exams from patients of various ethnic and racial origins. Each exam has two images of each breast, in the oblique mediolateral and craniocaudal projections. All lesions in the database were marked by specialist physicians and stored in files.

We used 1702 regions of non-mass tissues and 1702 regions of mass tissues (851 benign and 851 malignant ones), for a total of 3404 regions. Fig. 2
                         shows examples of masses and non-masses extracted from the different mammograms. The mass regions were automatically extracted based on the DDSM lesion markings. These markings correspond to analyses made by specialist physicians and indicate the contour points 
                           (
                           x
                           ,
                           y
                           )
                         for each mass present in the mammogram. It is important to stress that for the analysis of texture, we used only the region inside the specialist׳s marking. The non-mass regions were manually extracted in the rectangular shape with different sizes and from random locations of the mammograms among the normal cases of the DDSM database. This procedure of extracting non-masses in rectangular shape does not affect the result because the indexes only describe texture information and not shape. Moreover, this strategy does not affect the feature extraction process because, according to Magurran [4], the taxonomic diversity indexes have the advantage of being independent of the sample effort (number of individuals found).

After acquisition, the images are submitted for a pre-processing step to enhance their features. We used logarithmic non-linear contrast enhancement to improve the quality of the regions and a mean filter with 5×5 mask to eliminate small structures from the regions [23].

After pre-processing, the regions of interest are submitted to the step for texture feature extraction. This stages comprises three sub-stages: (1) quantization, (2) division of the regions into layers using internal and external masks, and (3) creation of the phylogenetic tree and computation of the taxonomic diversity and distinctness indexes. These sub-stages are described in the next sections.

The quantization process turns a set of gray levels with M elements into a set of gray levels with N elements, where 
                           M
                           >
                           N
                        , i.e., the input set of gray levels is divided into subsets called quantizing intervals [23]. We used the quantization process as an approach to combine individuals (pixels) into a smaller number of species (gray levels). Thus, we represent and analyze the image at different gray scale levels. In this work, the images were quantized in 5 gray levels: 256, 128, 64, 32 and 16.

The following sub-stages are applied to the quantized regions. That is, the division of the regions into layers (internal and external mask), the creation of phylogenetic trees and the computation of taxonomic diversity and distinctness indexes are applied on the quantized regions.

After the quantization step, the regions of interest are divided into layers (internal and external mask) and submitted to the sub-stage of texture feature extraction using a phylogenetic tree.

The objective of dividing the region of interest into layers is to perform a local analysis, which is useful because these areas of the layer may supply information that can distinguish masses from non-masses. For example, central pixels may indicate that the origin of the mass and pixels on the border (called partial pixels) can indicate how a mass has grown. Thus, we look for texture features by means of a phylogenetic tree in each layer. We use two approaches to find these layers: internal and external mask. These approaches and the phylogenetic tree are described in the next sections.

This approach is intended to find diversity patterns in the areas close to the border of the regions and in the inner areas. These regions were generated through masks, which are binary images. The first internal mask was determined by binarization of the quantized ROI. The second internal mask is based on successive reductions of the scale of the ROI with respect to the first one while maintaining the center of mass. The scheme for determining the internal masks and consequently their areas of interest is presented in Fig. 3
                           .

In this work we defined a value of 20% for the diminution of scale, as it was verified in tests that the best results were achieved using five image masks with this scaling proportion. Fig. 4
                            shows an example of areas generated for mass and non-mass.

Using the proposed tree, the number of variables extracted with this approach is 25 (5 internal masks×5 quantizations).

This approach is similar to the approach with an internal mask. The external masks are determined by the difference between the internal masks, where the first external mask is determined by the difference between the first and the second internal mask, and so on. In Fig. 5
                            we show the steps for determining the external masks.

We used four external masks for this approach. The number of variables generated with this approach is 20 (4 external masks×5 quantizations) with the use of the proposed tree. An example of the areas generated for mass and non-mass is shown in Fig. 6
                           .

Phylogenetic trees are used in Biology to describe the evolutionary relationships between species. In these trees, the leaves represent the species and the internal nodes represent common ancestors to the species. Thus, it is possible to make an evolutionary connection between species being species. The inclined cladogram is a graphical representation used to describe the phylogenetic relationship between ancestor species [24].

These trees allow the extraction of indexes that connect diversity, richness and parenthood between species [25]. Fig. 7
                            presents an example of apes׳s phylogenetic tree, represented by an inclined cladogram, where one can see that a chimpanzee has a higher phylogenetic proximity to humans than a siamang. In this tree, the leaf nodes are the species being analyzed, the internal nodes correspond to some common ancestor and the edges indicate the phylogenetic distance between two species. By means of phylogenetic trees, we can compute taxonomic indexes that connect the species of a community.

The difference between two randomly chosen organisms in a phylogeny existing within a community is described by the taxonomic diversity (
                              Δ
                           ) and taxonomic distinctness (
                              
                                 
                                    Δ

                           ) indexes [5]. These indexes consider three essential factors: the number of species, the number of individuals and the connectivity structure of the species (number of edges). In this work, we use these two indexes to discriminate mass and non-mass regions.

The taxonomic diversity index (
                              Δ
                           ) considers the abundance of the species and the taxonomic relationship between them. Thus, its value expresses the mean taxonomic distance between any two individuals, randomly picked from the sample [5]. This index is defined by
                              
                                 (1)

                            is the abundance of the jth, s represents the number of species and w
                           
                              ij
                            is the distance from species i to species j in the taxonomic classification.

There are many architectures in the literature that represent the species through trees, such as the architecture of a rooted tree in the shape of an inclined cladogram [26]. In the present work, we adopt this architecture to improve discrimination between the classes mass and non-mass. According to Magurran [4], diversity is increased in a community in which many types of species are present compared to a community in which most of the species belong to the same type. Thus, we call this new architecture a modified rooted tree in the shape of a inclined cladogram (MRTIC). The modification consisted of changing the number of edges on the right side of the ancestor node between the species.

The insertion of these edges allows the computation of the indexes with higher precision, so that they can more accurately measure the taxonomic difference between the species found in the ROI. That is, the purpose of this procedure is to assign weights and distinguish with greater precision the species which present high value differences in the same ROI so that the taxonomic diversity value computed among species in more homogeneous ROIs (masses) would not be as high as the value for the species in more heterogeneous ROIs (non-masses). For a better illustration, we created Fig. 8
                           , which presents an example of the computation of the distance between the species (w
                           
                              ij
                           ) of an ROI using the tree architecture that we developed (Fig. 8a) and using a conventional architecture (Fig. 8a). In a comparison of the results for the difference between the same species, our architecture achieved a higher level of precision, which is directly reflected in the final computation of the indexes and matches the texture pattern found in masses and non-masses.

Phylogenetic trees combined with taxonomic diversity and distinctness indexes are used in Biology to compare the behavior patterns of species in different areas. In our work, we intend to discriminate the tissues of regions in mammographic images. To implement this idea, the first step is to establish a correspondence between the terms used in Biology and our proposed methodology. Table 1
                            shows this correspondence.

In this work, we used the MRTIC to represent the regions of mass and non-mass. To illustrate the use of this tree in our methodology, Fig. 9
                            exemplifies the MRTIC, where the species (maximum number of gray levels in the ROI) have 256 values (0–255). The gray level values of the ROIs (mass and non-mass) of our sample lie in the range from 0 to 255. To build the MRTIC, each gray level corresponds to a species. For example, the gray level with value 0 will be a species called 0, and the gray level with value 200 will be the species called 200. This concept is used for the other gray level values present in the ROIs. The number of individuals (number of pixel values of each species found in the ROI) is 0 for species 0, 10 for species 1, and so on. Fig. 10
                            exemplifies in detail the construction of the phylogenetic tree and the value of the denominator of (1) and (2) for each relationship. The relationships between species are established from left to right (arrow in Fig. 9). Thus, the first relationship is between the species 0 and 1, with two edges connecting them (

                           ), as illustrated in Fig. 10a. In the second relationship there are four edges (

                           ) which connect the species 0 and 2 (Fig. 10b). Next is the relation between species 0 and 3, with six edges (

                           ) are found between species 0 and 4 (Fig. 10d). Then, the last relationship is between species 0 and species 255, which has 510 edges (

                           ).The next species to relate to the other ones is 1, and the first relation occurs not with species 0, but with species 2, and so on.

To summarize, for each area of the internal and external approaches, one MRTIC was specified. For each MRTIC, we extracted the taxonomic diversity and distinctness indexes to serve as a basis for the discrimination between mass and non-mass.

The last stage of the methodology consists of classifying the regions as mass and non-mass. Feature vectors were obtained in the previous step of feature extraction by computing the taxonomic indexes with basis on the phylogenetic tree, which was computed considering the two spatial approaches: internal and external masking. These values are used by the SVM classifier with the radial base function (RBF) [27].

SVM is a powerful, state-of-the-art algorithm with strong theoretical foundations based on the Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory. SVM has strong regularization properties. Regularization refers to the generalization of the model to new data. This characteristic was the main reason for choosing this classifier in our work. The accuracy of an SVM model is highly dependent on the selection of kernel parameters such as C and λ. For a radial basis function (RBF). We used the LibSVM software [28] to estimate both of these parameters. All of the values of the sample were normalized between −1 and 1 to improve the performance of the SVM. This way, we guarantee a shorter processing time without mischaracterizing the original value of the feature [29].

In this work the samples were divided into two groups, training and test, with proportions of 20% and 80%, 40% and 60%, 50% and 50%, 60% and 40% and 80% and 20%. The division was randomly repeated five times to validate the proposed methodology with more precision. All of the values of the sample were normalized between −1 and 1 to improve the performance of the SVM.

The construction of the final model was performed in three ways. In the first model, each ROI is represented by 45 features, which are extracted by means of five quantizations, five internal masks, four external masks and one taxonomic distinctness index (5⁎(5+4)⁎1=45). The second model also uses 45 features to describe each ROI, formed by five quantizations, five internal masks, four external masks and one taxonomic diversity index (5⁎(5+4)⁎ 1=45). Finally, the third model was the result of the junction of models 1 and 2, totalizing 90 features for each ROI.

After the end of the pattern recognition stage, it is necessary to validate the results and discuss possible improvements. Here, validation was performed using metrics commonly used in CAD/CADx systems to analyze the performance of these image processing-based systems. Specifically, the metrics compared were sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and standard deviation with respect to the accuracy of the five random tests [29].

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

This section presents and discusses the results achieved with the methodology proposed herein for classifying regions of interest from mammographic images as mass and non-mass.

The tests were carried out by applying the whole methodology (pre-processing, feature extraction, classification and validation of results). We performed experiments first using only the taxonomic distinctness index and then using only the taxonomic diversity index. Finally, both indexes were combined. Fig. 11
                      provides better visualization and understanding of the flow of all tests performed.

In the experiment using the taxonomic distinctness index (
                        
                           
                              Δ
                           
                           
                              ⁎
                           
                        
                     ), shown in Table 2
                     , we obtained a set with 45 features (5 quantizations×5 internal mask×4 external mask×1 index). This experiment was randomly repeated 5 times, and the best mean accuracy we achieved was 98.88% for the proportion of 60%/40%. The standard deviation was 0.38, indicating that the values do not vary much with respect to the average accuracy. The mean sensitivity and specificity were 98.6% and 98.85%, respectively. The worst result for this experiment, the configuration (20%/80%), presented a mean accuracy of 98.38%, a mean sensitivity of 98.10% and a mean specificity of 98.67%. The standard deviation was of 0.11.

In the experiment with the taxonomic diversity index (
                        Δ
                     ), shown in Table 3
                     , we followed the same steps as in the previous experiment. The total number of features was also 45. For the 60%/40% configuration, which had the best results, the mean accuracy achieved was 98.40%, the mean sensitivity was 98.75%, the mean specificity was 98.05% and the standard deviation was 0.12. The worst case in this experiment was the 20%/80% formulation, which presented a mean accuracy, mean sensitivity and mean specificity of 97.62%, 98.15% and 97.76%, respectively, with a standard deviation 0.42.

The final experiment was a combination of the taxonomic distinctness index (
                        
                           
                              Δ
                           
                           
                              ⁎
                           
                        
                     ) and the taxonomic diversity index (
                        Δ
                     ). Table 4
                      shows the results. In this experiment, we used 90 features (5 quantizations×5 internal mask×4 external mask×2 indexes). The best were obtained with the 40%/60% group, which exhibited an accuracy of 98.67%, a mean sensitivity of 98.56%, a mean specificity of 98.64%, and a standard deviation with respect to the mean accuracy of 0.08. The worst result of this experiment was 98.31%, 98.04% and 98.59% for the mean accuracy, mean sensitivity and mean specificity, respectively, in the 20%/80% proportion. The standard deviation was 0.27.

From the experimental results summarized in Tables 2–4, it is apparent that the best results presented values above 98% for the mean rate of correct detections, 98% for the mean sensitivity, 98% for the mean specificity and a standard deviation with respect to the mean accuracy of between ±1. The highest value found among all of the experiments for the mean accuracy was 98.88%, which was achieved with respect to the taxonomic distinctness index (
                        
                           
                              Δ
                           
                           
                              ⁎
                           
                        
                     ). In all training/test proportions, the results were above 97% for the mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity using the three approaches with taxonomic indexes.

The promising results presented in Tables 2–4 show the high rates of correct detections achieved with the indexes. One of the reasons for this result is the distribution of gray levels in the non-masses, which was more heterogeneous (high diversity, many species) than that of the masses. In other words, the diversity present in a mass region is smaller because there is a uniformity in the gray levels that form the cancerous region, which is in contrast to non-mass regions. Another reason that must be highlighted concerns the quantization process, which makes our method more precise by reducing the diversity of the masses. This phenomenon does not occur in the same proportions with non-mass regions due to the high variety of species. These differences in the number of species present in mass and non-mass regions are strongly highlighted by the computation of the indexes, enabling the SVM to successfully converge in the separation of classes.

The distribution of the gray levels in the ROI of masses is more homogeneous than that of non-masses. We were able to see this when we built histograms of ROIs in masses and non-masses. Fig. 12
                      illustrates examples of these regions. The distribution in Fig. 12a, which presents the histograms of ROIs in masses, is more homogeneous than that in Fig. 12b, which presents the histograms of ROIs in non-masses. Because of this distribution, we made the clusterings through quantization.

By performing quantization, we assured more consistent computation of the indexes of the ROIs of masses than the non-masses. The more homogeneous regions (masses) resulted in a low cost of computation of the index because they do not have many species, a feature which does not propagate to the more heterogeneous regions, which is characteristic of non-masses.

We also plotted a graph (Fig. 13
                     ) that illustrates the behavior of the classification of the ROIs into mass and non-mass, using taxonomic distinctness (
                        Δ
                     ) with various quantization levels (256, 128, 64, 32 and 16 gray levels), with the same image database of 20%/80% previously used in tests. We can see that the clustering with fewer gray levels (species) leads to better results.

In this section we present two cases of failure and two cases of success for the mass/non-mass classes.


                        Fig. 14
                         presents two examples of masses which were analyzed by our methodology. In Fig. 14a, a case of success, and in Fig. 14b, the case of failure. Comparing these images, we notice that Fig. 14b has heterogeneous texture, which is similar to what happens in many non-mass ROIs. We believe this was the source of the error in our methodology.

In Fig. 15
                         we show the cases of success and failure for the non-mass class. In Fig. 15a, the case of success and in Fig. 15b, the case of failure. We believe that the reason for the failure is that this mass has a texture very similar to many non-mass ROIs.

A comparison with other works in the area is a difficult task because none of the works cited in this paper provided the exams used. The only piece of information provided was the database used: DDSM or MIAS. So, we were unable to perform a rigorous evaluation of our method with respect to other works.

Our objective with Table 5
                         is to provide an overview (exam database, execution time, complexity of the methodology, etc.) of the results found in the related works and in our work. Thus, we intend to show that our methodology is promising compared to other works because we achieved results above 95% for various types of situations: (1) classification using only texture, (2) large and complex samples, and (3) several sample configurations for training and tests.

                         approach, as seen in Table 5, were improved in comparison to most of the previous works, except [19]. However, [19] used a considerably smaller sample than the one used in our work. In summary, the proposed methodology achieved an accuracy comparable to the best results found in the recent literature for the classification of mammogram tissues as masses and non-masses.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The proposed methodology was evaluated by applying a set of 3404 regions (mass and non-mass) from the DDSM database, which were divided into the following training and testing proportions: 20%/80%, 40%/60%, 50%/50%, 60%/40% e 80%/20%. The experimental results allowed the formulation of the following conclusions:

                                  combined with phylogenetic trees led to good results in terms of mass and non-mass classification. We believe that indexes of this nature deserve diversified studies and tests.

The use of regions extracted based on internal and external masking produced good individual results, but the best results for all trees were obtained when they were combined. In other words, with those approaches, we were able to individually analyze each region of the masses and non-masses with greater detail.

By using only texture for the characterization of mass and non-mass, combining the taxonomic indexes 
                                    Δ
                                  and 
                                    
                                       
                                          Δ
                                       
                                       
                                          ⁎
                                       
                                    
                                  with phylogenetic tree presented a good result, independent of the form analyzed.

The large number of individuals found does not compromise the methodology because the taxonomic indexes 
                                    Δ
                                  and 
                                    
                                       
                                          Δ
                                       
                                       
                                          ⁎
                                       
                                    
                                  are independent of the sample effort (i.e., number of individuals) [4].

Finally, it is important to highlight that the DDSM database is extremely complex and diversified, and it contains countless different cases of breast lesions. This database has exams that were extracted from various mammograms, making it more difficult to detect, classify or even diagnose breast cancer with CAD/CADx systems.

Collectively, all these points highlight the value of our methodology. The properties of texture analysis through the taxonomic indexes of diversity (
                           Δ
                        ) and distinction (

                        ) combined with phylogenetic trees showed a good response in the experiments. In addition, the complexity of the DDSM database allows us to come to a more precise conclusion from the results.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This work introduced a method that uses taxonomic diversity (
                        Δ
                     ) and distinctness (
                        
                           
                              Δ

                     ) indexes, and the support vector machine for the discrimination and classification of regions in mammograms as mass and non-mass.

The results demonstrate the promising performance of the texture extraction techniques by means of taxonomic indexes. The use of internal and external masks to delimit an area corresponding to a region of interest in the mammograms helped us take advantage of all of the information contained in the image. Another important factor that contributed to the good results was the creation of a phylogenetic tree. We noticed that the larger distance and a higher number of hierarchical levels correspond to higher diversity within a community. Thus, the use of this tree facilitated the discrimination between mass and non-mass.

While the results achieved by analyzing the phylogenetic trees and the taxonomic indexes are promising, it is necessary to increase the number and the variability of the mammogram samples to achieve a general and robust methodology.

Finally, the methodology presented herein can be integrated with CAD/CADx tools that can be applied to classify suspect regions as mass and non-mass for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
