                  This study investigates scheduling problems that occur when the weighted number of late jobs that are subject to deterministic machine availability constraints have to be minimized. These problems can be modeled as a more general job selection problem. Cases with resumable, non-resumable, and semi-resumable jobs as well as cases without availability constraints are investigated. The proposed efficient mixed integer linear programming approach includes possible improvements to the model, notably specialized lifted knapsack cover cuts. The method proves to be competitive compared with existing dedicated methods: numerical experiments on randomly generated instances show that all 350-job instances of the test bed are closed for the well-known problem

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Even though most scheduling problems assume that a job can be processed anytime after its release date, an increasing number of research papers investigate scheduling problems that are subject to machine or job availability constraints. In this context, machines or jobs may be unavailable for processing during given time intervals. Such constraints appear (Hashemian, Diallo, & Vizvàri, 2012; Kubiak, Blazewicz, Formanowicz, Breit, & Schmidt, 2002; Mellouli, Sadfi, Chu, & Kacem, 2009, 2013; Schmidt, 2000) in the cases of joint production and maintenance management (where preventive maintenance or periodic repair tasks limit the usage time of machines), operating systems for mono and multi-processors (where high priority tasks interfere with low priority programs) or when implementing rolling time horizon approaches (where decisions taken for a first time horizon are considered as fixed for the consecutive overlapping time horizon), etc.

The problems investigated in this paper are defined by a set

A job cannot be preempted by another one: if a job starts on the machine, no other job can start until the first one completes.

We investigate different job behaviors in terms of unavailability constraints. First, jobs are said to be non-resumable, according to the classification of Ma, Chu, and Zuo (2010): if a job has started but has not completed before an unavailability period, it must be restarted from zero after the unavailability period.

                      in standard three-field notation (Graham et al., 1979). Conversely, jobs may be resumable: a job may start before an unavailability period and be resumed thereafter. In this case, the completion of the job is simply postponed for the duration of the unavailability periods crossed by the job. This problem is denoted by

                     . A third type of problem allows jobs to be resumed after an unavailability period at the expense of an additional setup time. Two variations are possible for this feature, which we refer to as semi-resumable jobs: according to Lee (1999), interrupted jobs must be partially restarted after an unavailability period, occupying the machine for a time which is proportional to the duration of the job that has already been processed. In this paper, we address a variation of this feature for which the additional setup time is fixed and job-dependent, analogous to the work of Graves and Lee (1999). More precisely, the setup duration is equal to

                     . The hypothesis is motivated by the following: The industrial process does not require partial job reprocessing in many real-life situations, especially in the case of preventive and planned maintenance. Instead, the machine requires a setup operation, whose duration only depends on the job to be resumed. An example of this kind of requirement is encountered in the corrugated cardboard industry following the periodic cleaning operations of cutting devices. These setup times are implicitly included in job processing times when no maintenance activities are considered. Also, sometimes a setup operation following

Our paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains a brief literature review for related scheduling problems. Section 3 describes the general scheduling problem (STWP) of selecting and scheduling jobs that are subject to time windows and group constraints on parallel machines; three MILP models are proposed. Section 4 presents valid inequalities and bound tightening results to improve these models. In particular, we use one of the MILP formulations to derive lifted knapsack cover cuts, which are also valid for the other models. We propose two specialized lifting procedures, embedding a subset of the specific constraints of STWP to yield stronger cuts. Section 5 describes how problems

To our knowledge, the best known exact algorithms have been contributed by M’Hallah and Bulfin (2007) for the weighted case and by Kao, Sewell, Jacobson, and Hall (2012) for the unweighted case

Baptiste and Sadykov (2009) present a generic MILP model for total cost scheduling problems with piecewise linear objective functions. According to their numerical experiments, this very general model does not perform as well as existing dedicated approaches.

Concerning only the case of deterministic machine availability constraints (when unavailability periods are perfectly known in advance), (Ma et al., 2010) gathers more than 90 research papers. Interestingly, only one paper mentioning the minimization of the number of late jobs is referenced in this survey: (Lee, 1996) shows that

Zhong, Ou, and Wang (2014) studies the Order Acceptance and Scheduling problem with such constraints, which is an extension of the problem.

This section introduces a dominance property for optimal schedules of STWP. It is a generalization of a result proposed in Detienne, Dauzère-Pérès, and Yugma (2011), where the authors present MILP models to minimize a regular step cost function of job completion times on parallel machines. A similar principle was also used in Dauzère-Pérès and Sevaux (2002) to minimize the number of late jobs on a single machine. Their prior work and our current investigation are both based on the idea of inducing a strict order on the set of processed jobs to derive strong MILP models by greatly simplifying the expression of both conjunctive and disjunctive constraints. However, these two approaches lead to different dominant orders as well as different models resulting in different possible improvements.

The core idea can be seen as an extension of the earliest deadline first (EDF) rule (Jackson, 1955), which is dominant in the special case of jobs with equal release dates.

                         is processed, or else it is equal to 0. Constraints (2) ensure that exactly one job of each group is selected. Constraints (3) state that each job cannot start before its release date, whereas Constraints (4) express the resource and conjunctive constraints (each machine can handle at most one job at a time, and selected jobs are processed in the correct order). Constraints (5) force each job to complete before its deadline. Note that, because jobs are sorted according to a non-decreasing order of their deadlines, Constraint (5) at rank k does not over-constrain the completion times of jobs in the range

                        . Expression (1) is the objective function, which minimizes the sum of the costs of selected jobs. Note that Constraints (3)–(5) concern the feasibility of the selection of jobs from a resource point of view. Detienne et al. (2011) describe another ILP characterization of these constraints for their problem as a set of knapsack constraints, which are used in an iterative constraint generation procedure. The adaptation to STWP is straightforward and leads to a multiple-choice multidimensional knapsack problem formulation (MMKP) by replacing (3)–(5) with

The main drawback of formulation (A) is that Constraints (3) induce a poor linear relaxation when some jobs have large release dates. The (MMKP) formulation provides a better linear relaxation, but cannot be used directly due to its large number of constraints.

This section is devoted to a new model aimed at circumventing those drawbacks by keeping a relatively small size and providing a stronger linear relaxation. This MILP model is inspired by the work of Dauzère-Pérès and Sevaux (2002), in which the authors establish a related dominant order (represented by a so-called master sequence) for

                        . They propose a MILP model that also makes use of large constants, but, in practice, these constants are smaller than those involved in Constraints (3). Unfortunately, their model is based on the master sequence, assuming that selected jobs are sequenced according to a non-decreasing order of their release dates, which is the wrong assumption in our case.

We then arrive at the following key idea: Consider a single machine problem, suppose that a selection of jobs is fixed (and that the sequence of jobs is fixed accordingly), and focus on the timing sub-problem. This sub-problem consists in checking whether all selected jobs can be scheduled according to this sequence while satisfying their time windows. For this purpose, a simple strategy is to schedule selected jobs as soon as possible on each machine, and verify that all jobs complete before their deadline. We can now reverse the direction of time in the timing problem by considering that the time horizon ends at time 0 and starts at a sufficiently late time instant (e.g.

This section provides several potential improvements to the models presented in the previous section. An interesting feature of these MILP is that they share the set of variables x, which have the exact same meaning in all three of the models. Hence, any relation involving this set of variables can be used in any model. In the sequel, let us assume that, on each machine

The following two propositions exploit the classical selections on disjunction (see e.g. Carlier, 1982) to strengthen the model.

                               of time slots without changing the set of integer solutions, as soon as none of the quantities are negative. We can verify that

                               is chosen so that all dates are nonnegative and as small as possible. Second, according to Proposition 5,

Lifted knapsack cover inequalities have proved to be a powerful tool for solving (mixed) integer linear programs involving knapsack constraints (Balas, 1975; Crowder, Johnson, & Padberg, 1983). The concept was substantially improved by introducing lifted generalized upper bound cover inequalities (Gu, Nemhauser, & Savelsbergh, 1998) and sequence-independent lifting procedures (Gu, Nemhauser, & Savelsbergh, 2000; Louveaux & Wolsey, 2007; Wolsey, 1977).

This section presents valid inequalities that can be used to further strengthen our models. As already mentioned, any relation involving the set of variables x can be used in any of the three models presented in Section 3. Thus, we use the (MMKP) formulation to identify classical knapsack cover cuts. Then, different lifting procedures are designed to provide cuts that can also be used on Models (A) and (B). We rely on sequence-dependent lifting procedures, which are known to be less powerful than sequence-independent methods. However, this simple strategy allows us to design specialized lifting procedures for STWP by introducing specific constraints in the lifting sub-problems.

As described in Section 4.2.3, the lifting step consists in sequentially solving optimization problems. Classical lifting procedures for knapsack cover inequalities are based on a single knapsack constraint, and lifting one coefficient corresponds to solving one knapsack problem. The first specialized lifting procedure that we propose integrates constraints on time windows of the jobs and can be performed in polynomial time. The second procedure introduces group constraints and constraints from Proposition 4 in order to obtain stronger lifted coefficients. Both lifting problems can be considered scheduling problems.

The transformation proposed in this section is based on the idea that unavailability periods have two consequences for jobs: First, no job can start during one of them. Second, the completion of a job that crosses one or several unavailability periods is postponed for a deterministic, foreseeable amount of time. Let us introduce the following remarks.

                         allows us to implicitly account for the machine’s unavailability periods. Indeed, it ensures that, in any feasible solution, no job starts during an unavailability period (or there is exactly one such job, which is late and can be removed without changing the cost of the schedule). Moreover, the completion time of each job will be correctly postponed. The following dominance property reduces the set of possible starting times for each job.

                         removes the setup time and does not result in the job completing later. The following remark states that the duration for which the machine is occupied by each job is a stepwise function of the job’s starting time.

Note that the only events that can occur during an unavailability period are release or due dates, which can be shifted to the beginning of the corresponding period without consequences. Therefore, contracting the horizon during unavailability periods, i.e. considering that no time elapses during them, yields an equivalent problem.

                         aims to shift a time instant from a problem with unavailability periods to a problem without unavailability periods by removing the unavailability periods and considering that no time elapses during them. In its definition, the first case applies when t lies between two unavailability periods, whereas the second case concerns situations where t falls during an unavailability period.

It is computationally expensive to calculate the specialized lifted cover cuts (SLCC) described in Section 4.2. The procedure therefore uses several parameters that we fixed according to preliminary tests. In our experiments, (SLCC) are applied at root node only and through several passes. At each pass, only cuts based on an initial cover

Each time it encounters a dominated variable, it assigns it the first unused value, if there is one available, and sets this value as used. If no value is available, it assigns 0, which means that the corresponding constraint will not be taken into account for this valid inequality. When it encounters a dominating variable such that at least one of the linked dominated variables received a non-zero value, its opposite is assigned, and the value is reset as unused.

                        Table 1
                         reports results we obtained when solving different types of problems by applying the MILP solver to Model (B) through the transformation proposed in this paper and using all described improvements except SLCC. This approach proves to be very efficient in spite of its genericity, because all 250-job instances of

For the case of semi-resumable jobs, 55 300-job instances cannot be solved within one hour, which is five more times than for Model (B). This is explained by the large release dates generated for the jobs in (STWP) for this problem. Because of these preliminary results, we did not evaluate Model (A) for the whole test bed of

The average computing time for instances solved to optimality is 415.7seconds, compared with only 10.8seconds using our method. Let us recall that the work of Tanaka and Fujikuma (2012) applies to generic total cost single machine problems, which explains these modest results on our specific problem.

                         has been published in M’Hallah and Bulfin (2007), where the authors report success for instances with up to 200 jobs. Although their algorithm is likely to perform better with the computer power available today, it is based on a MILP formulation that cannot handle machine availability constraints. Because our method is theoretically suitable for multiple machine problems, we applied it to solving the multi-machine assignment and scheduling problem (Sadykov & Wolsey, 2006). The test bed proposed by the authors is composed of 36 instances counting up to 54 jobs to be assigned to nine machines, and their method, based on constraint programming and integer programming cooperation, solves all of them in less than one hour. The use of Model (B) is not as efficient, given that only 15 instances are solved on our faster computer. By using (SLCC), only 4 more instances can be solved. These degraded results suggest that our model is good at sequencing jobs once they are assigned to machines, but it is not very adapted to the assignment component of the problem.

In order to evaluate the pertinence of the specialized lifting cover cuts, we apply the procedures to solving the hardest instances of our test bed. We select instances which cannot be solved within 1000seconds (corresponding to the column ”#unsolved 1000seconds” in Table 1) using Model (B) alone to test

This paper shows that the generic problem STWP can serve to model several scheduling problems, and assist in solving these problems efficiently through the use of a MILP approach. Indeed, the performance of the developed method matches that of dedicated methods for the most well-known problem investigated in this study. Furthermore, the method can be directly adapted to parallel machine problems and cases where different unavailability periods are defined for each job. There is still room for improvement: although it seems to us that integrating dominance properties into the lifting problem is of theoretical interest, it does not appear to be of great help in practice. This might be caused by the naive assignment of the constraint identifiers employed in our study, which could be refined. Additionally, it might be possible to improve the theoretical and practical time-complexity of the lifting procedures. Considerable progress might be achieved by investigating the possibility of sequence-independent lifting procedures that integrate specific STWP constraints. In addition, it is likely that our methods cannot solve some instances, not because the size of the MILP model is too large or because of a poor linear relaxation, but because of the existence of a large number of symmetrical solutions generated by similar machines in the constructed STWP problem. Thus, another means of improvement lies in the development of symmetry breaking techniques for this problem. We hope that it will be possible to extend this work to solve other scheduling problems by embedding more realistic constraints, such as sequence-dependent setup times, precedence constraints, batching features and the like.
