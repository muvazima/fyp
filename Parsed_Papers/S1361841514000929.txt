                  We first propose a large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping algorithm to align multiple b-value diffusion weighted imaging (mDWI) data, specifically acquired via hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI). We denote this algorithm as LDDMM-HYDI. We then propose a Bayesian probabilistic model for estimating the white matter atlas from HYDIs. We adopt the work given in Hosseinbor et al. (2013) and represent the q-space diffusion signal with the Bessel Fourier orientation reconstruction (BFOR) signal basis. The BFOR framework provides the representation of mDWI in the q-space and the analytic form of the emsemble average propagator (EAP) reconstruction, as well as reduces memory requirement. In addition, since the BFOR signal basis is orthonormal, the

Using real HYDI datasets, we show that the Bayesian model generates the white matter atlas with anatomical details. Moreover, we show that it is important to consider the variation of mDWI reorientation due to a small change in diffeomorphic transformation in the LDDMM-HYDI optimization and to incorporate the full information of HYDI for aligning mDWI. Finally, we show that the LDDMM-HYDI outperforms the LDDMM algorithm with diffusion tensors generated from each shell of HYDI.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Diffusion-weighted MRI methods are promising tools for characterizing tissue microstructure. While diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) methods are widely used methods, they do not provide a complete description of the diffusion distribution. In order to more accurately reconstruct the ensemble average propagator (EAP), a thorough the sampling of the q-space is needed, which requires multiple b-value diffusion weighted imaging (mDWI). The EAP estimation using mDWI better characterizes more complex neural fiber geometries and non-Gaussian diffusion behavior when compared to single b-value techniques (Wu and Alexander, 2007). Recently, new q-space imaging techniques, diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) (Wedeen et al., 2005) and hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI) (Wu and Alexander, 2007) have been developed for estimating the EAP. HYDI is a mDWI technique that samples the diffusion signal along concentric spherical shells in the q-space. The number of encoding directions increases with each shell to increase the angular resolution with the level of diffusion weighting. Originally, HYDI employed the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reconstruct the EAP. However, the recent advent of analytical EAP reconstruction schemes, which obtain closed-form expressions of the EAP, obviate the use of the FFT in HYDI. Such reconstruction schemes include diffusion propagator imaging (DPI) (Descoteaux et al., 2011), simple harmonic oscillator based reconstruction and estimation (SHORE) (Ozarslan et al., 2008), spherical polar Fourier imaging (SPFI) (Cheng et al., 2010; Assemlal et al., 2009). One recent technique successfully validated on HYDI datasets is Bessel Fourier orientation reconstruction (BFOR) (Hosseinbor et al., 2013). While mDWI techniques like HYDI have not been widely used, the new human connectome project (Essen et al., 2013) and spin-off projects will likely significantly increase the application. However, there is a lack of fundamental image analysis tools for mDWI and EAP maps, such as registration and atlas generation, that can fully utilize their information.

In the last decades, researchers have spent great efforts on developing registration algorithms to align diffusion tensors derived from DTI and orientation distribution functions (ODFs) derived from HARDI (e.g., Alexander et al. (2001), Raffelt et al. (2011), Du et al. (2012)). However, registration algorithms directly based on DWIs are few. The direct alignment of DWIs in the q-space utilizes the full diffusion information, is independent of the choice of diffusion models and their reconstruction algorithms (e.g., tensor), and unifies the transformation to align the local diffusion profiles defined at each voxel of two brains (Dhollander et al., 2010; Yap and Shen, 2012; Zhang et al., 2012). Dhollander et al. (2010) developed an algorithm that transforms the diffusion signals on a single shell of the q-space and preserves anisotropic as well as isotropic volume fractions. Yap and Shen (2012) proposed to decompose the diffusion signals on a single shell of the q-space into a series of weighted diffusion basis functions, reorient these functions independently based on a local affine transformation, and then recompose the reoriented functions to obtain the final transformed diffusion signals. This approach provides the representation of the diffusion signals and also explicitly models the isotropic component of the diffusion signals to avoid undesirable artifacts during the local affine transformation. Zhang et al. (2012) developed a diffeomorphic registration algorithm for aligning diffusion signals on a single shell of the q-space.

Only recently, Dhollander et al. (2011) aligned DWIs on multiple shells of the q-space by first estimating transformation using a multi-channel diffeomorphic mapping algorithm, in which generalized fractional anisotrophy (GFA) images computed from each shell were used as mapping objects, and then applying the transformation to DWIs on each shell using the DWI reorientation method given in Dhollander et al. (2010). This approach neglected possible influences of the DWI reorientation on the optimization of the spatial transformation. Hsu et al. (2012) generalized the large deformation diffeomorphic metric image mapping algorithm (Beg et al., 2005) to DWIs on multiple shells of the q-space and considered the image domain and the q-space as the domain where the diffeomorphic transformation is applied to. The authors claimed that the reorientation of DWIs is no longer needed because the transformation also incorporates the deformation due to the shape differences in the diffusion profiles in the q-space. It is a robust registration approach with the explicit consideration of the large deformation in both the image domain and q-space. However, its computational complexity and memory requirement are high.

While limited research has been done for aligning the HYDI images, efforts on the white matter atlas from HYDI is even less. Only recently, Dhollander et al. (2011) employed their multi-channel diffeomorphic matching algorithm to generate the atlas from multiple HYDI datasets. To our best knowledge, there is no probabilistic atlas generation approach for HYDI.

In this paper, we propose a large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) algorithm to align HYDI datasets, denoted as LDDMM-HYDI, and then develop a Bayesian probabilistic estimation framework for generating the HYDI atlas. In particular, we adopt the Bessel Fourier orientation reconstruction (BFOR) framework in representing the q-space signal (Hosseinbor et al., 2013). Unlike the diffeomorphic mapping of mDWIs in Hsu et al. (2012), the BFOR signal basis provides the representation of the q-space signal and the analytic form of the EAP reconstruction, as well as reduces memory requirement. In addition, since the BFOR signal basis is orthonormal, the

                      norm that quantifies the differences in the q-space signals can be easily computed as the sum of the squared differences in the BFOR expansion coefficients. In this work, we will show that the reorientation of the q-space signal due to spatial transformation can be easily defined on the BFOR signal basis. Unlike the work in Dhollander et al. (2011), we will incorporate the BFOR signal basis into the LDDMM framework and derive the gradient descent algorithm for solving the LDDMM-HYDI variational problem with explicit orientation optimization. Even though the LDDMM-HYDI algorithm is largely based on our previous work (Du et al., 2013), in this paper we further develop a Bayesian probabilistic model to estimate the brain white matter atlas from the q-space. This probabilistic model is the extension of the previous Bayesian atlas estimation for scalar-based intensity images (Ma et al., 2008). With the aids of the BFOR representation and reorientation of mDWIs introduced in this work, we show that it is feasible to adopt the previous Bayesian atlas estimation model for scalar-valued images (Ma et al., 2008) to HYDI. Nevertheless, the HYDI data has much higher dimensionality than the scalar image used in Ma et al. (2008). Moreover, the HYDI alignment requires the reorientation of the diffusion signals, while the scalar image alignment does not. Hence, we show that the extension of the Bayesian scalar image atlas generation in (Ma et al., 2008) to the HYDI data is not straightforward. In this paper, we thus reformulate the Bayesian atlas generation model for HYDI under the LDDMM framework and derive the expectation–maximization algorithm to optimize the HYDI atlas based on a set of HYDI data. As shown below, the main contributions of this paper are:

                           to seek large deformation for aligning HYDI datasets based on the BFOR representation of mDWI.

to derive the rotation-based reorientation of the q-space signal via the BFOR signal basis. This is equivalent to applying Wigner matrix to the BFOR expansion coefficients, where Wigner matrix can be easily constructed by the rotation matrix (see Section 3.1).

to derive the gradient descent algorithm for the LDDMM-HYDI variational problem with the explicit orientation optimization. In particular, we provide a computationally efficient method for calculating the variation of Wigner matrix due to the small variation of the diffeomorphic transformation (see Section 3.4).

to show that the LDDMM-HYDI gradient descent algorithm does not involve the calculation of the BFOR signal bases and hence avoids the discretization in the q-space.

to propose a Bayesian estimation model for the q-space signals represented via the BFOR signal basis and derive an expectation–maximization algorithm for solving it (see Section 4).

to validate the mapping accuracy of the LDDMM-HYDI algorithm and compare our approach with the LDDMM algorithm incorporating multiple diffusion tensors derived from each shell of the q-space. This has not been shown in our previous work (Du et al., 2013).

In this paper, we employ the BFOR signal basis to represent the q-space diffusion signal according to the work in Hosseinbor et al. (2013). The diffusion signal is assumed to satisfy Laplace’s equation. The BFOR basis is derived based on the heat equation, a generalization of Laplace’s equation and hence naturally incorporates water diffusion processes. In addition, the BFOR signal basis is orthonormal, which leads to the simple computation on the norm of the diffusion signals as shown below. Furthermore, the BFOR signal basis gives the analytic solution for the EAP as shown in Hosseinbor et al. (2013), which facilitates the registration of the EAP data via aligning the BFOR coefficients defined in the q-space. In the BFOR framework, the q-space diffusion signal,

However, its angular profile in each shell of the q-space is transformed according to the rotation transformation. Hence, we define

                        , we now state a variational problem for mapping HYDIs from one subject to another. We define this problem in the “large deformation” setting of Grenander’s group action approach for modeling the white matter anatomy, that is, the HYDI data are modeled by assuming that they can be generated from one to another via flows of diffeomorphisms,

                         in the continuous setting. In this section, we elaborate the numerical implementation of our algorithm under the discrete setting. Since HYDI DW signals were represented using the orthonormal BFOR signal bases, both the computation of J in Eq. (7) and the gradient computation in Eq. (17) do not explicitly involve the calculation 
                           
                              Ψ

                        . Hence, we do not need to discretize the q-space. In the discretization of the image domain, we first represent the ambient space,

In this section, we show the atlas generated using Algorithm 1, evaluate the LDDMM-HYDI mapping accuracy, and compare it with that of the diffeomorphic mapping for multiple diffusion tensors where the tensors are generated from each shell of the q-space. This diffeomorphic mapping algorithm for multiple diffusion tensors were adopted from the one in Cao et al. (2005). The experiments were performed on 36 human brain datasets (age:

                     ). The datasets were acquired using a hybrid, non-Cartesian sampling scheme (Wu and Alexander, 2007). The HYDI encoding scheme is described in Table 1
                     . Since the EAP reconstruction is sensitive to the angular resolution, the number of directions in the outer shells was increased to better characterize complex tissue organization (see Table 1). In the experiments of the atlas generation and LDDMM-HYDI evaluation, we represented HYDI DW signals using the BFOR signal basis with up to the fourth order modified SH bases and up to the sixth order spherical Bessel functions. The corresponding BFOR expansion coefficients were used in the atlas generation and LDDMM-HYDI optimization.

In the experiment of the atlas generation, we first chose one HYDI dataset as hyperatlas and assumed

                         such that the hyperatlas was used as the initial atlas. We then followed Algorithm 1 and repeated it for ten iterations. Notice that

First, we experimentally demonstrate the convergence of the diffeomorphic metric between individual subjects and the estimated atlas. This is measured using the square root of the inner product of the initial momentum. Fig. 1
                         shows the mean diffeomorphic metric of individual subjects referenced to the estimated atlas as well as its standard deviation across the subjects. From Fig. 1, we observe that the average diffeomorphic metric changed less than

                         demostrates the atlas zero-displacement probability (Po) (Assaf et al., 2000), mean squared displacement (MSD) (Wu and Alexander, 2007), and generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) under three different radii (Tuch, 2004). These figures visually illustrate that the estimated atlas has the anatomical details of the brain white matter, particularly in the region near the cortex.

Finally, we study the effects of the hyperatlas choice on the estimated atlas. In the Bayesian modeling for the HYDI atlas generation presented here, the hyperatlas is assumed to be known and fixed. In addition, the hyperatlas is used as the initialization for the atlas in the EM algorithm. Therefore, there is possibility that the anatomy of the estimated atlas could be influenced by the choice of the hyperatlas. We now demonstrate this influence on the estimated atlas due to the hyperatlas.

We repeated the atlas estimation procedure when two different HYDI subjects, shown in Fig. 5
                        (a and b), were respectively selected as the hyperatlas. Fig. 5(d and e) shows the estimated HYDI atlases obtained from the hyperatlases shown in Fig. 5(a and b), respectively. To evaluate the similarity between the two hyperatlases and estimated atlases, we first computed the diffusion probability density functions (PDFs) of water molecules, i.e., the ensemble average propagator (EAP), using Fourier transform (Hosseinbor et al., 2013) and then calculated the symmetrized Kullback–Leibler (sKL) divergence between the PDFs (Chiang et al., 2008) at individual voxels. As seen in Fig. 5(c), the sKL divergence is large between the PDFs of the two hyperatlases even in the corpus callusom and external capsule. Nevertheless, Fig. 5(f) shows the sKL divergence between the PDFs of the two estimated atlases and illustrates a reduction in the sKL divergence compared to that in Fig. 5(c). A two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test reveals that the cumulative distribution of the sKL divergence as shown in Fig. 6
                         between the two estimated atlases (Fig. 5(d and e)) is significantly greater than that between the two hyperatlases (Fig. 5(a and b)) (
                           
                              p
                              <
                              0.001
                           
                        ), which indicates that more voxels with small sKL divergence between the two estimated atlases when compared to those between the two hyperatlases. This result suggests the improved similarity between the two estimated atlases when compared to that between the two hyperatlases.

Given the altas generated in Section 5.1, we mapped the 36 subjects into the atlas space using LDDMM-HYDI with 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    σ
                                 
                                 
                                    V
                                 
                              
                              =
                              10
                           
                        . To evaluate the mapping results, we first illustrate the mapping results of HYDI datasets using LDDMM-HYDI and then evaluate the influence of the reorientation on the optimization of the diffeomorphic transformation. Finally, we compare the mapping accuracy of LDDMM-HYDI with that of an existing diffeomorphic registration method for DTI (Cao et al., 2005) that was adapted to multiple tensors generated from each shell of the q-space.


                        Fig. 7
                         shows the LDDMM-HYDI mapping results of three subjects. The last five columns respectively illustrate the geometric shapes of the diffusion signals at five shells of the q-space in the brain regions with crossing fibers. Red, blue, and green contours respectively represent the shape of the diffusion signals from the atlas, subject, and deformed subjects. Visually, the diffusion profiles at each shell can be matched well after the mapping.

We next evaluated the mapping accuracy of the LDDMM-HYDI algorithms with and without the computation of Term (B) in Eq. (11) during the optimization, where Term (B) seeks the diffeomorphic transformation such that the local diffusion profiles of the atlas and subject’s HYDIs can be aligned. We demonstrate the importance of Term (B) in the optimization of the HYDI registration even though it is often neglected in existing DWI-based registration algorithms (e.g., Dhollander et al., 2010, 2011). For this, we first computed the diffusion probability density functions (PDFs) of water molecules, i.e., the ensemble average propagator (EAP), using Fourier transform Hosseinbor et al. (2013). Then, we calculated the symmetrized Kullback–Leibler (sKL) divergence between the deformed subject and atlas PDFs Chiang et al. (2008) in major white matter tracts. The smaller sKL metric indicates the better alignment between the deformed subject and atlas HYDIs. The major white matter tracts evaluated in this study include corpus callosum (CC), corticospinal tract (CST), internal capsule (IC), corona radiata (CR), external capsule (EC), cingulum (CG), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO). Table 2
                         lists the values of the mean and standard deviation of the sKL metric for each major white matter tract among 36 subjects when the LDDMM-HYDI algorithms with and without the Term (B) computation were respectively employed. Pairwise Student t-tests suggest that the LDDMM-HYDI algorithm with the explicit orientation optimization (Term (B) computation) significantly improves the alignment in the major white matter tracts when compared to that without the explicit orientation optimization (Studnet’s t-tests: 
                           
                              p
                              <
                              0.05
                           
                         for all tracts).

Last, we compared the mapping accuracy of LDDMM-HYDI with that of an existing diffeomorphic registration method for DTI (Cao et al., 2005) that was adapted to multiple tensors generated from each shell of the q-space. The LDDMM multi-tensor mapping is superior to the existing approach that aligns DWIs on multiple shells of the q-space based on the generalized fractional anisotrophy (GFA) images computed from each shell (Dhollander et al., 2011). In this experiment, we first computed three diffusion tensors derived from the diffusion weighted images at b
                        =1200, 2700, and 4800s/mm2. We then employed the LDDMM multi-tensor mapping algorithm to simultaneously align the three tensor images of a subject to those of the atlas. This multi-tensor mapping algorithm (LDDMM multi-tensor) was implemented under the same LDDMM framework as one for the LDDMM-HYDI mapping algorithm presented in this paper. Hence, we chose the same parameter, 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    σ
                                 
                                 
                                    V
                                 
                              
                              =
                              5
                           
                        , to control the smoothness of the deformation. The transformation obtained from this multi-tensor diffeomorphic mapping was finally applied to the DWI signals based on reorientation scheme given in Eq. (6). Table 3
                         lists the squared difference in the diffusion signals between the atlas and deformed subjects after the LDDMM multi-tensor and LDDMM-HYDI mapping. Pairwise Student t-tests suggested the significant improvement in the alignment of DWIs using LDDMM-HYDI against LDDMM multi-tensor (
                           
                              p
                              <
                              0.05
                           
                        ) at every shell of the q-space. Furthermore, we computed the sKL divergence between the PDFs of the atlas and the subjects deformed using the LDDMM multi-tensor and LDDMM-HYDI mapping for major white matter tracts. Table 4
                         lists the values of the mean and standard deviation of the sKL metric for each major white matter tract among 36 subjects when the LDDMM multi-tensor and LDDMM-HYDI algorithms were respectively employed. Pairwise Student t-tests suggest that the LDDMM-HYDI algorithm significantly improves the alignment in the major white matter tracts when compared to that obtained using LDDMM multi-tensor mapping (Studnet’s t-tests: 
                           
                              p
                              <
                              0.05
                           
                         for all tracts).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In conclusion, we proposed the LDDMM-HYDI variational problem and the Bayesian atlas estimation model based on the BFOR signal basis representation of DWIs. We derived the gradient of this variational problem with the explicit computation of the mDWI reorientation and provided a numeric algorithm without a need of the discretization in the q-space. Comparing with our existing work (Du et al., 2013), we further derived the EM algorithm for the estimation of the atlas in the Bayesian framework. Moreover, we provided the extensive evaluation on the mapping accuracy based on a new dataset of 36 healthy adults and compared LDDMM-HYDI with that of the diffeomorphic mapping based on diffusion tensors. Our results showed that (1) the atlas generated contains anatomical details of the white matter anatomy; (2) the explicit orientation optimization is necessary as it improves the alignment of the diffusion profiles of HYDI datasets; and (3) the comparison with the multi-tensor based diffeomorphic metric mapping suggests the importance for incorporating the full information of HYDI for the mDWI registration.

In this paper, our study was not able to examine the mapping accuracy using HARDI mapping approaches (e.g., Du et al. (2012), Raffelt et al. (2012)) as the imaging acquisition in each shell in our study is not sufficient to reconstruct the HARDI model. Moreover, we did not compare the performance of the LDDMM-HYDI mapping with that of the existing HYDI mapping approach (Dhollander et al., 2011). First of all, the influence of the reorientation on the optimization of the diffeomorphic transformation is shown to be crucial. The mapping algorithm in Dhollander et al. (2011) takes GFA images obtained from each shell of the q-space and estimates the deformation using a multi-channel diffeomorphic image mapping algorithm without the explicit computation of the reorientation during the optimization of the mapping algorithm. Second, we examined the mapping using multiple tensors generated from each shell in the q-space, which is superior than that using GFA images obtained from each shell in the q-space as given in Dhollander et al. (2011). Hence, we expect that the conclusion that LDDMM-HYDI outperforms LDDMM multi-tensor can be generalized to the existing HYDI mapping approach (Dhollander et al., 2011).
