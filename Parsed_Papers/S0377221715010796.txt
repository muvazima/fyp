                  Committees with yes-no-decisions are commonly modeled as simple games and the ability of a member to influence the group decision is measured by so-called power indices. For a weighted game we say that a power index satisfies local monotonicity if a player who controls a large share of the total weight vote does not have less power than a player with a smaller voting weight.
                  In (Holler, 1982) Manfred Holler introduced the Public Good index. In its unnormalized version, i.e., the raw measure, it counts the number of times that a player belongs to a minimal winning coalition. Unlike the Banzhaf index, it does not count the remaining winning coalitions in which the player is crucial. Holler noticed that his index does not satisfy local monotonicity, a fact that can be seen either as a major drawback (Felsenthal & Machover, 1998, 221 ff.)or as an advantage (Holler & Napel 2004).
                  In this paper we consider a convex combination of the two indices and require the validity of local monotonicity. We prove that the cost of obtaining it is high, i.e., the achievable new indices satisfying local monotonicity are closer to the Banzhaf index than to the Public Good index. All these achievable new indices are more solidary than the Banzhaf index, which makes them as very suitable candidates to divide a public good.
                  As a generalization we consider convex combinations of either: the Shift index, the Public Good index, and the Banzhaf index, or alternatively: the Shift Deegan–Packel, Deegan–Packel, and Johnston indices.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Consider a set of players who jointly make decisions under a given set of rules. Here we specialize to simple games and subclasses thereof. Power indices address the question of how much power collective decision rules, like a weighted (voting) rule, award to each individual player: is player i more or less powerful than player j, and by how much? For an example of an applied voting power analysis in the EU, we refer the interested reader to e.g. Algaba, Bilbao, and Fernández (2007); Bilbao, Fernández, Jiménez, and López (2002); Widgrén (1994). Different power indices measure different aspects of power and there is still a lot of research in order to answer the question which index to choose, see, e.g., Holler and Nurmi (2013). For a recent overview of different power indices see, e.g., Bertini, Freixas, Gambarelli, and Stach (2013). Many of these indices are based on decisiveness. A player is called critical in a coalition if his/her deletion in the coalition changes its status from winning to losing, so that the individual is decisive or crucial for it. All power indices, the classical and the newly introduced ones, considered in this paper are indeed based on counting different types of decisiveness for players in coalitions.

Some particular decision rules arise from so-called weighted games. Here each player 
                        
                           i
                           ∈
                           {
                           1
                           ,
                           ⋯
                           ,
                           n
                           }
                        
                      has a specific voting weight wi
                      and a collective decision requires enough supporters such that their total weight equals or surpasses a decision quota q. Let pi
                      be the power value assigned to player i by a power index. The power index is called locally monotonic if, for each pair of players i and j, wi
                      ≥ wj
                      implies pi
                      ≥ pj
                     , i.e., a player i who controls a large share of vote does not have less power than a player j with smaller voting weight. Local monotonicity is considered as an essential requirement for power measures by many authors. Felsenthal and Machover (1998, 221 ff.), for instance, argue that any a priori measure of power that violates local monotonicity, LM for brevity, is ‘pathological’ and should be disqualified as serving as a valid yardstick for measuring power. On the other hand, e.g. in Holler and Napel (2004), it is argued that local non-monotonicity is a very valuable property of a power index, since it can reveal certain properties of the underlying decision rule that are overlooked otherwise.

Local monotonicity is an implication of the dominance postulate which is based on the desirability relation as proposed by Isbell (1958). This property formalizes that a player i is at least as desirable as a player j if for any coalition S, such that j is not in S and the union of S and {j} is a winning coalition, i.e., is able to pass the collective decision at hand, the union of S and {i} is also a winning coalition. A power index satisfies dominance if pi
                      ≥ pj
                      whenever i dominates j, i.e., when player i is at least as desirable as player j.


                     Freixas and Gambarelli (1997) use desirability to define reasonable power measures and note that the dominance postulate implies local monotonicity. In this paper we will consider the Public Good, the Banzhaf, the Shift, the Shift Deegan–Packel, the Deegan–Packel, the Johnston index and convex combinations thereof. Since the Deegan–Packel index (Deegan & Packel, 1978), and the Public Good index (see Holler, 1982; Holler and Packel, 1983) violate local monotonicity, they also violate the dominance postulate. Moreover, any violation of local monotonicity for the Deegan–Packel index implies a violation of the Shift Deegan–Packel index (see Alonso-Meijide, Freixas, & Molinero, 2012) and any violation of the local monotonicity for the Public Good index implies a violation of the Shift index (see Alonso-Meijide & Freixas, 2010). It is well-known that the Banzhaf (1965) and Johnston (1978) indices satisfy the dominance postulate and therefore local monotonicity. If one or several power indices violate LM then a convex combination with another power index, that does not violate LM, yields a power index that also does not violate LM as long as the weight of the latter index is large enough. To study how large this has to be is the purpose of this paper.

Some works are devoted to verify the properties of dominance or local monotonicity (among others) for some power indices and to show their absence for some other power indices (see among others, Felsenthal and Machover (1995) or Freixas, Marciniak, and Pons (2012)). Other works are devoted to study subclasses of games for which a given power index not fulfilling local monotonicity satisfies it for such a subclass of games (see for instance, Holler, Ono, and Steffen (2001) and Holler and Napel (2004) for the Public Good index). Here we will also make a new contribution of this type, i.e., we consider two new subclasses of games for which the Public Good index satisfies local monotonicity.

Proportionality of power and weights can be seen as a generalization of local monotonicity, i.e., proportionality implies local monotonicity. For the classical power indices this property is satisfied for a subset of weighted games only. Power indices which generally satisfy this property are constructed in Kaniovski and Kurz (2015).

In this paper we modify the Public Good index with the purpose to achieve a set of new power indices being local monotonic and more solidary than the Banzhaf index. These two properties make those achievable power indices (if they exist) well-situated as yardstick for doing a fair division of a public good. The idea of such modification is nothing else than an hybrid between the original Public Good index and the Banzhaf index. It will turn out that the cost of obtaining local monotonicity is rather high, i.e., the achievable new indices satisfying local monotonicity are closer to the Banzhaf index than to the Public Good index. However, these indices stress more in minimal winning coalitions, as the Public Good index does, than in the rest of crucial winning coalitions, with goes in the direction of Riker’s size principle (Riker, 1962). The final result allows to find new indices being locally monotonic and being more solidary than the Banzhaf index, which makes them as good alternatives for the fair division of a public good among participants in the voting procedure.

The idea developed previously naturally extends when the raw Shift index is incorporated to the duo formed by the raw Public Good and raw Banzhaf indices. Local monotonic indices which are convex combinations of the three given raw indices are a further target of our research.

As an extension we do a similar study for convex combinations of the raw Johnston index, the raw Deegan–Packel index, and the raw Shift Deegan–Packel index.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the basic notation of games and power indices. Two subclasses of weighted games satisfying local monotonicity are presented in Section 3. The concept of considering convex combinations of some power indices as a new power index is outlined in Section 4. The cost of local monotonicity is introduced in the same section. Additionally we prove some structural results. An integer linear programming approach to compute the cost of local monotonicity is presented in Section 5. With the aid of the underlying algorithm we are able to state some exact values and lower bounds for the cost of local monotonicity in Section 6. The set of all convex multipliers leading to a locally monotonic power index is the topic of Section 7. We end with a conclusion in Section 8.

In the following we will denote the set of players, which jointly make a decision, by N and assume w.l.o.g. that the players are numbered from 1 to n, i.e., 
                        
                           N
                           =
                           {
                           1
                           ,
                           ⋯
                           ,
                           n
                           }
                        
                     . Here we restrict ourselves to binary decisions, i.e., each player can either vote 1, meaning ‘yes’, or 0, meaning ‘no’, on a certain issue. For the readers convenience we collect all necessary definitions briefly at this place. For a more extensive introduction we refer to Felsenthal and Machover (1998), Taylor and Zwicker (1999).

We call a subset S⊆N, collecting the ‘yes’-voters, coalition. A (binary) decision rule is formalized as a mapping v: 2
                        N
                      → {0, 1} from the set of possible coalitions to the set of possible aggregated decisions. It is quite natural to require that the aggregated decision transfers the players decision if they all coincide and that an enlarged set of supporters should not turn the decision from ‘yes’ to ‘no’:

                        Definition 1
                        A simple game is a mapping v: 2
                              N
                            → {0, 1} such that 
                              
                                 v
                                 (
                                 ∅
                                 )
                                 =
                                 0
                                 ,
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 v
                                 (
                                 N
                                 )
                                 =
                                 1
                                 ,
                              
                            and v(S) ≤ v(T) for all S ⊆ T ⊆ N.

Having local monotonicity in mind we additionally require that the players are linearly ordered according to their capabilities to influence the final group decision. This can be formalized, as already indicated in the introduction, with the desirability relation introduced in Isbell (1958). Intuitively, the dominance (or desirability) relation is an attempt to formalize the intuitive notion that underlies under the expression:‘i has at least as power than j’, while the equivalence between i and j formalizes the expression ‘i and j have the same power’.

                        Definition 2
                        We write i ⊐ j (or j ⊏ i) for two players i, j ∈ N of a simple game v if we have 
                              
                                 v
                                 
                                    (
                                    {
                                    i
                                    }
                                    ∪
                                    S
                                    ∖
                                    {
                                    j
                                    }
                                    )
                                 
                                 ≥
                                 v
                                 
                                    (
                                    S
                                    )
                                 
                              
                            for all {j} ⊆ S ⊆ N\{i} and we abbreviate i ⊐ j, j ⊐ i by i □ j.

In words we say that i dominates j for i⊐j and we say that i and j are equivalent for i□j.

                        Definition 3
                        A simple game v is called complete if the binary relation ⊐ is a total preorder, i.e.,

                              
                                 (1)
                                 
                                    i⊐i for all i ∈ N,


                                    i⊐j or j⊐i for all i, j ∈ N, and


                                    i⊐j, j⊐h implies i⊐h for all i, j, h ∈ N.

We call a coalition S of a simple game v winning if 
                        
                           v
                           (
                           S
                           )
                           =
                           1
                        
                      and losing otherwise. Each simple game is uniquely characterized by its set 
                        W
                      of winning coalitions (or its set 
                        L
                      of losing coalitions). A winning coalition S such that each of its proper subsets is losing is called a minimal winning coalition. The set 
                        M
                      of minimal winning coalitions is already sufficient to uniquely characterize a simple game. For complete games the defining set of winning coalitions can be further reduced. A minimal winning coalition S is called shift-minimal if for each pair of players i, j with i ∈ S, j ∉ S, i⊐j, 
                        
                           j
                           ¬
                           ⊐
                           i
                        
                      we have 
                        
                           v
                           (
                           S
                           ∖
                           {
                           i
                           }
                           ∪
                           {
                           j
                           }
                           )
                           =
                           0
                           ,
                        
                      i.e., replacing a player by a (properly) dominated player turns the coalition into a losing one. With this, each complete game is uniquely characterized by its set 
                        S
                      of shift-minimal winning coalitions.

A very transparent form of dominance is induced by weights.

                        Definition 4
                        A simple game v is called weighted (weighted game for brevity) if and only if there exist weights

                            but the sum of them leads to another incompatible inequality. Note, moreover, that in this game the 12 minimal winning coalitions of type {a, c, d} are shift-minimal winning, while the 4 minimal winning coalitions of type {1, 2, c} are not.

Given such a weighted representation we write 
                        
                           v
                           =
                           [
                           q
                           ;
                           
                              w
                              1
                           
                           ,
                           ⋯
                           ,
                           
                              w
                              n
                           
                           ]
                        
                     . All weighted games are complete. As remarked before wi
                      ≥ wj
                      implies that player i dominates player j, i.e., i⊐j, while i□j is still possible even for wi
                      > wj
                     . That is, having more weight does not necessarily imply having more influence in the game. i□j implies that the roles of the two players in the game are symmetrical. A standard example in which all players are equivalent but have different weight is the weighted game with weighted representation [51; 49, 48, 3]. However, it is well-known that if i□j but wi
                      > wj
                      in a game, then there is an equivalent weighted representation for the game that respects the equivalence relation.

In order to measure the influence of the players we use the concept of a power index, which we in general consider as a mapping from a set 
                        G
                      of games to a vector of n real numbers, where n is the number of players of the specific game. In most applications, considering subsets of the set of simple games, the image is a vector of n non-negative real numbers upper bounded by 1. To this end we denote by 
                        S
                      the set of simple games, by 
                        C
                      the set of complete games, and by 
                        W
                      the set of weighted games. In order to stress the underlying class of games, we speak of a power index P on
                     
                        G
                     , whenever it is not clear from the context.

In some contexts it is appropriate to further restrict the class of games:

                        Definition 5
                        A simple game is called proper if the complement N\S of any winning coalition S is losing. It is called strong if the complement N\S of any losing coalition S is winning. A simple game that is both proper and strong is called constant-sum (or self-dual).

Restricting the dominance property from the class of complete games to weighted games, we speak of local monotonicity.

We remark that the dominance property for the subclass of weighted games implies local monotonicity and local monotonicity implies symmetry, i.e., we have 
                        
                           
                              p
                              i
                           
                           =
                           
                              p
                              j
                           
                        
                      for all i□j. Further properties of classical power indices were named and studied in the literature and are here grouped together in the next definition. Recall first that a player i is null in a simple game, if the player does not belong to any minimal winning coalition. Removing a null player from a simple game (complete game or weighted game) v results in a simple game (complete game or weighted game) v′ – more formally v′ ≔ 2

In order to state the definition for the set of power indices mentioned in the introduction we call a winning coalition S critical for player i ∈ S if S\{i} is losing. Given a simple game v, by 
                        
                           D
                           i
                        
                      we denote the set of coalitions {i}⊆S⊆N being critical for player i. Similarly, we denote by 
                        
                           M
                           i
                        
                      the set of minimal winning coalitions containing player i and by 
                        
                           S
                           i
                        
                      the set of shift-minimal winning coalitions containing player i (provided that the game is complete). In order to specify a power index P it suffices to define the mapping for each coordinate

The next two definitions concern particular power indices. We mainly focus on “raw” power indices because the results in the paper do not depend on normalizations.

                      all are based on critical coalitions since they count subsets of critical coalitions containing a given player i. The Banzhaf index counts all critical coalitions for each player, while the Public Good index counts only the minimal and the Shift index only the shift-minimal ones. Thus, for each player we have the inclusion

                     Several power indices are based on counting a certain subset of coalitions (Kurz, 2014). As defined, several coalitions can be counted multiple times, e.g., a minimal winning coalition S is counted for every player i contained in S in the computation of

                     . If one wants to avoid this characteristic and instead count each distinguished coalition just once, then one can divide ‘spoils’ of each coalition equally among its critical members. This general construction is called equal division version of a given power index (based on counting functions) (Kurz, 2014). Applying this construction on our first set of power indices we obtain the following.

Note that in the two last definitions the cardinality of S is the same as the number of critical players in S, since all players in minimal winning (or in shift-minimal winning) coalitions are critical in them.

As it is well-known the Banzhaf and the Johnston indices (and the Shapley–Shubik too) satisfy both the dominance property and local monotonicity since all of them preserve the desirability relation (see, e.g., Freixas et al., 2012). The other power indices previously introduced in Section 2 and extensively analyzed in this paper do not preserve the desirability relation and consequently fail to fulfill both the dominance and the local monotonicity properties (see e.g., Felsenthal and Machover, 1998; Freixas and Gambarelli, 1997; Freixas et al., 2012).

The purpose of this section is to provide subclasses of games precisely defined in next definition satisfying the dominance property or the local-monotonicity for the Public Good and the Deegan–Packel indices.

                        Definition 11
                        A simple game is:

                              
                                 1.
                                 
                                    uniform if all minimal winning coalitions have the same cardinality,


                                    uniform complete if it is both complete and uniform,


                                    uniform weighted if it is both weighted and uniform.

As an abbreviation we denote the corresponding subclasses by 
                        
                           U
                           ,
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              U
                              c
                           
                           ,
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              U
                              w
                           
                           ,
                        
                      respectively. Obviously, a uniform weighted game is a uniform complete game and a uniform complete game is a uniform game, while the converses are not true.

The second observation is that if a game is uniform then all shift-minimal winning coalitions have the same cardinality because 
                        
                           S
                           ⊆
                           M
                        
                      for all simple game. However the converse is also true, i.e., if all shift-minimal winning coalitions have the same cardinality then all the minimal winning coalitions have the same cardinality too. This is because the coalitions in 
                        
                           M
                           ∖
                           S
                        
                      are obtained from those in 
                        S
                      by one-to-one replacements of weaker players, according to the desirability relation, for stronger players; but these exchanges do not affect the cardinalities of the coalitions involved. Hence, we can exchange in previous definition the term “minimal winning coalition” by “shift-minimal winning coalition”.

If l is the cardinality of all minimal winning coalitions in a uniform game, in any of its forms, then 
                        
                           M
                           =
                           M
                           (
                           l
                           )
                        
                      where 
                        
                           M
                           (
                           l
                           )
                        
                      is the set of minimal winning coalitions of cardinality l.

Despite the restrictive definition of uniform complete games, their number grow exponentially in the number of players. For instance, there are (see, e.g., Freixas & Puente, 2008; Kurz & Tautenhahn, 2013)

                      provides enumerations for small values of n on the number of uniform complete games (

                           Let v be a uniform complete game, characterized by

                        Corollary 1
                        
                           The Public Good and Deegan–Packel indices satisfy dominance and local monotonicity properties on the classes
                           
                              
                                 U
                                 c
                              
                            
                           and
                           
                              
                                 
                                    U
                                    w
                                 
                                 ,
                              
                            
                           respectively.
                        

As a consequence, for uniform complete games the ranking given by the desirability relation coincides with the rankings given by Public Good and Deegan–Packel indices. So these rankings also coincide with the rankings of the Shapley–Shubik, Banzhaf, and Johnston indices because these indices also satisfy dominance, see Freixas et al. (2012).

It is remarkable to note that there are previous studies done on studying subclasses of weighted games satisfying local monotonicity for the Public Good index. However, these led to subclasses whose cardinalities grow polynomially on the number of players, see Holler and Napel (2004). (To be more precise, these subclasses are based on the addition of null players to some games with few players satisfying local monotonicity.) Nevertheless, the work we develop in next sections illustrates that local monotonicity is hardly achievable for the Public Good index if we choose a game at random with a large number of voters. Notwithstanding of this fact we think it is noteworthy the identification of subclasses of simple games satisfying the dominance property, for several power indices, with exponential growth on the number of players. Although compared with other subclasses of games the (exponential) growth of uniform complete games may seem limited.

The Public Good and the Deegan–Packel indices are locally monotonic for uniform games. However, this condition is not necessary as the following example illustrates.

Then the layer relation, ≿, is a preordering on N, i.e., a reflexive and transitive relation.

                        Definition 13
                        A simple game v on N is flat whenever ≿, the layer relation on N, is total.

Thus, in a flat simple game, we either have i≿j or j≿i for all i, j ∈ N. Nevertheless the subclass of uniform games has been presented separately by its: simpler structure and easier identification and enumeration.

We remark that i⊐j, 
                        
                           i

                           ⊐
                           j
                        
                      implies 
                        
                           
                              DP
                              i
                              r
                           
                           >
                           
                              DP
                              j
                              r
                           
                        
                     . Note further that uniform games are particular cases of flat games, for which the mentioned implication is not valid in general.

                        Proposition 2
                        
                           Let v be a flat complete game, characterized by
                           
                              W
                            
                           and N, then the Public Good and Deegan–Packel indices satisfy the dominance property.
                        

As v is a complete game it is either i⊐j or j⊐i for all i, j ∈ N. Assume from now on i⊐j.

As v is flat, either i≿j or j≿i for all i, j ∈ N. We shall see that i⊐j implies i≿j.

                      be a finite set of power indices, e.g.

                           since the αj
                            are non-negative.

If the Pj
                            are invariant for nulls, then they have to satisfy the null player property. From (1) we deduce that 
                              
                                 P

                            also satisfies the null player property. Thus it suffices to prove

The big drawback of this exact approach is the usually large size of the set of n-player games of 
                        G
                     . Both sets of n-player complete or weighted games grow faster than exponential. The exact numbers have been determined up to 
                        
                           n

                      there are 284 432 730 174 complete and 993 061 482 weighted games.

                        Which had to be slightly corrected recently Kartak, Kurz, Ripatti, and Scheithauer (2015).
                      Thus, using Lemma 6 becomes computationally infeasible for n > 9. So we propose an integer linear programming formulation in the next section.

Whenever one is interested in complete games or weighted games, which are extremal with respect to a certain criterion, exhaustive enumeration is not a feasible option for n > 9 players (see the enumeration results stated at the end of the previous section). An alternative is to specify the set games indirectly by binary variables and linear inequalities. If the extremality criterion can be also formulated using integer variables and linear constraints, then integer linear programming techniques can be applied. In the context of cooperative games this approach was introduced in Kurz (2012b) and also applied in this context in Freixas and Kurz (2014), Kurz (2014), Kurz and Napel (2014).

For completeness, we briefly repeat the integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of a game v. Since v is uniquely characterized by its values v(S) for all coalitions S ∈ 2
                        N
                     , we introduce binary variables xS
                      ∈ {0, 1} for all S ∈ 2
                        N
                     . The conditions for a simple game can be stated as 
                        
                           
                              x

                              x
                              N
                           
                           =
                           1

                      and xS
                      ≤ xT
                      for all S⊆T⊆N. We remark that for the later set of inequalities it suffices to consider the pairs of coalitions where 
                        
                           |

In order to restrict v to weighted games we additionally have to introduce weights wi
                      ≥ 0 and a quota q > 0, where we assume that the weight of each winning coalition is larger than the weight of each losing coalition by at least one. (We may simply use integer weights, which could result in harder problems for the ILP solver.) To interlink the xS
                      with the wi
                      and q we use

                     So in the following we can restrict our considerations on coalitions S such that for each i ∈ S we either have

Since each shift-minimal winning coalition has to be a minimal winning coalition, we require uS
                      ≤ zS
                      for all S ∈ 2
                        N
                     . The other possibility disqualifying a coalition S from being a shift-minimal winning coalition is the existence of player i ∈ S\{n} with 
                        
                           i

                           S

                           1
                        
                      such that

                      then the proposed inequality is trivially satisfied. So we assume otherwise. In the cases where n ∈ S we can similarly assume

                           0
                        
                     . In this remaining case we have the implication 
                        
                           
                              u

                      which is correct since no certificate for not being a shift-minimal winning coalition exists, so that S is a shift-minimal winning coalition.

Finally consider the case where S indeed is a shift-minimal winning coalition. Thus 
                        
                           
                              x

                     . Remember that we need the implication uS
                      ≥ 1 just for the coalitions S, where for each player i ∈ S we either have

                           1

                     . So we can assume 
                        
                           i
                           ⊐

                      for all indices i in the summation. Thus

                      that is locally monotonic for all weighted games (independently of the number of players) is the raw Banzhaf index itself. For a fixed finite number of players it may still be possible that the cost of local monotonicity is strictly less than 1.

Having the ILP approach from the previous section at hand we can also determine the exact value of the cost of local monotonicity for a small number of players. It turns out that the lower bound from Lemma 8 is tight for all n ≤ 10. So, especially for n ≤ 3 we have a cost of local monotonicity of zero, which goes in line with the fact that all weighted games with at most 3 players are locally monotonic. Although the ILP approach can move the computational limit of exhaustive enumeration a bit, it is so far limited to n ≤ 10. Since we were not able to find improving examples, we state:

We remark that the extremal examples are not unique, e.g., we have the weighted games [4; 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1], [10; 10, 8, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2] and [7; 7, 6, 6, 6, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1] also meeting the bound from Lemma 8 for

For combinations of the Banzhaf score and the Shift score the lower bound of Corollary 4 is tight for n ≤ 6. For 7 ≤ n ≤ 11 we were able to compute improving examples.

For the upper bounds we have applied the ILP approach.□

We have already stated some other tight examples before. We would highlight just another tight example, where the bound is met between the second and the third player, for

We provide a general construction meeting the cost of local monotonicity of the best known examples for all n ≥ 6:

The coalition {1, 2} is a minimal winning coalition in any case. We can easily check that it is shift-minimal winning if and only if k > 1. Since the weight of (1, 0, k, 0) exactly equals the quota, the corresponding unique coalition is shift-minimal in any case. Now assume that a coalition S of type (1, 0, a, b) is shift-minimal winning. Since S has to be winning, we have

For the upper bounds we have applied the ILP approach.□

Since the parametric example from Lemma 8 and the examples from Lemma 9 and Lemma 10 have the property that the sum of weights meets or exceeds twice the quota, the respective games are all strong. Thus, the same results are valid if we restrict the class of weighted games to weighted strong games. Clearly we also conjecture

Observe that the parametric example from Lemma 11 and the examples from Lemma 12 are not strong, so the cost of local monotonicity may decrease for constant sum weighted games compared to proper weighted games.

If we consider the subclass of constant-sum games within the class of weighted games, then the non-monotonicity is generally reduced, i.e., a lower contribution of the Banzhaf score is sufficient to guarantee local monotonicity of the power index obtained as a convex combination.

In the previous section we have computationally determined the cost of local monotonicity for several sets of two or three power indices on subclasses of weighted games. Now we want to gain even more information: Given a collection 
                        P
                      of r ≥ 2 power indices, for which

                              S
                              r
                           
                        
                      does 
                        
                           P
                           
                              α
                              ,
                              P
                           
                        
                      satisfy local monotonicity? In Lemma 2 we have obtained the result that the respective set

                      so that the determination of the polyhedron is completed.

We remark that α′′ does also attain the cost of local monotonicity for 
                        
                           {
                           
                              Bz
                              r
                           
                           ,
                           
                              S
                              r
                           
                           }
                        
                     . So if we had started with the games v
                     1 and v
                     3 instead of v
                     1 and v
                     2, our algorithm would have needed one iteration less.

A similar result is obtained for the three other indices considered in the paper:

                            is the counting of relevant coalitions for each player, where relevant is specified differently in each case. The Shapley–Subik index weights critical coalitions with respect to their size, while the Banzhaf index treats all critical coalitions equally.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have introduced the concept of considering convex combinations of power indices. Several of the main properties of power indices are preserved by convexity, i.e., given a collection 
                        P
                      of power indices such that each power index in 
                        P
                      has a certain property, then also every convex combination of the power indices in 
                        P
                      has this property. Lemma 1 gives some examples of such properties being preserved by convexity. The freedom in choosing the multipliers almost arbitrarily enables us to search for power indices, which satisfy some other useful properties. As an application we study local monotonicity. It is well known that the Public Good index does not satisfy local monotonicity, while e.g. the Banzhaf index does. So, what proportion of the Banzhaf index is necessary so that a convex combination of both indices becomes locally monotonic? The newly introduced cost of local monotonicity answers this specific question. Similar measures may of course be introduced for other properties of power indices.

It turns out that with an increasing number of players the weight of the Banzhaf index needs to tend to 1. For a finite number of players there is still some freedom to incorporate some information from the Public Good index, while maintaining the local monotonicity of the Banzhaf index.

Restricting the class of the underlying games to strong or proper games typically decreases the cost of local monotonicity, but does not change the general behavior.

The cost of local monotonicity for combinations of the Banzhaf and the Shift index is considerably higher. So, in some sense the Shift index is even less locally monotonic than the Public Good index. Replacing the Banzhaf-, Public Good-, and the Shift indices by their so-called equal division versions, i.e., the Johnston-, the Deegan–Packel and the Shift–Deegan Packel index, generally results in lower costs of local monotonicity. For instance, we can compare the cost of local monotonicity of the Banzhaf and the Public Good index, see Lemma 8 and Conjecture 1, with the cost of local monotonicity of the Johnston and the Deegan–Packel indices, see Lemma 15. Nevertheless, the corresponding cost of local monotonicity approaches 1 as the number of players tends to infinity.

So, our study has shed some light on the property of local monotonicity of some power indices. The methodology of considering convex combinations of power indices in order to obtain some desirable properties is quite general and the presented theoretical and algorithmic framework may be applied in further studies.
