                  Mathematical modelling has been used to comprehend the pathology and the assessment of different treatment techniques such as heart failure and left ventricular assist device therapy in the cardiovascular field. In this study, an in-silico model of the heart is developed to understand the effects of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) as a pathological scenario, with mechanisms described at the cellular, protein and organ levels. This model includes the right and left atria and ventricles, as well as the systemic and pulmonary arteries and veins.
                  First, a multi-scale model of the whole heart is simulated for healthy conditions. Subsequently, the model is modified at its microscopic and macroscopic spatial scale to obtain the characteristics of IDC. The extracellular calcium concentration, the binding affinity of calcium binding proteins and the maximum and minimum elastances have been identified as key parameters across all relevant scales. The modified parameters cause a change in (a) intracellular calcium concentration characterising cellular properties, such as calcium channel currents or the action potential, (b) the proteins being involved in the sliding filament mechanism and the proportion of the attached crossbridges at the protein level, as well as (c) the pressure and volume values at the organ level. This model allows to obtain insight and understanding of the effects of the treatment techniques, from a physiological and biological point of view.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The use of mathematical models in the simulation of cardiac dynamics plays an important role in understanding cardiac physiology and pathology and possible treatment techniques. Early studies were performed to understand and simulate healthy cardiac dynamics at the physiological scale [1,2] or to describe cardiac contraction [3]. For example, researchers have developed several time varying elastance models for modelling the ventricular at the organ level. Mathematical functions took over the role to initiate the simulation of the haemodynamics at the organ level [4–10]. In these models, the activation function was defined using trigonometric, polynomial or exponential functions. In time varying elastance models, only blood pressure and volume can be simulated. However, in a failing heart a number of changes occur due to pathophysiologal mechanisms at different levels of biological organisation.

In this light, some models have tried to understand the underlying mechanisms of contraction by increasing the level of complexity of mathematical models used to describe them, via the addition of relevant processes at different biological scales. For instance, Arts et al. [11] described the relationship between left ventricular pressure and volume, as well as systolic fibre stress and strain in the wall [11] driven by an activation function to simulate the haemodynamics over a cardiac cycle. This model simulates the contraction of a single fibre at microstructural level, and extends this to a complete ellipsoid ventricle at microscopic level assuming homogeneous distribution and function of all muscle fibres, thus rendering ventricular haemodynamics. Cox et al. [12] used this model to describe the right ventricular haemodynamics in a healthy and pathological configuration by modifying the wall volume and zero pressure volume in the left ventricle [12]. Díaz-Zuccarini and LeFevre [13] modelled the contraction of a sarcomere and defined the ventricle as a cylinder. Also here, the ventricular dynamics were obtained with the assumption of a uniform sarcomere distribution in the ventricle.

Other models focus on cardiac cells and include the generation of the action potential. For example, the Luo–Rudy model [14] is widely used in electrophysiological literature to describe the ion fluxes and channel currents of a ventricular myocyte resulting in the transmembrane (action) potential. The numerical reconstruction of the ventricular action potential is based on a Hodgkin–Huxley type approach [15]. An advanced model of the Luo–Rudy model is given by Livshitz and Rudy [16] accounting for the ion channel kinetics, calcium handling, and dynamic changes in the intracellular/extracellular milieu during the action potential. To consider the relevance of intracellular calcium dynamics during the excitation contraction coupling process (ECCP) of a myocyte, the sliding filament model (SFM) [17] describes its interaction and sensitivity with myofilaments within a sarcomere at the protein level.

The cardiac cell models mentioned above have been used to simulate physiological and clinical situations. However, these models do not take into account the connection between different biological scales, which is crucial for understanding cardiac physiology as a holistic process. Various approaches have been undertaken to understand the coupling between microscopic and macroscopic elements of the cardiac contraction and its physical mechanisms using mathematical models. Bhattacharya-Ghosh et al. presented a blueprint for a multi-scale model of the ventricle [18]. This model describes events in which relevant mechanisms are mathematically described and coupled at the protein, cellular and organ scales in order to provide a better understanding of the combined ECCP as a whole. However, this model does not incorporate the four heart compartments and circulatory loop.

In this work, a model of the heart and circulation, involving the representation of multiple scales and multiple physical processes based on [18] is presented under healthy conditions at first. Subsequently, the model is applied for a case study of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), which is the most common type of non-ischemic (i.e. not related to coronary artery disease) cardiomyopathy and a major cause of congestive heart failure [19].

The case of IDC was chosen as an example because its hypertrophic effects at the organ level are relatively simple to illustrate. The dilation of the heart is rather complex in terms of modelling, as it involves changes at the cellular and protein level as well. Cardiomyopathies are conventionally treated with inotropic support, diuretics and moderate exercise, or a mechanical circulatory assist device implantation [20]. The optimum choice of treatment is patient specific and not always clear.

Within this case study, specific adjustments undertaken at each scale (cellular, protein and organ level) of a healthy heart model demonstrate typical symptoms of IDC and the feasibility of using multi-scale models as a way to understand complex diseases.

A multi-scale model (MSM) of the heart has been developed, with biological scales ranging from the protein to the organ level. A schematic diagram of the multi-scale model of the whole heart from the protein (microscopic) level to the organ (macroscopic) level is shown in [18].

The different components of this model will be described in the following sub-sections.

In this model, the contraction of the heart was initiated by the physiological processes based on the ventricular MSM, incorporating the Livshitz–Rudy (LR) model [16] at its cellular level for the generation of an action potential.

The cardiac action potential is generated by the orchestrated activity of a number of depolarising and repolarising currents, such Na+, K+, and Ca²+.

                        . The action potential is generated by the change in total concentration of each specific ion. There is strong interdependency between all other ions involved to describe the process of ventricular contraction and relaxation.

In vivo, pacemaker cells initiate an electrical signal, propagating from one cell to adjacent cells and leading to their contraction. In this model, a stimulus current of 0.5ms in duration and a strength of 80µA/cm² with a pulse frequency equal to the heart rate, excites the entire system.

Ca2+ currents play a major role for the ECCP as its intracellular concentration is tightly regulated at different levels. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+] is the basic prerequisite initiating the process of contraction in the ECCP, as [Ca2+] determines the strength of contraction [21]. A normal Ca²+ homoeostasis is important for an efficient heart beat and its muscle contraction and myocardial excitability [22].

The LR model accounts for the dynamic changes in ionic concentrations, such as [Ca2+], buffers for [Ca2+] like calmodulin (cmdn) and troponin (trpn) in the myoplasma, and ionic fluxes during the action potential. The [Ca2+] is the key signalling ion that initiates the contraction of the heart within this model. Its calculation is based on the “conservation of calcium” described in [16] determined at the cellular level by Eq. (2)

The applied MSM uses [Ca2+] to connect the cellular level (LR model) to the protein level (SFM) [17].

At the protein level, the sliding filament model (SFM) represents the interactions between [Ca2+] and the cardiac myofilaments within a sarcomere. It describes the crossbridge kinetics (
                        Fig. 1) based on the evaluation of data from isolated hearts in guinea pigs. The amount of crossbridges

                        , determined in the sliding filament model (SFM), is also intimately related to [Ca2+], and therefore also provides an indication of the strength of contraction in the heart. Responsible for this contraction mechanism in cardiac muscle at the sarcomere level are two protein chains. The actin–myosin sliding mechanism is well documented in cardiac literature [25] and is based on the chemical reactions of attachment and detachment between the actin (
                           A
                        ) and myosin (
                           M
                        ) chains. The sliding mechanism between the actin (
                           A
                        ) and myosin (
                           M
                        ) filaments [26,27] is shown in Fig. 1, with dependence on the binding of Ca2+ to troponin C (
                           T
                           n
                           C
                        ) on the actin myofilament (
                           T
                           n
                           C
                           A
                        ).

The protein tropomyosin, blocks actin from binding in the relaxed state of sarcomere contraction. During state 1 (top left) there is no force generated by myosinheads due to their detached phase. Following, calcium binds to troponin C (
                           T
                           n
                           C
                        ) and exposes the crossbridge binding sites from tropomyosin (state 2) to allow myosinheads attach in the next state 3. Ca2+ then is bound and myosinheads are in an attached state [28]. During a so called “powerstroke” the thin filaments are forced (pulled) away from its original position and the length of the sarcomere is shortened in state 4, that represents a non Ca2+-bound and force generating state.

In order to be consistent with the units between the scales, the concentrations in the Livshitz–Rudy model were converted to µM before linking the cellular level to the protein scale.

The different states of the SFM are governed by the following ordinary differential equations (ODE) based on [17]. Eqs. (6)–(11) represent the processes shown in Fig. 1, in which “[…]” represent one protein complex.

At the organ level, this model describes the force and pressure generation in the LV based on the fundamental electro-mechanical activity of the heart coupled with the chemo-mechanical transduction occurring at the protein level within cardiomyocytes, which allows us to calculate the energy of the cardiac muscle

                         the minimum sarcomere length.

The same equations as in the MSM of the LV, are used to describe the right ventricle with a lower maximum characteristic elastance. The maximum characteristic elastance of the right ventricle (1.75mmHg/ml) was chosen in order to obtain the desired haemodynamical values in the model, whereas the elastance of 5mmHg/ml for the left ventricle originates from Díaz-Zuccarini et al. [13].

An overview of the scales described in the previous sub-sections and the parameters considered to interlink them is presented in [18].

To represent the circulatory system, Windkessel [30] models are widely used in the literature. In its simplest form, a Windkessel model consists of two lumped parameters: a resistance and a compliance [31], which are attributed to blood vessels. The electric elements have explicit physiological meaning: while the resistance depends on the radius, the compliance corresponds to the elasticity of the vessel. Three-element Windkessel models additionally include an inertance effect.

In the model of the circulation presented in 
                        Fig. 2 the main blood vessels (systemic and pulmonary arteries and veins) are modelled using electrical analogues [32].

C, R and L denote the compliances, resistances and inertances, respectively, while their indices indicate the compartment of systemic arteries (as), systemic veins (vs), pulmonary arteries (ap) and pulmonary veins (vp).

The flow from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles to the arteries are dependent on the pressure gradients. The left ventricular volume change

                        The right atrial pressure change was described in the same way using the right atrial compliance, and the corresponding flow rates.

The heart valves were modelled as ideal diodes which allow only one way blood flow. The blood flow

                         denote the pressure in the systemic arteries and the left ventricle. The blood flow through the other valves is determined in the same manner. These allow blood to pass through the valve (i.e. resistance is low), whereas the blood is blocked by the valve when the resistance is high.

Systemic and pulmonary arteries were modelled with R, C, L analogues. In the models of systemic and pulmonary veins, resistance and compliance effects were taken into account.

The flow rate and pressure changes in systemic and pulmonary veins, as well as pulmonary arteries were described using the electrical analogue as given in [32]. These electrical analogues and the ventricular model described previously were combined in order to simulate a closed loop cardiovascular system (multi-scale) model.


                        
                        Fig. 3 shows the dependency between particular variables in the mathematical model across the distinct scales. The complexity of the cellular and organ level has been reduced in this figure to the essential key elements.

Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) is a disease of the cardiac muscle and is characterised by a dilated weaker left ventricle. Hence, its ability to efficiently pump blood is reduced.

The causes of IDC are unknown but they are often related to chronic alcohol abuse, use of beta-adrenergic agonists, or hypertension [33,34]. Patients suffering from premature ventricular contractions, also referred to as extrasystole, can develop dilated cardiomyopathy. Further studies on the reductions and removal of extrasystole have confirmed the findings of the cardiomyopathy regressing [35,36]. Before a patient is diagnosed with IDC the exclusion of any other cardiac, pulmonary or systemic disease showing a similar phenotype is required [37].

Congestive heart failure can have typical symptoms, such as shortness of breath and swelling of the legs due to retention of fluids. It may also cause the formation blood clots in the heart because of poor blood circulation.

A failing myocardium, as it occurs in IDC, is known to display an abnormal intracellular Ca2+ handling, which also comprises an isoform switching of the myofilaments and a shift of the kinetics in crossbridge cycling [38]. Patients with IDC usually are anticipated to show abnormal relaxation kinetics [39,40]. The myofilament Ca2+ responsiveness is distinguished by the relation between force and intracellular Ca2+. The normal behaviour and values will be altered due to the “remodelling” caused by IDC. Typically, a lower force is produced with a decrease in Ca2+ or a decrease in myofilament function, even if the Ca2+ transients remain unchanged [38]. In dilated cardiomyopathy Ca2+ transients are prolonged and myosin chains [41] are altered in the failing heart in strong correlation with its contractility [42,43]. A shift of the crossbridge kinetics to lower ranges slows down the crossbridge cycling [44] and may be the reason why a higher intracellular Ca2+ concentration can produce little or no increment in contractile force [45].

Pieske et al. [46] supports the findings that disturbed intracellular Ca2+ handling, leading to a depressed function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) [47], may be a major pathological factor for altered contractile function in human dilated cardiomyopathy.

A decrease in extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]o) is typically related to a decrease in [Ca2+]. Subsequently, a smaller influx, hence a smaller current through the main calcium channel (L-type-channel) and an efflux of calcium ions via other channels and the SR occurs into and out of the myocyte. A reduction in the calcium dynamics and force leads to disturbances in the ECCP and [Ca2+] handling [48]. The decrease in [Ca2+] also represents a smaller amount of calcium being taken up by the SR. Additionally, Mercadier et al., [49] confirms that the velocity of SR Ca2+ uptake is decreased during a volumetric increase in the ventricle and is further depressed in pathological cases. Also, taking into consideration the assumption that not only a decrease in [Ca2+], but moreover differences in myofibrillar calcium responsiveness lead to abnormalities of contractile function in the failing myocardium [50], the model will also take into account the crossbridge kinetics at the protein level [38] adds that even if myofilament responsiveness remains unchanged, the force can highly increase just on the basis of an increase of [Ca2+]. In terms of the protein mechanisms [41], [51] suggests that the myosin light chain and heavy chain isoforms are altered in heart failure. The slowing of the crossbridge cycling rate plays an important adaptational role in terms of cardiac contractility changes [44]. In order to achieve these effects the dissociation rate of Ca²+ with Troponin C on the actin myofilament with

A dilation of the left ventricle does not mean that the muscular activity (force) will increase. Actually, the thinning of the muscular wall makes the Frank–Starling mechanism fail in the case of IDC. A rightward shift of the left ventricular P–V relation is typical according to the tendency toward increased ventricular volumes in chronic heart failure [52].

Findings for IDC suggested by [39,53,54] as a result of lowered elastance of the ventricular wall and alterations at the cellular and protein level leading to the typical and obtained effects of IDC are shown within the multi-scale model presented here.

For this case study, and in order to capture the different aspects of IDC mentioned above, a number of parameters were changed from the ‘healthy’ heart model to represent the ‘diseased’ one. The parameter set to be modified was kept relatively small. The previously mentioned changes during IDC, are characterised within this study by modifying appropriate key parameters in the multi-scale model. The parameters representing the typical characteristics occurring during IDC, are chosen from each scale presented – protein, cellular and organ, while the central role of Ca2+ in regulating muscle contraction [22] has been taken into account.

At the protein level, the shift in the myofilament function is demonstrated by a reduction of the binding affinity

                        . A decrease in the dynamics of the intracellular calcium concentration, affecting the strength of contraction, is tightly related to a decrease in the constant extracellular concentration [Ca2+]. The dilation of the ventricle is closely connected to the ventricular wall stiffness, arising from the maximum elastance

                        Table 3. The consequences of the IDC are well-known and the affected parameters are reported in the literature. However, the quantitative change rate of these parameters remains unclear. Therefore we changed these parameters to obtain an IDC heart considering the parameters of interest and similar values in the literature. The modification of these will let us obtain the volume and pressure curves typically resulting from IDC.

As previously mentioned, a number of parameters were modified (Table 3) from the original model in order to simulate IDC. Simulations reached a steady state after 15s of simulation time. The results are given for 1s time span in steady state. Simulations were performed using the MATLAB Simulink solver ODE23tb with a maximum step size of 0.25ms. While the results presented in [18] were obtained using ODE113, ODE23tb delivered the required accuracy of results within a notable shorter simulation time.

The normal heart rate changes between 53bpm and 89bpm [55], while a body surface area of a 170cm (height) and 70kg individual is approximately 1.8m2 
                     [55]. Thus, the heart rate was kept at 60bpm while a body surface area of 1.8m2 was assumed to calculate the cardiac index.

A reduced [Ca2+] transient (
                        Fig. 4) can be observed as shown in [56] for isolated myocytes from failing human hearts. It supports the findings of [48,57], that disturbed [Ca2+] may be the major pathological factor for altered contractile function in human IDC. The altered extracellular calcium concentration leads to the intracellular changes which affects the protein and organ levels. A reduced wall stiffness and a decrease in the crossbridge kinetics (Fig. 6) towards the diastolic phase let us to obtain typical symptoms of IDC 
                        Fig. 5.

The negative decrease in the initial peak of the L-type calcium channel partly characterises the lower peak of the action potential, describing the transmembral potential over the ECCP, as it is calculated by the sum of all channel currents.

The identification of appropriate links at the protein scale, to obtain effects of IDC across different scales, has been investigated. This has led to the finding that a decrease of the dissociation rates and Ca2+-binding affinity favouring the state of relaxation (Fig. 1, State 1), is causing an increase in the concentration of unoccupied binding sites between myosinheads (crossbridges) (
                        Fig. 6) and actin.

Hence, in the case of IDC more actin and myosin filaments are available with less of these proteins being involved in the ECCP [5]. Extrapolated to the organ scale it confirms the described characteristics of a weakened heart and its impaired function to pump blood.

Further on this study, to show the effects of IDC at the protein level the dissociation rate of TnCA and M in absence of bound Ca2+ (

                        , producing a less strong contraction in case of IDC than in the healthy heart.

At the organ level we obtain ventricular, arterial and atrial pressures for the healthy and IDC models as shown in 
                        Fig. 7.

In the healthy heart model, the left ventricular pressure ranges between 4mmHg and 118mmHg while the aortic pressure changes between 74mmHg and 118mmHg. A reduced elastance in the left ventricle initiates a decrease in the end-systolic pressure due to weakened contractility in the left ventricle. This causes a decrease in both systolic and diastolic aortic pressures. Also, the end-diastolic left ventricular pressure increases to around 13mmHg. A higher left ventricular filling pressure causes an increase in the left atrial pressure. In the healthy heart model, the right ventricular pressure varies between 2mmHg and 26mmHg while the pulmonary arterial pressure changes between 12mmHg and 26mmHg. In the IDC model, the right ventricular end-systolic pressure rises significantly while the filling pressure is reduced in the right ventricle because of a lowered left ventricular output. The pulmonary arterial pressure rises because of a higher end-systolic pressure in the right ventricle while its amplitude reduces. Left and right ventricular volumes for the healthy heart and IDC heart models are given in 
                        Fig. 8.

The end-systolic left ventricular volume is 53ml while the end-diastolic volume is 134ml for the healthy heart model. The right ventricular volume varies between 32ml and 113ml for the healthy model. A reduced contractility causes a significant increase in left ventricular volume. The left ventricular end-systolic volume becomes 167ml due to a reduced peak pressure in the left ventricle. The end-diastolic volume becomes 229ml in the IDC heart model. The right ventricular end-systolic volume is 41ml because of the reduced right atrial preload in the IDC heart model, while the end-diastolic volume is reduced to 62ml due to higher afterload. The stroke volume reduces significantly in both ventricles.

The haemodynamic results are summarised for the healthy heart and the IDC heart models in 
                        Table 4 and compared with data from according literature [33,39,58–67].

Additional results were obtained applying a variation in the baseline parameters of ±10%, in order to explore the sensitivity of the model to variations in these parameters. 
                        Table 5 summarises these results.

The change in the left ventricular volume and pressure affects the preload and afterload of the right ventricle and will have an effect on the pressure and volume levels of the right ventricle. However, this will only be an indirect effect, as the baseline parameters are modified in the left ventricular model. We present the left ventricular P–V loops, for the different parameter values in 
                        Fig. 9.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

The importance of multi-scale modelling and their potential of simulating and providing examples of biomedical modelling scenarios being generated through the study of physiology by computational means [68] has rapidly grown over the last years. Only a few multi-scale models, including the generation of force and the calcium dynamics along the protein, cellular and organ scale [69–71], have investigated pathological cases, such as the thickening of the ventricular wall [72,73] approaching this pathology on the tissue level.

The aim of this study was to provide an in silico tool able to describe and explain key aspects of IDC taking into account different biological levels. Within this scope, an extended multi-scale model is presented and applied to simulate the haemodynamics in a healthy cardiovascular system. This model was then extended for a case study on failing hearts. A pathological case study of IDC, when the ventricle becomes weak and dilated over a cardiac cycle was demonstrated. Our results show that a change on the key parameters across all scales, can reproduce the main symptoms of IDC at the organ level.

The extracellular calcium concentration, binding affinity and left ventricular maximum and minimum characteristic elastances were modified in order to simulate the modified response of the model an IDC case. While our findings have shown that the presented combination of modifications of these parameters resulted in the effects of IDC, as expected and described in the literature, the “elastance” at the organ level plays a dominant role for the in silico case of IDC.

As mentioned before, in an IDC patient the cardiac output, cardiac index and ejection fraction are reduced remarkably because of an impaired function of the ventricle. In the healthy and IDC heart models, these parameters are in a good agreement with data reported in the literature (Table 4). The left ventricular volume was in the appropriate range for both healthy and IDC heart models. The end-systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular pressures along with the systolic and diastolic arterial pressures are in a physiological range for the healthy heart model. However, systolic and diastolic aortic pressures become lower than the physiological range, likewise the mean aortic pressure. It is difficult to ascertain causes for this. It may be explained with the arterial resistance, heart rate and total blood volume being constant in this model, whereas these parameters change in vivo.

The end-systolic and end-diastolic right ventricular pressures are also within the healthy physiological range as well as the pulmonary arterial pressure during systole and diastole. For the IDC heart model, diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure are within typical haemodynamical physiological boundaries, whereas the systolic pulmonary arterial pressure becomes lower than expected, although there is an increase in the IDC heart model.

The developed model provides a large number of parameters to simulate different physiological scenarios. Inotropes, for example, would lead to an acute stimulation of contractility (positive inotropic effect) resulting in an elevated cardiac output and increased blood pressure for the blood perfusion in the organs and tissues [74–76]. The inotropic effects of drug agents are likely linked to a consequence of widespread phosphorylation of Ca2+ handling proteins by cyclic adenylate monophosphate (cAMP) [77]. Furthermore some of the inotropes can inhibit the breakdown of cAMP in cardiac muscle cells and pulmonary vasodilator agent with little effect on systemic arterial blood pressure [78,79]. These inhibitors increase cardiac muscle contractility by a common final pathway that results in increased intracellular cAMP levels [80]. Inotropes are also used in heart failure patients implanted with an LVAD. A prolonged duration of inotropic support after an LVAD implantation may affect the right ventricular function [81].

In this study we present a large scale dynamical system which consists of subsystems and different scales. Input–output stability of such a system can be obtained treating the original system as an interconnection of its subsystems [82]. However, the analysis of the dynamical stability is not in the scope of this paper. In this paper we aim to present a dynamical model in order to simulate the IDC condition with possible reasons in different scales.

The novelty of the current model is that it takes into account: the four heart compartments, the circulatory loop, and most importantly the case study of an IDC condition. It can produce the main symptoms of IDC at the organ level which validated the model parameters. The clinical data is needed in order to validate the parameter changes in the cellular and organ levels. Although the parameters were changed in an intuitive way in these levels, the changed parameters were taken from literature. This model could potentially be used as a tool for simulating the effects of different treatment techniques such as drug therapy applied before or during the LVAD support. Thus, it would allow to understand effects of drug treatment in conjunction with circulatory support treatment techniques. While the focus of this paper is to show the capability and feasibility of the developed multi-scale model to simulate the haemodynamics for a healthy and a pathological case, the effects of the inotropes and LVAD support is considered for ongoing research.

There are limitations to this model due to the complexity of mechanisms spanning different scales. In an IDC patient, the total blood volume increases in order to maintain the perfusion level. We did not include that regulatory mechanism in the model. Introducing such a mechanism would involve a description of the change of the blood volume which means that the renal function must be identified in the patients. Identifying such a mechanism in case of IDC needs elaborated experiments and system identification tools. Also, the dependency along all presented scales and alterations potentially caused by other parameters describing the submodels (SFM, LR model, LV model), which have not been modified within the scope of this study, need further and thorough investigation.

But it also should be considered, that while the consequences of the IDC are known and the parameters affected at the microscopic and macroscopic scale are reported in the literature, the quantitative change of these parameters remains unclear.

The presented whole heart model demonstrated its feasibility to simulate, reproduce and comprehend the effects of IDC in a multi-scale model by modifying key parameters, such as intracellular calcium (cellular level), crossbridge kinetics (protein level) and ventricular wall elastance (organ level).

The presented multi-scale model could be applied potentially to simulate the effects of other pathological cases, abnormalities in the heart or pharmacological intervention studying cause-effect relationships from the microscopic to the macroscopic level for future work.
