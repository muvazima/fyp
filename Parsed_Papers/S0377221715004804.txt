                  Mammography is known to be the most effective way of breast cancer detection. The efficacy of mammography screening guidelines is highly associated with women's compliance with these recommendations. Currently, none of the existing policies takes women's behavior into consideration; instead, perfect adherence is assumed. However, an earlier longitudinal data analysis has revealed that women's compliance with mammography guidelines remained low in recent years. In this study, we develop a randomized discrete-time finite-horizon partially observable Markov chain model to evaluate a wide range of screening mammography policies, incorporating heterogeneity in women's adherence behaviors. Considering potential harms of mammography tests (e.g., risk of developing radiation-induced breast cancer, false negatives, false positives, etc.), policies with varying starting age, ending age and frequency of screening mammograms at different ages are compared in terms of total quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime breast cancer mortality risk. Our results show that women with perfect adherence do not always experience higher QALYs. In fact, for some policies, including the American Cancer Society (ACS) policy, the general population with various adherence levels has higher QALYs than women with perfect adherence. However, in terms of lifetime breast cancer mortality risk, higher/perfect adherence always results in lower risk of dying from breast cancer. This implies that the benefits of mammography in decreasing death from breast cancer outweigh the increased risk of developing radiation-induced breast cancer from mammographic screening. This study can facilitate healthcare providers to tailor screening mammography recommendations based on their patients' estimated adherence levels.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide in women contributing more than 25 percent of the total number of cancer cases diagnosed in 2012 (World Cancer Research Fund International, 2014). It is also the most common non-skin cancer affecting women in the United States. According to the American Cancer Society, about one in eight US women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. In 2015, an estimated 231,840 invasive breast cancer cases will be diagnosed, and about 40,290 will die from breast cancer (American Cancer Society, 2015).

Mammography plays an important role in detection of breast cancer when the cancer is in its early stage. It is known to be an effective method and the current standard practice for early diagnosis of breast cancer. On average, mammography can detect breast cancer 1.7 years before a woman can feel a lump in her breast (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). In addition, it can reduce breast cancer mortality rate by a reasonable estimate of 15 percent (Gøtzsche & Nielsen, 2009).

However, mammography screening recommendations have been the subject of significant debate in recent years.  There are varying screening guidelines from different organizations about when to start and end mammograms and how frequently a woman should undergo mammography screenings. For example, the American Cancer Society (ACS), the department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the American Medical Association (AMA), and the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommend screening mammography every year, beginning at age 40. In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued revised screening mammography guidelines, which resulted in a significant controversy. According to the USPSTF guidelines, screening mammograms should be done every two years between age 50 and 75 for women at average risk of breast cancer (The US Preventive Services Task Force, 2013).

Although mammography is known to be one of the most effective methods of detecting breast cancer, there are many concerns on its adverse effects on women's quality of life. Unreliability of mammography, i.e., false negative and false positive results and over-diagnosis are among the deficiencies of mammography (Epstein, Bertell, & Seaman, 2001). A prospective cohort study of 7 mammography registries of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) showed that the adjusted sensitivity increased with age from 68.6 percent in women ages 40–44 to 83.3 percent in women ages 80–89 (Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, 2013). Similarly, the specificity rate increased from 88.2 percent for women aged 40 through 44 years to 93.4 percent in women older than 75 (Carney et al., 2003). Moreover, about one-third of all aggressive cancers are diagnosed in the interval between successive annual mammograms (Epstein, Steinman, & LeVert, 1998). These cancers are known as interval cancers and are defined as cancers detected within 12 months after a negative mammogram (Burhenne et al., 1994). Some of the interval cancers are present at the time of mammography screening (false-negatives) while others grow rapidly in the interval between a mammogram and detection (Hébert-Croteau, Théberge, Langlois, Major, & Brisson, 2005). Generally, interval cancers grow rapidly and are frequently diagnosed at advanced stages (Caumo et al., 2010). In addition, studies have shown that receiving mammograms increases a woman's chance of developing breast cancer due to exposure to radiation (Epstein et al., 2001; Yaffe & Mainprize, 2011; Gøtzsche & Nielsen, 2009). Each radiation-absorbed dose (rad) of exposure increases breast cancer risk by 1 percent (Epstein et al., 2001). Moreover, Bleyer and Welch (2012) also found that up to a third of diagnosed breast cancers are overdiagnosed cases and do not need treatment.

Various studies have been conducted to evaluate and compare different screening policies or to identify optimal policies. Kirch and Klein (1974) developed an inspection strategy for the detection of an age-dependent disease with the objective of minimizing detection delay. To illustrate their methodology, they developed optimal schedules for breast cancer examinations. Shwartz (1978) developed a mathematical model to evaluate life expectancy gain associated with different screening policies under different assumptions about the rate of disease progression, the characteristics of the screening technique, and the frequency of screenings. Parmigiani (1993) presented a continuous time non-Markovian stochastic process model of disease progression to analyze which age groups and what part of the population should undergo breast cancer screening, while minimizing the total expected loss or risk including financial costs, side effects, wasted time, stress due to false-negative test results, etc. Zelen (1993) formulated a screening scheduling problem to maximize a weighted utility function in a continuous time setting. In Zelen's model all the parameters were assumed to be stationary except for the incidence rate. Baker (1998) used a mathematical parametric model to assess different screening policies in terms of minimizing the cost of cancer plus the cost of carrying out any screening. Baker's model was developed based on a small data set used to estimate the model parameters, and compares a small set of cost optimal policies under different sets of constraints. Maillart, Ivy, Ransom, and Diehl (2008) formulated a partially observable Markov chain model to evaluate a wide range of dynamic mammography screening policies as well as current practices. They compared different policies in terms of the resulting lifetime breast cancer mortality risk and the expected number of mammograms women should undergo for each policy and generated a frontier of efficient policies. In their formulation, they considered age-based dynamics of breast cancer (i.e., increasing incidence, decreasing aggression). They also incorporated the imperfect nature of the screening outcomes and dynamics of test result accuracy (increasing sensitivity and specificity rates with age). Ayer, Alagoz, and Stout (2011) developed a finite-horizon partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model to determine the optimal personalized mammography screening strategy based on personal risk characteristics of women such as their prior screening history. Ahern, Cheng, and Shen (2011) developed a mathematical model to optimize cancer screening schedules, taking into account the trade-off between the benefits and costs of screenings in their proposed utility function. They considered two different optimization frameworks: optimize the number of screening examinations with equal screening intervals between exams but without a pre-fixed total cost; and optimize the ages at which screening should be given for a fixed total cost and prove that the optimal solution exists under each of the two frameworks. Li, Zhu, Klein, and Kong (2014) developed a finite-horizon discrete-time partially observable Markov chain model to assess colonoscopy screening strategies in terms of the expected cumulative quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the expected cumulative cost. They also calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for different screening policies.

However, none of the abovementioned studies has taken patient behavior into consideration. They all assume that patients adhere to the guidelines perfectly and undergo the prescribed screening mammograms. This is also true for the current screening recommendations which are based on the assumption of 100 percent adherence to the guidelines. However, not all women have the same attitudes toward breast cancer screening. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that about 67.1 percent of women aged 40 and older had one mammogram between 2008 and 2010 (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). In another longitudinally data analysis of the BCSC data registry, more than 75 percent of women have had less than five mammograms in the 14-year interval, between 1996 and 2009, which implies a low compliance with the current guidelines (Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, 2013).

There are a limited number of studies taking individual adherence behavior into consideration. Brailsford, Harper, and Sykes (2012) used a three-phase discrete event simulation to model breast cancer and screening policies incorporating women's behavioral factors in their model. They assigned behavioral attributes to each simulated woman to control her compliance with the prescribed mammograms in their model. They compared a limited number of screening policies, including the current UK policy, in terms of the number of screen detected cancers, and life yeas saved. In another study, Ayer, Alagoz, Stout, and Burnside (2015) analyzed the role of behavioral heterogeneity in women's adherence on optimal mammography screening recommendations.

In this research, incorporating women's adherence behavior to mammography recommendations, a mathematical framework is proposed to evaluate and compare various screening policies in terms of QALYs and the lifetime mortality risk of breast cancer. Our study is different from the two studies discussed above in the approach of incorporating patient adherence to the screening tests. In contrast to earlier studies, we allow uncertainty in a patient's adherence probabilities in the model. Adherence is also a function of the length of the interval between two subsequent screenings. Moreover, assuming a patient's adherence behavior is related to and can be estimated from her perception/planning toward mammography, not only can we evaluate and compare screening policies for a specific patient knowing her personal characteristics, but we can identify efficient policies for the general population as well. In addition, we incorporate in our model the possibility of interval cancer detection, and the increased risk of developing breast cancer due to exposure to X-ray radiation during a mammography test.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the proposed model is presented. In Section 3, model inputs and parameters estimation, and computational results are presented. Finally, Section 4 summarizes the findings and discusses future work.

A randomized discrete-time finite-horizon partially observable Markov chain model is developed to evaluate various mammography screening policies in terms of the expected QALYs and lifetime breast cancer mortality risk. This problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov chain because the women's true health states are not outwardly observable due to the imperfect nature of mammography screening tests.

The model takes into account two methods of detection: screening mammography and self-detection (SD), i.e., breast self-examination. Interval cancer detection is considered separately from self-detection, depending on the time interval between the detection and the last mammogram. The detailed mammography screening process is presented in Fig. 1
                      and is described as follows.

At epoch t if a mammogram is recommended, a woman may undergo the recommended mammogram with probability q(t) or skip it with probability 
                        
                           1
                           −
                           q
                           (
                           t
                           )
                           .
                        
                      If she undergoes the prescribed mammogram, she may receive a positive or negative result. After a positive result, since mammography is not perfect and has a relatively low sensitivity (the probability of receiving true positive result), a breast biopsy test is usually conducted to check the suspicious area found on a mammogram and see whether the result is true positive or not. Biopsy is assumed to be perfect since it has a relatively high sensitivity and specificity (probability of receiving true negative) rates (Parker et al., 1994). If the biopsy result is negative suggesting a false positive mammogram, the patient proceeds to the next epoch. However, if the biopsy confirms the mammographic findings, cancer is detected and the patient leaves the model. We do not model the treatment explicitly. Instead, we assume that when the patient is diagnosed with breast cancer, regardless of the method of detection, she receives a terminal (lump sum) reward and leaves the model. After a negative result, the woman proceeds to the next epoch. However, it is possible that after a negative result the cancer becomes symptomatic and be detected (interval cancer detection in this case).

If the woman skips the recommended mammogram or the recommended action at time t is to wait, she may or may not develop some symptoms suggesting there is cancer present. If she develops symptoms, depending on the action in the previous epoch we have either a self-detection (if the previous action is a wait), or an interval cancer (if the previous action is a mammogram). Note that the interval between two decision epochs in the process is six months. Therefore, if the action in a previous epoch was a mammogram and symptoms occur after the current epoch, we have an interval cancer and not a self-detection. We assume that when the woman feels a lump in her breast (symptom) she would go for a mammogram, and if the result of the mammogram is positive, she would have a biopsy test to confirm that the cancer is present. If both the mammography and biopsy tests are positive, similar to the previous case the patient leaves the model. However, if the follow-up tests (i.e., mammogram or biopsy) are negative, the patient proceeds to the next epoch.

For consistency, we refer to the woman as the “patient,” irrespective of her health condition.

                                        We consider the earliest and latest age a policy may recommend a patient undergo a mammogram to be 40 and 100, respectively. The start age of 40 is considered in order to be consistent with the current mammography screening policies (e.g. ACS). In addition, we assume the process ends at age 100 because of the negligible probability of surviving after this age according to the U.S. life tables (Arias, Heron, & Tejada-Vera, 2012). Mammography decisions are made every six months. Patients enter the process at age 40 (

                                       . The five states considered in the model are cancer free (state 0), early breast cancer (state 1), advanced breast cancer (state 2), death from breast cancer (state 3), and death from other causes (state 4). We define cancer states similarly to Maillart et al. (2008). States 0 through 2 are partially observable due to the imperfect nature of mammography tests. However, states 3 and 4 are fully observable.

                                    The total expected reward when a patient is in cancer state s in the case of interval cancer or when the cancer is diagnosed via self-detection. Different total expected reward values are considered for screen-detected and symptomatic cancers since previous studies have shown a systematic survival benefit for screen-detected cancers comparing to symptomatic cancers (Wishart et al., 2008). However, the expected rewards for interval cancers and self-detected cancers are assumed to be the same, as it has been shown that there is no statistical difference in survival between interval cancers and clinical cancers (Frisell, Von Rosen, Wiege, Nilsson, & Goldman, 1992).

The state transition diagram of the underlying Markov chain representing the disease natural history is presented in Fig. 2
                     . Note that cancer death only occurs when the cancer progresses to an advanced stage (Maillart et al., 2008).

The policies are evaluated and compared in terms of two outcome measures: total expected quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime mortality risk of breast cancer.

The value functions of policy d in our model follows a randomized Markov model in which the actions are chosen under uncertainty, i.e., at age t the woman may take action M (mammogram) with probability q(t) or choose to skip a mammogram (W) with probability

Time indices are dropped for clarity. The first line in Eq. (3a) represents the case when the patient undergoes a prescribed mammogram, receives a negative result and does not develop any symptoms within six months of the mammogram test. The second and third lines both represent the case when the recommended action is to wait in the current epoch. However, the second line is when the action at epoch

                         is a mammogram. These two cases need to be considered separately since the third case represents an interval cancer rather than self-detection because of the negative results in the previous mammogram at epoch

The logic of Eq. (2) is as follows. When a patient undergoes a mammogram, she either receives a positive or a negative result. If the patient is in the cancer free state and she receives a negative result, an immediate reward is calculated and the patient will transit to time t + 1. If the patient is in cancer states but she receives a negative result, then she may develop some symptoms with probability

                         before the next epoch, which results in cancer detection. In this case, interval cancer is identified and the patient receives the lump sum reward and leaves the model. We assume that interval cancer can only occur in cancer states since even the fastest growing cancers cannot grow from a single cell to a symptomatic size within six months (Chen, Duffy, & Tabar, 1996), which is the interval between two subsequent epochs in our model. If the patient does not develop any symptoms, she stays in the model and transits to time t + 1. If the woman is in the cancer free state and she receives a positive result, her true health state will be determined via a follow-up biopsy and she remains in the model. However, if she is in any of the two cancer states and receives a positive result, she will receive a lump sum reward and the process is terminated.

If the screening policy does not recommend a mammogram at time t, then the expected QALYs is calculated as

A wide range of routine screening policies and two-phase policies (with changing screening intervals) are evaluated in this section. Policies are defined as a quintuple (starting age, first screening interval, switching age, second screening interval, stopping age). For example, policy (40,1,50,2,80) represents a policy that recommends women start getting mammograms at age 40 and undergo the screening test every year up to age 50 and then undergo mammogram every 2 years up to age 80. Another example for routine screening policy would be (50,1,n,n,100) that recommends women undergo annual screenings from age 50 to 100. Table 1 provides polices considered in the analysis. The earliest screening start age considered is 40 since it is the earliest age among the current screening guidelines. We also include the USPSTF policy and no mammogram policy in our analysis. In total we evaluate 362 policies. Note that the numerical examples presented in this section do not include six-month policies (i.e., screening every six month) because the data source for estimating patient adherence discussed in Section 3.1 does not include six-month policies. However, the six-month decision epoch in our model formulation allows better representation of disease natural progression. The readers can evaluate more policies of interest if they have data for estimating patient adherence behaviors. Different adherence cases are also presented as numerical examples in this section.

A patient's level of adherence can be approximated based on her personal attributes such as socio-demographic, health, behavioral and knowledge related characteristics (Madadi, Zhang, Yeary, & Henderson, 2013; Murabito et al., 2001; Schonberg, McCarthy, York, Davis, & Marcantonio, 2007). We use an extension of our previous work (Madadi et al., 2014) to derive (screening) interval-dependent age-specific adherence probabilities of a patient based on her various characteristics such as race, family history, perception of chance of breast cancer, etc. Three different adherence cases are evaluated in this study: a specific woman, the general population, and a perfect adherence case. Adherence probabilities for these three cases are extracted using design-based logistic regression applied on the 2003 Health Information National Trend Survey (HINTS) data. The HINTS data support our assumption that adherence probability is dependent on (and increasing in) the interval between two subsequent prescribed mammograms. The three adherence cases considered in this study are:
                        
                           
                              (1)
                              A white unemployed woman who is not married and does not have a family history of breast cancer and believes she has a low chance of developing breast cancer. This case represents very low adherence.

The general population. This case represents the average adherence rate of the U.S. population derived from the HINTS data, which is a nationally-representative stratified survey. For this case we adjust our logistic regression model for patients’ ages.

Perfect adherence for which a patient adheres to a prescribed mammogram test with certainty.


                        Table 2 shows the confidence intervals of adherence probabilities for the general population (Case 2). These results are consistent with the CDC report for 2-year interval between 2008 and 2010 (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). As expected, adherence probabilities are increasing in age until late 60s and then start to decrease. This decrease can be related to morbidity and aging associated diseases in older ages. Adherence probabilities for Case 1 are significantly lower than those of Case 2. For 1-year screening interval, the highest adherence probabilities appear in ages 65–69 (confidence interval (0.0581, 0.2226)), with lowest in ages 40–44 (confidence interval (0.0240, 0.0906)). Adherence is only slightly better for 2-year and 3-year screening intervals. Summary of these numbers is omitted for brevity.

Initial belief states (risks of early and invasive cancers) for women aged 40 are estimated using the Gail model (National Cancer Institute, 2014). The Gail model estimates the invasive breast cancer risk for an individual based on some risk factors such as age, age at menarche, age at first live birth, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, etc. To estimate the in situ cancer risk, Gail et al. (1999) proposed using the incidence ratio between in situ and invasive cancers. For example, for average population, the initial risk of early and advanced cancer at age 40 is 0.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. For the policies with start age greater than 40, the initial belief states are updated using the belief states for women at age 40, and Eqs. (3a) and (3b).


                        Table 3 presents the data source for our numerical analyses. To specify the post-cancer life expectancies we use age-specific mortality rates for patients under cancer treatment from the SEER data (Jemal et al., 2009) based on the method described in Arias et al. (2012). To adjust the life expectancies for symptomatic cancers, we use the relative hazard rates presented in (Wishart et al., 2008).

                         is determined using the half-cycle correction method (Sonnenberg & Beck, 1993) which assigns 0.5 (six months) life years if the patient is alive in the current decision epoch and 0.25 life years if the patient dies in the current decision epoch. The immediate rewards for the other cases are calculated using Eqs. (5) and the numbers reported in Stout et al. (2006).

                        Table 4 presents the top five policies for the three different adherence cases in terms of QALYs. It also presents the associated lifetime breast cancer mortality risk for each policy.
                        
                     

The best policies for both Case 1 and the general population include the ACS policy. However, Case 1 has lower QALYs and higher breast cancer mortality risk comparing to the general population due to lower adherence probabilities. The best policies for the perfectly adherent case, however, does not include the ACS policy and prescribe less frequent mammograms (2 year interval) at older ages. For very frequent policies (e.g., the ACS), the imperfect adherence cases benefit more. Note that the USPSTF policy is not among the best policies for any of the adherence cases presented above.

Evaluation of the impact of adherence behavior on the outcomes of a specific screening policy shows that higher adherent women always have lower breast cancer mortality risk. However, this does not apply to the QALYs; for some policies Case 2 with imperfect adherence behavior has higher QALYs than perfect adherent women (Case 3). Let Δij denote the percent of QALYs a woman in the adherence Case i (=1,2) loses due to her imperfect adherence to the prescribed screening policy j, i.e.,

                        where QALY3j is the QALYs of policy j for Case 3, a perfectly adherent woman. Fig. 3 shows 29 policies that have negative losses, implying that women with average adherence as the general population (Case 2) benefit more than perfectly adherent women. Note that for all the policies considered in this study, Case 1 always has the lowest QALYs and thus positive values of Δij for all policies.

The five best policies in terms of lifetime breast cancer mortality risk, interestingly, are the same. These policies are presented in Table 5. Note that the calculated breast cancer mortality presented here are very close to the CDC estimate of 1 in 37 women (∼0.027) (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). Unlike the first objective function (QALYs), the breast cancer lifetime mortality risk has a straightforward relation to the expected number of prescribed mammograms and the expected number of actual mammograms the woman undergoes. In other words, policies with more frequent mammograms decrease the risk of dying from breast cancer. The results show that among the adherence cases presented here, Case 3 (perfect adherent women) benefits the most and has the lowest risk of dying from breast cancer. This implies that, although exposure to mammography X-ray may increase women's risk of developing breast cancer, on average it is not strong enough to affect the benefits of mammography examination in deceasing breast cancer lifetime mortality risk. This is in line with a previous study on estimating the risk of radiation-induced breast cancer following exposure of the breast to ionizing radiation occurring during mammography tests (Yaffe & Mainprize, 2011).


                        Table 6 presents the results for policies in general practice and no mammography policy for the three adherence cases.

As the results in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 suggest, there is a tradeoff between the two objective functions. Fig. 4 provides all policies (excluding “no mammogram” policy) along with the lists of efficient policies for each adherence cases. The efficient policies, ACS and USPSTF policies are highlighted in Fig. 4. The screening starting age for all efficient policies (except for the perfect adherence case) is 40. It is in contrary to the earlier study (Moss, 2004) in which the author argues that the benefits for women younger than 50 are less certain because of the lower incidence of the disease. However, since disease progression rate is higher and the cancer sojourn time is shorter in women younger than 50, benefits of getting screened before age 50 is justifiable (Shen & Zelen, 2001).

The current ACS policy (listed in bold in Fig. 4) is only efficient for Case 1 and Case 2. For perfect adherence case, efficient frontier policies are similar to the ACS with one year interval between subsequent tests but smaller ending age. Note that, the USPSTF policy and other policies in general practice (for which the associated QALYs and breast cancer lifetime mortality risk are presented in Table 6) are not among the efficient policies for any of the adherence groups.

It can be seen that there are more efficient policies for the perfect adherence case compared to the other two cases. This occurs because of the tradeoff between the two objective functions. For the perfect adherence case, the first objective (QALYs) requires less frequent mammograms due to the disutility of mammogram tests and perfect compliance of this case with the prescribed policies. On the other hand, the second objective (lifetime breast cancer mortality risk) requires more frequent mammography tests to have a lower risk of dying from breast cancer. Therefore, for this case the efficient policies are more spread out. For the other two adherence cases, since women are more likely to skip a prescribed mammogram, the first objective requires more frequent mammograms (every year) to compensate for the skipped mammograms. Thus, we have fewer efficient policies for these cases.

The tradeoff plots presented in Fig. 4 are more spread for the perfect adherence case and gets denser and less spread as the adherence level decreases. This happens because as the adherence level decreases, policies converge to “no mammogram” policy with associated QALYs and lifetime breast cancer mortality risk of 37.0142 and 0.0527, respectively.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Current screening mammography guidelines assume that women's compliance with the recommendations is perfect, i.e., women undergo their mammograms as prescribed by their physicians/health providers. However, this is not the case in reality. Women skip mammograms for different reasons. This study investigates the effect of imperfect adherence for a wide range of screening mammography policies. Two different methods of breast cancer detection are considered: mammography examination and self-detection. We also incorporate the possibility of detecting breast cancer within 12 months after a normal mammography screening (interval cancer), and the risk of developing radiation-induced breast cancer during mammography examination. A randomized partially observable Markov chain is proposed to evaluate and compare various screening policies and current practices in terms of two important health outcomes: quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and the lifetime mortality risk of breast cancer while incorporating women's adherence behavior to mammography guidelines.

Three different adherence cases are considered, including perfect adherence and two imperfect adherence cases. The adherence probabilities for imperfect adherence cases are estimated using a woman's characteristics (e.g., age, race, marital status, perception of breast cancer risk, etc.). Our results indicate that depending on the policy under study, there is one adherence group that benefits the most in terms of QALYs. As the policies get more intense (more frequent policies), the general population case obtains higher QALYs comparing to the perfect adherence case. However, Case 1 (a specific woman), which has a very low adherence level, always has lower QALYs than the other two cases. In terms of lifetime breast cancer mortality risk, higher adherence cases experience lower mortality risk for all policies. A set of efficient frontier policies are extracted for different adherence cases. The ACS policy was among the efficient frontier policies for the two imperfect cases, but not for the perfect adherence case. Comparing efficient frontier policies for different adherence cases indicates that on average women with higher level of adherence experience higher QALYs, lower lifetime breast cancer mortality risk and longer interval between two subsequent prescribed mammograms.

The results of this study along with the authors’ previous work (Madadi et al., 2014) can help physicians/health providers to tailor screening mammography recommendations based on their patient's estimated adherence likelihood. In other words, based on the patient characteristics and estimated adherence level, physicians can decide if they should shorten or lengthen the interval between two subsequent mammograms.

The direction for our future research is to incorporate the risk behavior of the decision maker and explore how different risk attitudes (risk averse, risk seeking) along with adherence behavior may affect a policy's efficiency. In this study, our purpose is to evaluate the impact of adherence on patient outcomes. Another possible direction is to optimally find a screening policy based on the patient estimated adherence behavior. It seems that screening adherence may be a function of a woman's screening history; i.e., a woman with better screening history are more likely to adhere to the current screening recommendation. Although our study considers the screening history in estimating adherence probabilities based on a survey data, it does not incorporate the dynamic feature of this factor. In addition, adherence strongly depends on a patient's experience in her previous screenings (e.g., false positives). We do not include these factors in our study due to lack of data with regard to these characteristics.
