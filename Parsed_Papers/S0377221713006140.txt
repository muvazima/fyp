                  We consider a new problem of constructing some required structures in digraphs, where all arcs installed in such required structures are supposed to be cut from some pieces of a specific material of length L. Formally, we consider the model: a digraph D
                     =(V, A; w), a structure S and a specific material of length L, where w: A
                     →
                     R
                     +, we are asked to construct a subdigraph D′ from D, having the structure S, such that each arc in D′ is constructed by a part of a piece or/and some whole pieces of such a specific material, the objective is to minimize the number of pieces of such a specific material to construct all arcs in D′.
                  For the two required structures: (1) a directed path from a node s to a node t and (2) a strongly connected spanning subdigraph, we design four approximation algorithms with constant performance ratios to solve the both problems, respectively.
               
            

The shortest path problem and the minimum-cost strongly connected spanning subdigraph problem are two well-known combinatorial optimization problems in digraphs (also referred to networks), they have played important roles with many applications in some domains, such as information dissemination networks, electronic power transportation networks, fiber optic networks, Quality of Service (QoS) routing in high-speed networks, and there are many polynomial-time algorithms or approximation algorithms to solve these two problems and other related NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (Papadimitriou & Steiglitz, 1998; Schrijver, 2003).

Related to the shortest path problem, Hassin (1992) studied the constrained shortest path problem (CSP, for short) as follows. Let D
                     =(V, A; c; d) be a digraph with n nodes, m arcs, and two fixed nodes s and t. Each arc (v
                     
                        i
                     , v
                     
                        j
                     )∈
                     A has an associated positive integral cost c
                     
                        ij
                      and a positive integral dissemination delay d
                     
                        ij
                     . For any path P
                     
                        s,t
                      from s to t in D (simply, s–t path P
                     
                        s,t
                     ), the cost c(P
                     
                        s,t
                     ) and dissemination delay d(P
                     
                        s,t
                     ) of P
                     
                        s,t
                      are defined as the sums of the costs and dissemination delays of all arcs on P
                     
                        s,t
                     , respectively. The CSP problem is asked to find a minimum-cost s–t path P
                     
                        s,t
                      in D such that dissemination delay d(P
                     
                        s,t
                     ) along this path does not exceed a given bound d
                     ∗, i.e., the value c(P
                     
                        s,t
                     ) is minimized among all paths Q
                     
                        s,t
                      from s to t, satisfying the constraint d(Q
                     
                        s,t
                     )⩽
                     d
                     ∗.

Although there are many polynomial-time algorithms to solve the shortest path problem (Papadimitriou & Steiglitz, 1998; Schrijver, 2003), the CSP problem is one NP-hard problem in Garey and Johnson (1979), and there are some approximation algorithms to solve the CSP problem, including some fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTAS, for short) for its special versions (Ergun, Sinha, & Zhang, 2002; Hassin, 1992; Warburton, 1987).

The CSP problem concerns two weight functions on the arc-sets in digraphs, but there are no relationships between such two different weight functions. For the version where there is a potential relationship between these two weight functions on the arc-sets in digraphs, Li, Li, and Lichen (2012) considered the subdivision-constrained routing requests problem (SCRR, for short), which is at least as hard as the set cover problem in Garey and Johnson (1979) even if all requests have the same source, then the authors designed a dynamic programming algorithm to find a path from a node s to other node t with total length no more than the given positive constant d
                     ∗ such that the number of the nodes uniformly inserted on such a path is minimized. A similar problem is the directed Steiner network problem (DSN, for short) studied by Chekuri, Even, Gupta, and Segev (2011), and they recently designed an 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              
                                 k
                              
                              
                                 1
                                 /
                                 2

                                 ∊
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     -approximation algorithm to solve the DSN problem, where k is the number of distinct source-sink requests in any instance of the DSN problem.

Another interesting problem studied by Lin and Xue (1999) and then by Chen et al. (2000) is the Steiner tree problem with minimum number of Steiner points (STP-MSP, for short), which is to find a Steiner tree interconnecting all k terminals with the minimum number of Steiner points such that each edge in the Steiner tree constructed has its Euclidean length no more than the given positive constant l, where k terminals are first placed in the Euclidean plane. The STP-MSP problem has an important application in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical network design. After Lin and Xue (1999) designed an 4-approximation algorithm to solve the STP-MSP problem, Chen et al. (2000) presented an 3-approximation algorithm to solve the STP-MSP problem and a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for some special versions.

In the real-world, certain specific material used to construct all edges in such a Steiner tree is sold only in length constraint, i.e., each piece of such a specific material has a finite length L (l
                     ⩽
                     L). When we assume that the price of each piece of a specific material of length L is a constant, we should consider the minimum cost (equivalently, the minimum number) of pieces of such a specific material to construct all edges in a Steiner tree, rather than the minimum of the sum of lengths of all edges in a Steiner tree.

Moreover, when we want to construct some required structures in digraphs, as well as a Steiner tree structure in the Euclidean plane, we should consider the general version where the lengths of some arcs in such structures may be greater than the length L. Now, we can use two steps to execute this construction process: (1) if an arc (u, v) in such a structure has length w(u, v) less than L, we must use a part, having length w(u, v), of a piece of such a specific material to construct the arc (u, v); (2) if an arc (u, v) in such a structure has length w(u, v) greater or equal to L, we first use I(u, v) whole pieces of such a material of length L and then a part, having length w(u, v)−
                     I(u, v)·
                     L, of such a specific material together to construct the arc (u, v), where 
                        
                           I
                           (
                           u
                           ,
                           v
                           )
                           =
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          w
                                          (
                                          u
                                          ,
                                          v
                                          )
                                       
                                       
                                          L
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                           -
                           1
                        
                     . By using this construction process, for each arc (u, v) in such a structure, we only permit this arc (u, v) to have a part with length less than L and then other I(u, v) whole pieces of such a specific material (if needing), and we may not consider any cost to patch all parts together to construct the arc (u, v) in this text. Thus, it is naturally asked how many pieces of such a specific material of length L can be used necessarily to construct all arcs in such a required structure? i.e., what is the minimum number of pieces of such a specific material of length L used in the construction process?

Motivated by the preceding combinatorial optimization problems, especially by the STP-MSP problem, the SCRR problem and the DSN problem, we study a new problem of constructing some required structures in digraphs, that is formally defined as follows: a digraph D
                     =(V, A; w), a structure 
                        
                           S
                        
                      and a specific material of length L, where a length function w: A
                     →
                     R
                     +, we are asked to construct a subdigraph D′ from D, having the structure 
                        
                           S
                        
                     , such that each arc in D′ is constructed by a part of a piece or/and some whole pieces of such a specific material of length L, the objective is to minimize the number of pieces of such a specific material to construct all arcs in D′.

For different structures 
                        
                           S
                        
                     , we may design some approximation algorithms to construct different subdigraphs D′ from D, where the construction process for arcs in each required structure is described in the preceding paragraph. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to consider this new model, and there are no approximation algorithms for this general problem and no polynomial-time algorithms to solve its special versions. This new model would have many applications in some domains.

In this paper, we consider the following two structures required as subdigraphs. (1) When a structure 
                        
                           S
                        
                      is as a directed path from a node s to another node t, we denote this problem as the constructing directed path problem (CDP, for short); (2) When a structure 
                        
                           S
                        
                      is a strongly connected spanning subdigraph, we denote this problem as the constructing strongly connected spanning subdigraph problem (CSCSS, for short). The objective is to minimize the number of pieces of such a specific material of length L to construct all arcs in the structure, defined as (1) or (2), respectively.

Since these two problems raise from the real-world, it needs some new strategy and methods to solve them. For these two structures from the special digraphs, such as either a simple directed path on n
                     +1 nodes or a simple directed cycle on n nodes, where each arc in such a simple special digraph has its length weight w(e)⩽
                     L, each of the CDP problem and the CSCSS problem becomes the bin-packing problem in Garey and Johnson (1979), which imply that these two problems cannot be approximated within performance ratio 
                        
                           
                              
                                 3
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           -
                           ε
                        
                      for any ε
                     >0, unless

                     , by the inapproximability of the bin-packing problem (Vazirani, 2001). Thus, we will design some approximation algorithms to solve them, respectively.

In this paper, we obtain the two main results: (1) We design an 2-approximation algorithm and an asymptotic

In order to clearly describe our algorithms designed in Section 3 to solve these two problems, we need some notations and terminology similar to the bin-packing problem in Coffman, Garey, and Johnson (1996), Garey and Johnson (1979), and Simchi-Levi (1994). For convenience, we may treat each piece of such a specific material of length L as a “bin” with capacity L, and when we consider an arc (u, v) in a digraph D, we may treat this arc (u, v) as an “item” of size w(u, v), and we denote 
                        
                           I
                           (
                           u
                           ,
                           v
                           )
                           =
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          w
                                          (
                                          u
                                          ,
                                          v
                                          )
                                       
                                       
                                          L

                      and w′(u, v)=
                     w(u, v)−
                     I(u, v)·
                     L. As the preceding construction process in Section 1, for each arc (u, v) having length weight w(e), we may first use I(u, v) whole pieces of such a material of length L and then “tailor” a part with length w′(u, v) from a piece of such a specific material, implying that we use I(u, v) whole pieces and a part with length w′(u, v) from a piece of such a specific material together to construct the arc (u, v) in the structure, we may treat this process as “either this arc (u, v) with weight w(u, v) or the item of size w(u, v) is ‘packed’ into some bin(s) with capacity L”, i.e., we may “pack” the item of size w(u, v) into some bin(s) with capacity L. Moreover, we also denote two notations, by D
                     =(V, A; w; L; s, t) and D
                     =(V, A; w; L), to represent an instance of the CDP problem and the CSCSS problem, respectively. The other notations and terminology not defined can be found in Ergun et al. (2002), Papadimitriou and Steiglitz (1998), Schrijver (2003), and Warburton (1987).

In Section 3, we shall present some strategy and methods to design four (asymptotic) approximations algorithms with constant performance ratios to solve these two problems, respectively; and we provide our conclusions and future work in the last section.

The strategy to solve these two problems are roughly in the following steps: (1) if needing, modify the original weights of all arcs in digraphs as some new weights; (2) use some efficient algorithms to construct the structures required, depending on the new weights; (3) finally “pack” these arcs of the structures into some bins with capacity L, corresponding to the original weights in digraphs.

The strategy and approximations algorithms in detail for these two problems are stated in the following subsections, respectively.

For convenience, to avoid lengthy formulations of our main theorems in the sequel, we first present some notations. For any digraph D
                     =(V, A; w) as an instance of the our problem indicated in the formulations of main theorems, we denote OUT as the number of necessary pieces of such a specific material to construct all arcs in the structure produced by our algorithm designed, OPT as the minimum number of necessary pieces of such a specific material to construct all arcs in the structure required, n and m as the numbers of the nodes and the arcs of the instance D, respectively.

In this subsection, we study the constructing directed path problem (CDP). Since the CDP problem cannot be approximated within performance ratio

This shows that the bound of performance ratio in the Algorithm 3.1 is asymptotically tight.

This establishes the conclusion of the theorem.□

In the remainder of this subsection, we present a new approximation algorithm to solve the CDP problem, which would be asymptotically better than the algorithm CDP-1.

Similar as in the algorithm CDP-1, for each arc e

                        L, and we refer w′(e) as the relative weight of the arc e
                        =(u, v). For convenience, if an arc e
                        =(u, v) in D satisfies

                        =(u, v) as a relative large item, simply as a large item, otherwise we denote θ(e)=0 and refer it as a relative small item, simply as a small item. The strategy to our new approximation algorithm is executed in the following steps: (1) for each arc e
                        =(u, v) in D, we redefine a new weight according to its original weight; (2) we use an optimal algorithm to construct a shortest s–t directed path P
                        
                           s,t
                        , corresponding to the new weight function; (3) sort the relative weights of arcs in the s–t directed path P
                        
                           s,t
                         in decreasing order of sizes, and then pack these items with the original sizes into some bins with capacity L.

Before we describe our new approximation algorithm to solve the CDP problem, we use an

We may propose the following conjecture for the constructing directed path problem.

In this subsection, we study the constructing strongly connected spanning subdigraph problem (CSCSS) which is defined in Section 1. It is easy to see that the CSCSS problem is a generalization of the bin-packing problem, then it cannot be approximated within performance ratio

                              -
                              ε
                           
                         for any ε
                        >0, unless 
                           
                              P
                              =
                              NP
                           
                        , by the inapproximability of the bin-packing problem in Vazirani (2001).

Moreover, we can obtain a following stronger conclusion indicated as Theorem 3.3, and then we present an 4-approximation algorithm and an asymptotic

                              0, there is no approximation algorithm within performance ratio 2–ε for the CSCSS problem, unless

                              .
                           

Suppose that there were such an approximation algorithm

                               within performance ratio 2–ε for the CSCSS problem, i.e., for any instance D
                              =(V, A; w; L) of the CSCSS problem, the algorithm 
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                               would produce a feasible solution with value OUT to satisfy the inequality OUT
                              ⩽(2–ε)OPT, where OPT is the optimal value, then we would show in polynomial time how to use the algorithm 
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                               to solve the minimum-cost strongly connected spanning subdigraph problem (MCSCSS, for short), but the MCSCSS problem is one well-known NP-hard problem in Garey and Johnson (1979), a contradiction.

Conversely, if the instance

                               (here L′=
                              L), i.e., the instance 
                                 
                                    I

By using the preceding claim, when the output OUT to the instance 
                                 
                                    τ

                               of the CSCSS problem satisfies OUT
                              =1, then the MCSCSS problem has an answer ‘yes’, and otherwise the MCSCSS problem has an answer ‘no’, thus the algorithm 
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                               solves the MCSCSS problem in polynomial time, but the MCSCSS problem is one well-known NP-hard problem in Garey and Johnson (1979), a contradiction, unless 
                                 
                                    P
                                    =

                              .

This establishes the conclusion of the theorem.□

By the fact that Frederickson and Jaja (1981) designed an 2-approximation algorithm (referred as the SCA algorithm, for short) for the strong connectivity augmentation problem, the strategy to solve the CSCSS problem is simply executed as follows: (1) Use the SCA algorithm (Frederickson and Jaja, 1981) to compute a strongly connected spanning subdigraph D′ from D, having total weight as less as possible; (2) use the FF algorithm (Coffman et al., 1996) to pack the items of all arcs in D′ into some bins with capacity L. The approximation algorithm for the CSCSS problem is described as follows.

We present two comments as follows: (1) Melkonian and Tardos (2005) designed an 3-approximation algorithm to solve the directed network design problem, which is a generalization of the MCSCSS problem as same as the strong connectivity augmentation problem in Frederickson and Jaja (1981), Melkonian and Tardos (2005) presented a worst-case example in the same paper to show that their primal–dual output is only 2−2/n times more expensive than the optimum, they also proposed a conjecture that 2−2/n is the real performance ratio, their computational results indeed support this conjecture, and they finally presented another example to show that the branchings algorithm delivers a solution to have exactly twice more expensive than the optimum; (2) we have indeed found an

                        -approximation algorithm due to Vetta (2001) to solve the special case of the MCSCSS problem, where all arcs have the same weight in the instance, and if the Vetta’s algorithm can be extended to solve the MCSCSS problem in general version, our approximation algorithm CSCSS-1 for the CSCSS problem would admit performance ratio 3, where the proof is the same as that in Theorem 3.3.

In the reminder of this subsection, we design a new approximation algorithm to solve the CSCSS problem in the following algorithmic structure form, which is asymptotically better than the Algorithm 3.3.

The strategy to our new approximation algorithm is executed as follow: (1) for each arc e in D, redefine a new weight w″(e) according to its relative weight w′(e); (2) depending on the new weight function w″(·), compute a strongly connected spanning subdigraph D′ from D with total weight as less as possible; (3) use the FFD algorithm (Simchi-Levi, 1994) to pack the items of w′(e) of all arcs of D′ into some bins with capacity L. The approximation algorithm for the CSCSS problem is described as follows.

As the similar arguments to the proof of Theorem 5.6, it is easy to see that the running time of the Algorithm 3.4 is 
                                 
                                    O

                                          n
                                       
                                       
                                          2
                                       
                                    
                                    )
                                 
                              .

This establishes the conclusion of the theorem.□

We present a comment as follows: if we can design a better α-approximation algorithm to solve the MCSCSS problem, then our Algorithm 3.4 (CSCSS-2) would be an asymptotic

At the end of this section, similar to Conjecture 3.1, we may propose the following conjecture for the CSCSS problem.

                              The CSCSS problem would admit an (asymptotic)

                                          2
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                              -approximation algorithm to solve it, where α is the performance ratio of an approximation algorithm for the MCSCSS problem.
                           

In this paper, by considering the constructing directed path problem (CDP) and the constructing strongly connected spanning subdigraph problem (CSCSS), we obtain the two main results: (1) We design an 2-approximation algorithm and an asymptotic

                     -approximation algorithm to solve the CDP problem; (2) For any ε
                     >0, we prove that there is no approximation algorithm within performance ratio 2–ε for the CSCSS problem, unless 
                        
                           P
                           =

                     , and then we present an 4-approximation algorithm and an asymptotic

                     -approximation algorithm to solve the CSCSS problem.

For further research, we shall study other optimization problems where some structures are different from the two preceding structures. The most challenging study is to design an (asymptotic)
