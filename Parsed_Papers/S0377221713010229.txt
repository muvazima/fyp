                  In this research, multistage one-shot decision making under uncertainty is studied. In such a decision problem, a decision maker has one and only one chance to make a decision at each stage with possibilistic information. Based on the one-shot decision theory, approaches to multistage one-shot decision making are proposed. In the proposed approach, a decision maker chooses one state amongst all the states according to his/her attitude about satisfaction and possibility at each stage. The payoff at each stage is associated with the focus points at the succeeding stages. Based on the selected states (focus points), the sequence of optimal decisions is determined by dynamic programming. The proposed method is a fundamental alternative for multistage decision making under uncertainty because it is scenario-based instead of lottery-based as in the other existing methods. The one-shot optimal stopping problem is analyzed where a decision maker has only one chance to determine stopping or continuing at each stage. The theoretical results have been obtained.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Decision theories under uncertainty are theories of choice under uncertainty, where the objects of choice are probability distributions for expected utility theory, subjective expected utility theory and their varieties, or prospects framed in terms of gains and losses for prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), or possibility distributions regarded as possibilistic lotteries (Dubois, Prade, & Sabbadin, 2001). However, all of these theories are lottery-based theories which generally follow the Bernoullian framework of the weighted average.

One-shot (one-time) decision is typical for situations where a decision maker has one and only one chance to make a decision with partially known information. Let us begin with a real example of one-shot decision problems. The Great Sichuan Earthquake occurred at 14:28:01 CST on May 12, 2008. Official figures stated that 69,197 people were confirmed dead. Amongst many problems caused by the earthquake, Tangjiashan Lake particularly drew the attention of the world because it was seriously threatening the lives of 1,300,000 people, the Lanchengyu Oil Pipeline and the Chengbao Railway (one of the arterial railways in China). To prevent damage to the dam, the water in the lake needed to be drained away as soon as possible by building a sluice channel. There were only two alternatives for building a sluice channel: using explosives or digging by excavators. It was a one-shot decision to decide which method should be utilized in the face of the uncertainties from rain, aftershock, dam stability, land slip and time. Other examples of one-shot decision problems include the individual real estate investment (Guo, 2010b), the medical treatment choice of a person with a life-threatening illness, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and other decision-analysis projects in enterprises (Clemen & Kwit, 2001). One-shot decision problems are commonly encountered in business, economics, and social systems.


                     Guo (2011) initially proposed the one-shot decision theory for dealing with one-shot decision problems. The one-shot decision theory provides the scenario-based choice instead of the lottery-based choices as in other decision theories under uncertainty. It is enlightened by the common phenomenon that when asking a person why he/she makes such a one-shot decision with little information, he/she will most often reply one scenario, which is crucial to him/her and the basis for achieving his/her conclusion. Let us refer to an example. An article in Mainichi Japan (June 16, 2012) reported that “Japan’s government on Saturday approved bringing the country’s first nuclear reactors back online since last year’s earthquake and tsunami led to a shutdown of reactors nationwide.” Whether to restart nuclear reactors in western Japan was a typical one-shot decision problem. As mentioned in the same article, the main reason for such a decision was “demand is expected to peak in mid July or early August, so they need to begin work immediately to get the reactors up and running in time to avoid shortages.” In addition, Japan Real Time (May 18, 2012) said that without nuclear reactors the area of western Japan served by Kansai Electric had to keep power consumption between July and September to no more than 85% of peak usage during the hot summer of 2010.

According to the one-shot decision theory, a person makes a one-shot decision based on some particular scenario (state) which is the most appropriate one for him/her while considering the satisfaction level incurred by this scenario and its possibility degree. The one-shot decision process is separated into two steps. The first step is to seek an appropriate scenario from all possible states for each alternative. This scenario is called as the focus point of the alternative. The second step is to evaluate the alternatives by the satisfaction levels incurred by the focus points for obtaining the optimal alternative. Twelve kinds of focus points are proposed to characterize the different preferences of decision makers for selecting scenarios (Guo, 2011). As an application, a duopoly market of a new product with a short life cycle is analyzed where three kinds of focus points, i.e. normal, active, and passive ones are considered. Possibilistic Cournot equilibriums are obtained for different types of pairs of firms in a duopoly market. The results of analysis are quite in agreement with the situations encountered in the real business world (Guo, 2010a; Guo, Yan, & Wang, 2010). The one-shot decision theory is also applied to private real estate investment problems (Guo, 2010b). The analysis tells the relation between the amount of uncertainty and the investment scale for different types of personal investors. The proposed models provide insights into personal real estate investment decisions and important policy implications to regulate urban land development. Recently, the research (Guo, 2014) clarifies the fundamental differences between the one-shot decision theory and other decision theories under uncertainty and points out the instinct problems in other decision theories to show that the one-shot decision theory is necessary to solve one-shot decision problems and manifests the relationship between the one-shot decision theory and the probabilistic decision methods.

Multistage decisions refer to a series of interdependent decisions which are made at each stage to achieve a final result. Dynamic programming is a powerful vehicle for dealing with multistage decision-making problems (Bellman, 1957). The stochastic dynamic programming problems are used for handling multistage decision making under risk (e.g. Canakoglu & Ozekici, 2012; Chen, Ghate, & Tripathi, 2011; Cristobal, Escudero, & Monge, 2009; Flapper, Gayon, & Vercraene, 2012; Minis & Tatarakis, 2011; Shapiro, Tekaya, da Costa, & Soares, 2013). The stochastic dynamic programming problems are formulated as a maximization problem of the expected value with the assumption that the system under control is a Markov chain. Fuzzy dynamic programming problems are appropriate to deal with the ambiguity inherently existing in the human judgment for multistage decision-making problems (e.g. Kacprzyk, 1983; Kacprzyk & Esogbue, 1996; Li & Cheng, 2004; Li & Lai, 2001). Fuzzy dynamic programming problems introduce a fuzzy constraint and a fuzzy goal at each stage following Bellman and Zadeh’s framework (1970). Fuzzy dynamic programming problems are also well used for multiple objective dynamic programming problems (e.g. Abo-Sinna, 2004; Pal & Moitra, 2003). Sabbadin, Fargier, and Lang (1998) proposed the approaches to multistage decision making based on possibility and necessity measures of fuzzy events.

Optimal stopping is an important topic in multistage decision-making situations (Shiryaev, 2007). There has been a continuous and increasing interest in stopping time literature (e.g. Engelage, 2011; Karpowicz, 2009; Lempa, 2012; Mahayni & Schoenmakers, 2011). Although most research has been done in the probabilistic framework, the fuzzy stopping time was taken into account by Kacprzyk (1978) in which the termination time was given as a specified fuzzy set. Kurano, Yasuda, Nakagami, and Yoshida (2002) proposed an approach to optimal stopping for a dynamic fuzzy system with fuzzy rewards. Yoshida, Yasuda, Nakagami, and Kurano (2003) addressed stopping models for a fuzzy stochastic system.

In this research, we apply the one-shot decision theory to multistage one-shot decision problems under uncertainty. Multistage one-shot decision making is typical for such decision problems where at each stage a decision maker has one and only one chance to make a decision. We propose a general approach to multistage one-shot decision making under uncertainty. At each stage, a decision maker chooses one state for each alternative, called focus point with considering its possibility and the satisfaction level of the outcome which is associated with the chosen focus points at the succeeding stages. Based on the selected states (focus points), the sequence of optimal decisions is determined by dynamic programming.

There are other researchers who have discussed the problems similar to the problem discussed in this research. We consider a possibilistic dynamic system under control similar to the problem examined by Sabbadin et al. (1998). However, we choose the optimal alternative in completely different ways. They used the optimistic and pessimistic utilities initially proposed by Yager (1979) and Whalen (1984) and axiomatized in the style of Savage by Dubois et al. (2001) with the core assumption of a qualitative commensurability between the possibility degree and the satisfaction level. The optimistic and pessimistic utilities are possibility and necessity measures of the fuzzy event, respectively. Their methods are possibilistic lottery-based whereas our methods are scenario-based. We evaluate the alternative by the outcome caused from the occurrence of its focus point (scenario). We have twelve kinds of focus points for making a decision in order to correspond to the decision maker’s different preference for selecting his/her appropriate scenarios. When choosing active and passive focus points, our approach can be reduced to optimistic and pessimistic utilities based methods if the possibility distribution and the satisfaction function satisfy some special conditions.

This paper extends the existing literature in three important dimensions. First, a general approach to multistage one-shot decision making is proposed which extends the one-shot decision theory from the single stage to the multistage by means of dynamic programming. Second, based on the different types of focus points, we obtain twelve kinds of optimal decision paths to show which scenario at each stage is taken into account and why such a series of decisions is obtained for the twelve types of decision makers. Hence, the proposed approaches are scenario-based ones with greater appeal to intuition, simplicity of application and explicability. Third, the optimal stopping problem of the possibilistic dynamic system is theoretically analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, our research is the first in dealing with the optimal stopping problem in possibilistic dynamic systems.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The one-shot decision theory is briefly introduced in the next section. In Section 3, a general approach to multistage one-shot decision making is proposed. In Section 4, as a typical multistage decision problem, an optimal stopping problem is analyzed with the proposed decision approaches. Finally, concluding remarks are made in Section 5.

In a one-shot decision problem, the set of an alternative a is A. The set of a state x is S. The degree to which a state x is to occur in the future is characterized by a possibility distribution π(x) defined below.
                        Definition 1
                        Given a function π: S
                           →[0,1] if max
                              x∈S
                           
                           
                           π(x)=1, then π(x) is called a possibility distribution where S is the sample space. π(x) is the possibility degree of x.

The easy way to distinguish between possibility and probability is that there is not the additivity requirement for possibility. π(x)=1 means that it is normal that x occurs but does not mean that x is certain. π(x)=0 means that it is abnormal that x occurs but does not mean it absolutely does not appear. Due to the relaxation of the additivity, the possibility distribution is more feasible for the decision situation with partially known information (Guo, 2014). The methods for identifying possibility distributions based on similarity, potential surprise and voting are proposed in the papers (Guo, 2011; Guo & Tanaka, 2003; Guo et al., 2010).

The consequence resulting from the combination of an alternative a and a state x is referred to as a payoff, denoted as v(x, a). The satisfaction level of a decision maker for a payoff can be expressed by a satisfaction function, as defined below.
                        Definition 2
                        Denote the set of the payoffs obtained by an alternative a as V(a). The function u: V(a)→[0,1] is called a satisfaction function of the alternative a if it satisfies u(v
                           1)>
                           u(v
                           2) for v
                           1
                           >
                           v
                           2 where v
                           1, v
                           2
                           ∈
                           V(a) and ∃v
                           ∈
                           V(a), u(v)=1.

The satisfaction function is used to represent the relative position of the payoff obtained from an alternative by the normalizing operator. Because the payoff is the function of x and a, we can also write the satisfaction function as u(x, a).

The one-shot decision theory argues that a person makes a one-shot decision based on some particular state which is the most appropriate scenario for him/her while considering the satisfaction level incurred by it and its possibility degree. In other words, a decision maker chooses one state amongst all possible ones for each alternative. The selected state is called the focus point of this alternative. Determining the focus point depends on his/her attitude about possibility and satisfaction. Considering all combination of satisfaction and possibility, twelve types of focus points are provided to help a decision maker in finding out the states (scenarios) which are adequate for him/her. The characteristics of the twelve types of focus points are shown in Tables 1–3
                     
                     
                     . Type IX focus point seems suitable for an active decision maker whereas Type X focus point seems suitable for an apprehensive decision maker because although some scenario has a lower possibility, it is still taken into account by a decision maker as it can cause a larger loss (lower satisfaction level). Type X focus point can be used to characterize the behavior of buying insurance. Type XI focus point seems suitable for a passive decision maker whereas Type XII focus point seems suitable for a daring decision maker because even if the possibility of some scenario is lower, a higher gain (higher satisfaction level) may lure a decision maker to consider such a situation. Type XII focus point can be used to characterize the behavior of buying lottery. Next, we provide mathematical formulas to find out the aforementioned twelve types of focus points.

Type I focus point: The state (scenario) with the highest satisfaction and a high possibility to occur is obtained as

In other words, there is no state which has a higher possibility degree and a higher satisfaction level than the type IX focus point; a lower possibility degree and a lower satisfaction level than the type X focus point; a higher possibility degree and a lower satisfaction level than the type XI focus point; a lower possibility degree and a higher satisfaction level than the type XII focus point.

For one alternative, more than one state might exist as one type of focus point. We denote the sets of twelve types of focus points of the alternative a as

In a one-shot decision problem, a decision maker contemplates that the focus points are the most appropriate states (scenarios) for him/her and he/she chooses one alternative which can bring about the best consequence once the focus point (scenario) comes true. Since there are twelve types of focus points, there are twelve types of optimal alternatives, as shown below.

It should be noted that the payoff function v(x, a) is used for obtaining the optimal alternative in (13)–(24) instead of using the satisfaction function u(x, a).


                     Comments: If some alternatives yield certain outcomes, such alternatives should be separated from the alternatives which lead to uncertain results. Suppose a
                     
                        c
                      is an alternative which yields the maximum certain outcome v
                     
                        c
                     . For obtaining the optimal alternative, we should compare v
                     
                        c

                     Comments: (Guo, 2014) What are the differences between the subjective expected utility theory (SEU) and the one-shot decision theory (OSD)?
                        
                           Comparison 1: In SEU, there are two steps as follows:
                                 
                                    
                                       Step 1: Evaluating each alternative by the weighted average utility of all outcomes.


                                       Step 2: Selecting the alternative with the maximum average.

In OSD, there are two steps as follows:
                                 
                                    
                                       Step 1: Seeking a state (focus point) for each alternative.


                                       Step 2: Choosing the alternative with the maximum outcome of the focus point.

Comparison 2: In SEU, a utility function is associated with risky situations. If a person is a risk averter, the utility function is concave. If a person is a risk taker, the utility function is convex. If a person is risk neutral, the utility function is linear. In OSD, the satisfaction function has no relation with risk situations, which represents the relative position of the payoff. Which type of focus point is used for making a decision reflects the attitude of a decision maker to uncertainty.

Comparison 3: SEU uses the subjective probability to characterize the uncertainty whereas OSD utilizes the possibility distribution.

Comparison 4: SEU and OSD explain why some alternative is optimal in completely different ways. An alternative is evaluated by SEU based on the average. If the optimal alternative is repeated a large number of times, the total payoff obtained almost surely attains the maximum in the sense of the strong law of large numbers, whereas OSD gives a clear answer to why some alternative is optimal when only one decision chance is left to a decision maker.

For easily understanding how to make a decision with the one-shot decision theory, a numerical example is given below.
                        Example 1
                        The sets of alternatives and states are A

                           . For illustrative purposes, let us assume that the estimated possibility degrees of states and the satisfaction levels for three alternatives on each state are shown in Tables 5 and 6
                           
                           , respectively. We set α as 0.68 and β as 0.78 so that the states are classified into the following groups according to possibility degrees and satisfaction levels; that is, X

Let us consider multistage decision making under uncertainty. If at each stage there is one and only one chance for a decision maker to make a decision with partially known information, we call such a decision problem as a multistage one-shot decision problem. In a multistage one-shot decision problem, the length of decision periods is T. The initial decision is at stage 0, and the last decision is at stage T

                     (68) is the optimality equation in multistage one-shot decision problems. Comparing with the optimality equation in stochastic dynamic programming problems, the transition cost associated with the focus points in multistage one-shot decision problems takes the place of the expected transition cost in stochastic dynamic programming problems. Because one and only one state occurs while making a decision at each stage, (68) is reasonable for multistage one-shot decision making.
                        Definition 5
                        A dynamic possibilistic system is called a possibilistic time-invariant system if and only if the states and possibility distributions remain the same at each stage.

In a possibilistic time-invariant system with infinite discrete states {0,1,2,…}, the possibility distribution of the states associated with an alternative a can be represented by an infinite possibilistic transition matrix P
                     
                        a
                     
                     =[p
                     
                        ij
                     ]. Its entry p
                     
                        ij
                     
                     =
                     π(i, j)=
                     π(x
                     
                        t+1
                     =
                     j∣x

                     i) is the possibility degree to which the state i given now will turn into the state j at the next stage satisfying p
                     
                        ij

                     =1 for ∀i
                     ∈{0,1,2,…}. The following numerical example is used to illustrate how to make a multistage one-shot decision.

As a typical multistage decision problem under uncertainty, an optimal stopping problem involves only two possible alternatives: stopping or continuing. Solving this problem involves finding out the optimal time at which a decision maker stops a process to obtain the best “goodness”. In this section, we consider a one-shot optimal stopping problem, that is, at each stage a decision maker has one and only one chance to choose an alternative: stopping or continuing. If a decision maker chooses continuing then the process will proceed to the next step. If a decision maker chooses stopping then the process will end. Let us examine an example of an individual house-selling problem. As Kummerow (2002) mentioned, real estate assets are heterogeneous. There are hundreds of factors, such as, age, location, site/view, design/appeal, room count, gross living area and functional utility that might affect prices in various situations. Moreover, properties trade infrequently, perhaps once every 5–10years for the average house. In general there are few sales of properties similar enough to be “comparable” and probably none of identical properties. Due to lack of enough information on properties, using possibility distributions to characterize the uncertainty of the housing price is more desirable (Guo, 2010b). For an individual house owner, at each stage he/she has one and only one chance to make a decision: selling the house or waiting for a better offer. That is, he/she has to choose an optimal stopping time. This problem is a typical one-shot optimal stopping problem.

Let us examine a one-shot optimal stopping problem in a possibilistic time-invariant system with infinite discrete states {0,1,2,…}. Suppose that the reward for stopping and the cost for continuing do not depend on t. If a decision maker decides stopping at the state k, the reward for stopping is r
                     
                        k
                     . The cost associated with the transition from the state j to the state l is c
                     
                        jl
                     , j, l
                     ∈{0,1,2,…}.

Assume that we are permitted at most m further steps before stopping with the initial state j

In this example, we have T
                     2(3)=3, T
                     5(3)=2, T

                     10(3)=0, S(3)={8,10}, S(2)={10}, S(1)={10}, C(3)={2,5}, C(2)={2,5,8} and C(1)={2,5,8}. For the initial state 2, the sequence of the type IX optimal decisions is {a1,
                     a1,
                     a1} and the trajectory of the type IX focus point is 5→8→10. Interestingly, v
                     8(3)<
                     v
                     8(2) holds in this example. So that v
                     
                        i
                     (t)⩾

                     (t
                     −1) does not always hold. It means that having more stages to make a decision might not be more beneficial in the sense that the increase of decision stages can lead to much uncertainty. Such a phenomenon is well encountered in the real world.

In this research, a general approach to multistage one-shot decision making is proposed with the one-shot decision theory. At each stage a decision maker chooses one state (focus point) amongst all states according to his/her attitude about satisfaction and possibility. The optimality equation in multistage one-shot decision problems is given. Comparing with the optimality equation in stochastic dynamic programming problems, the payoff associated with the focus points in multistage one-shot decision problems takes the place of the expected payoff in stochastic dynamic programming problems. The sequence of optimal decisions is determined by the proposed backward induction. Because one and only one state occurs while making a decision at each stage, the obtained sequence of optimal decisions is reasonable for making a decision in multistage one-shot decision problems. Based on the twelve types of focus points, we obtain twelve kinds of optimal decision paths to show which scenario at each stage is taken into account and why such a series of decisions is obtained for the twelve types of decision makers. Our research is the first in dealing with the optimal stopping problem in possibilistic dynamic systems. We examine the optimal stopping problem in the possibilistic time-invariant system. The one-step look-ahead rule in the one-shot optimal stopping problem is proposed. How stopping times vary between different types of focus points and are influenced by the changes of possibility distributions and satisfaction functions is theoretically analyzed. The proposed approach is a fundamental alternative for multistage decision making under uncertainty because it is scenario-based instead of lottery-based as in the other existing methods. The research on multistage one-shot decision analysis is at an early stage. Many further researches can be done from theoretical and applied aspects. This research provides the theoretical base for the further research on multistage one-shot decision problems, which are commonly encountered in business, economics, and social systems.
