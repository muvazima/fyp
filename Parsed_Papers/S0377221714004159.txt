                  Multiobjective shortest path problems are computationally harder than single objective ones. In particular, execution time is an important limiting factor in exact multiobjective search algorithms. This paper explores the possibility of improving search performance in those cases where the interesting portion of the Pareto front can be initially bounded. We introduce a new exact label-setting algorithm that returns the subset of Pareto optimal paths that satisfy a set of lexicographic goals, or the subset that minimizes deviation from goals if these cannot be fully satisfied. Formal proofs on the correctness of the algorithm are provided. We also show that the algorithm always explores a subset of the labels explored by a full Pareto search. The algorithm is evaluated over a set of problems with three objectives, showing a performance improvement of up to several orders of magnitude as goals become more restrictive.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Goal programming is one of the most successful models of Multicriteria Decision Theory (Chankong & Haimes, 1983). Virtually hundreds of applications can be found in the literature (Romero, 1991; Tamiz, Jones, & El-Darzi, 1995). This paper explores the application of the goal-based decision paradigm to multicriteria shortest path problems.

Multicriteria shortest path problems arise naturally in many fields, such as robot surveillance (Delle Fave, Canu, Iocchi, Nardi, & Ziparo, 2009), robot path planning (Fujimura, 1996), satellite scheduling (Gabrel & Vanderpooten, 2002), and route planning in different contexts (Delling & Wagner, 2009; Clímaco, Craveirinha, & Pascoal, 2003; Jozefowiez, Semet, & Talbi, 2008; Machuca & Mandow, 2012). A number of shortest path algorithms have been proposed to tackle different multicriteria decision models. The work of Hansen (Hansen, 1979) presented a bi-objective extension of Dijkstra’s label setting algorithm. Martins (Martins, 1984) proposed a general multiobjective label setting algorithm. A recent evaluation of several multiobjective shortest path algorithms can be found in (Raith & Ehrgott, 2009).

The multiobjective shortest path problem is computationally harder than the single objective one. The number of label expansions can grow exponentially with solution depth, even for the two objective case (Hansen, 1979). With the assumption of bounded integer costs and a fixed number of objectives the problem becomes tractable for polynomially sized graphs, but still harder than single objective search (e.g. see (Mandow & Pérez de la Cruz, 2009; Müller-Hannemann & Weihe, 2006)).

Search efficiency can be improved in single destination (one to one) problems using lower bound distance estimates in a similar way as algorithm A∗ improves over Dijkstra’s (Pearl, 1984). Several multiobjective extensions of A∗ have been proposed. These can be grouped in two classes: those that perform node expansion as its basic operation (like MOA∗ (Stewart & White, 1991)), and those that perform label expansion (like Tung and Chew’s algorithm (Tung & Chew, 1992) and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 NAMOA
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                      (Mandow & Pérez de la Cruz, 2010)). The interest in these algorithms with lower bounds is justified by the fact that: precise lower bound estimates can be efficiently precalculated for a large class of problems (Tung & Chew, 1992); and the use of such estimates still guarantees an exact solution, i.e. the algorithms find the set of all Pareto optimal solutions to the problem.

Several algorithms extended the node expansion policy of MOA∗ to different contexts, like algorithms MOA∗∗ for search with nonconsistent lower bounds (Dasgupta, Chakrabarti, & DeSarkar, 1999), BCA∗ for compromise solutions (Galand & Perny, 2006), or METAL-A∗ for goal based preferences (Mandow & Pérez de la Cruz, 2001). The latter are the subject of this work. However, recent empirical and formal analyses (Machuca, Mandow, Pérez de la Cruz, & Ruiz-Sepulveda, 2012; Pérez de la Cruz, Mandow, & Machuca, 2013) have shown that lower bounded search with node expansion can perform much worse than blind search algorithms and, more precisely, that performance can seriously degrade with better lower bound estimates. In practice, this result ruins the primary purpose of using lower bounds in these algorithms in the first place.

On the other hand, label expansion algorithms with lower bounds have successfully improved performance over blind search algorithms. The efficiency of

                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                      has been formally shown to improve with better informed lower bound estimates and, in fact, it has been shown to optimally exploit such estimates among the class of admissible algorithms (Mandow & Pérez de la Cruz, 2010). Empirical results confirm that 
                        
                           
                              
                                 NAMOA
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                      performs consistently better than blind search, and that better informed lower bounds result in faster search with less space requirements (Machuca et al., 2012). Experiments on problems like bicriteria route planning reveal that time, rather than space, is the practical limiting factor in the calculation of the full Pareto set of solutions (Machuca & Mandow, 2012; Machuca, Mandow, & Pérez de la Cruz, 2009). Recent attempts to improve this algorithm include parallel search (Sanders & Mandow, 2013) and the use of specific efficient data structures (Mali, Michail, & Zaroliagis, 2012).

Many problems do not require in practice the calculation of the full Pareto optimal set of solutions. In this work we investigate the possibility of further improvements over the efficiency of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 NAMOA

                      through the introduction of lexicographic goal based preferences. A set of goals can be proposed to bound the area of interesting solutions. More precisely, given a set of goals, we tackle the problem of finding the subset of Pareto optimal paths that satisfy the goals or, if these cannot be satisfied, finding the subset of Pareto optimal paths that minimize deviation from the goals. We propose a new multicriteria label-setting algorithm with lower bounds and label expansion that finds such goal-optimal solutions. The new algorithm explores a subset of the labels explored by

                     , achieving important performance improvements.

Section 2 reviews relevant concepts from multicriteria decision theory and introduces the concept of pruning preference. Section 3 describes the algorithm. Important properties concerning admissibility and efficiency are presented in Section 4. An empirical evaluation is described and discussed in Section 5. Finally some conclusions and future work are outlined.

First of all, we review the concepts of attribute, objective, and goal, as defined in Romero (1991). Let X be the set of solutions to a decision problem. An attribute is a measurable property 
                           
                              g
                              (
                              x
                              )
                              :
                              X
                              →
                              R
                           
                        . An objective represents the desired improvement of an attribute, i.e. maximization or minimization. A goal combines an attribute with a specific target value, or aspiration level 
                           
                              t
                              ∈
                              R
                           
                        , stated by the decision maker to define his/her preference. Goals for multiobjective shortest path problems are always of the form 
                           
                              g
                              (
                              x
                              )
                              ⩽
                              t
                           
                        . Goals are not constraints, i.e. feasible solutions may not satisfy all goals.

Let us consider a set of q attributes

A solution to a goal problem is satisfactory when all the goals can be satisfied. We seek nondominated satisfactory solutions. If there are no satisfactory solutions to a problem, we seek nondominated solutions that minimize deviation from the targets. In lexicographic goal problems, the deviation of a set of goals is measured separately for each priority level. Minimizing the deviation of goals at level k is infinitely more important than minimizing deviation at level 
                           
                              k

Several methods have been proposed to measure the deviation from a set of goals. In this work, the minimization of the weighted sum of deviations is employed. Let

The algorithm has five main steps. The first one is devoted to data structure initialization. The second one is devoted to label selection from OPEN, and lazy filtering. At each iteration the algorithm selects the first label

During path expansion two different conditions may prevent an extension from consideration: filtering and pruning. These are described in detail below.

Regrettably, the optimality principle does not hold for lexicographic goal preferences, i.e. a goal-optimal path is not made of goal-optimal subpaths. The following example illustrates this fact.

                         represents another solution since t is the destination node, its cost is not dominated by any vector in COSTS and it can also satisfy all goals. Finally, in the next iteration OPEN is empty and the algorithm would search backward from t returning the solution subgraph with the two paths with costs (10,8,10) and (10,9,7).

                      with cost (10,10). However, due to the pruning rule, it will never be generated, and the dominated path with cost (10,10) will need to be expanded. In other words, the inclusion of an arbitrary pruning rule may lead to the exploration of labels never considered by

So we must formally show that the additional rules of

We extend the definition as follows: a multiobjective search algorithm with goal-based preferences is admissible if it terminates with the set of all goal-optimal solutions to the problem.

                            is a label-setting algorithm that generates partial paths from the start node to the destination. Each partial path is either expanded, filtered, or pruned. A goal-optimal solution could be pruned by pruning conditions (11) or (12) from Section 3.1, or could be filtered by filtering conditions (13) or (14) from Section 3.2. By definition, a goal-optimal solution has a nondominated cost. Since the optimality principle holds for dominated costs, neither pruning condition (11) nor filtering condition (13) will ever discard a goal-optimal solution.

The proof for condition (12) follows. Let us assume two paths

In this work we aim to improve over the efficiency of full multiobjective search, concentrating search effort on a subset of all Pareto optimal solutions. Algorithm

The nadir point is generally unknown in practice, but we take advantage of it in these experiments to obtain targets with different degrees of satisfaction for the purpose of experimentation. In a practical situation the ideal point is known thanks to the lower bound precalculations (Tung & Chew, 1992). These also provide the nadir point for two objectives, and at least an approximation for three or more objectives.

Three different classes of experiments were carried out. For the first class, five different target sets were calculated as follows,

The algorithms were implemented in Common Lisp using LispWorks Professional 6.01 (64-bit), and run on a 3gigahertz Intel Xeon X5472 with 32gigabyte of RAM, under Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit). The algorithms were implemented to share as much code as possible.

This can be explained by the fact that when goals are satisfied, values of deviation vectors of expanded labels are

                                 →
                              
                           
                        
                      and deviation pruning is barely triggered. On the other hand, unsatisfied goals cause greater deviation values and hence, a greater number of pruning opportunities. Therefore, the higher deviation from goals, the more effective deviation pruning.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Multiobjective shortest path problems are computationally harder than single objective ones. Current exact algorithms can solve moderately sized problems with two objectives, but time quickly becomes a limiting factor as the size of the graph or the number of objectives grows. This paper explores the possibility of more efficient multiobjective analysis for those cases where the interesting portion of the Pareto front can be initially bounded. In practice, the efficient calculation of cost estimates described by Tung and Chew provides important information about the problem to be searched. In particular, the ideal point and at least an estimate of the nadir point are known before actual multiobjective search takes place.

We introduce 
                        
                           
                              
                                 LEXGO
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                     , a new algorithm that returns the subset of the Pareto front defined by a set of lexicographic goal preferences. We define goal-optimal solutions as the subset of Pareto-optimal solutions that satisfy all goals or, when these cannot be satisfied, the subset of Pareto-optimal solutions that minimize deviation from the goals. Under reasonable assumptions the algorithm is formally guaranteed to return the set of goal-optimal solutions, and to explore a subset of the labels explored by 
                        
                           
                              
                                 NAMOA
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                     , the state-of-the-art multiobjective search algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated over a set of standard multiobjective problems with three objectives. As goals become more restrictive, results show a dramatic reduction of up to several orders of magnitude in the number of explored labels and execution time. In general, the improvement in performance is related to the reduction in the number of explored labels. However, in problems were goals are not satisfied, the special pruning condition developed for 
                        
                           
                              
                                 LEXGO
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                      can also have a fundamental influence in time performance.

In cases where the interesting portion of the Pareto front can be bounded, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 LEXGO
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                      can be an algorithm of choice to reduce execution time from hours to seconds, or to explore harder multiobjective problems.
