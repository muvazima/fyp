                  In this work, a spatial equilibrium problem is formulated for analyzing the impact of the application of the EU-ETS on the steel industry that has historically seen Europe as one of its major producers. The developed model allows us to simultaneously represent the interactions of several market players, to endogenously determine output and steel prices and to analyze the investment in the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. In addition, the proposed model supports the evaluation of the CO2 emission costs on the basis of Directive 2009/29/EC, the “20-20-20” targets, and the Energy Roadmap 2050. In this light, two main processes for steelmaking have to be considered: integrated mills (BOF) and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) in minimills.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) has been up and running since 2005 by Directive 2003/87/EC (now modified by Directive 2009/29/EC). The EU-ETS is the world’s first international largest cap-and-trade system and covers half of the European’s annual carbon emissions. It has helped Europe to maintain the Kyoto Protocol targets and it is noted as one of the main tools to achieve the ambitious target of 20 percent emission reductions by 2020 below 1990 levels.

The EU-ETS was initially developed in two distinct phases as indicated by Directive 2003/87/EC, but then it is being implemented in three phases trough the Directive 2009/29/EC. The first pilot phase (from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2007) was called “learning by doing” phase, in which a great autonomy was given to member states throughout the allowance allocation process in all over the involved sectors. At the end of this period, the situation led to a decrease in emission price caused by the over-allocation of free allowances and by the inability to carry forward unused allowances to Phase II. The second phase (from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012) coincides with the “first commitment period” of the Kyoto Protocol, in which the involved members must observe their emission targets under the protocol. As in the first phase, we have seen over-allocation of free emission permits, even though the Commission has decided to cut them by 6.5 percent compared to the 2005 level. We are currently in the third phase (running from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2020), in which the EU-ETS will be substantially strengthened and extended.

In this paper, we evaluate the economic impacts of the environmental regulation on the pig iron and steel sectors through a spatial equilibrium model. The importance of the study of these sectors started because Europe is a major producer of steel and the steel industry is dominated by large multinational companies. The European steel industry has become an industry operating across national borders, and it has obtained an important position in domestic markets, particularly in high-end segments. Moreover, the steel industry is affected by the increase of the electricity price (due to EU-ETS) for the high consumption of electricity in its process.

Studies that have assessed the impact of the EU ETS in this sector (see Oberndorfer et al., 2006 and references therein) generally conclude to a modest decrease in EU production. Conversely most of these studies do not address the second aspect of competitiveness, i.e., profitability, one exception being Robin Smale et al. (2006) who find a positive impact.

Various papers in the literature have studied the impact of the EU-ETS in the iron and steel sector. For example, Hidalgo et al. (2005) present a world simulation model able to analyze the evolution of the industry from 1997 to 2030, Junichiro et al. (2007) evaluate CO2 emission reduction potentials and the minimum cost of technological options in the iron and steel sector by regions across the world, while Yeonbae and Ernst (2002) analyze CO2 emissions from energy use in iron and steel industry. Differently from the previous papers, our work aims to provide a technological and economic underpinning for the development of a global roadmap for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in the steel sector. CCS is a key technology in the fight against dangerous climate change and will be instrumental in helping governments to deliver ambitious international action; it has a large role to play in this sector, because carbon is used in the steel market as a metallurgic reducing agent.

The equilibrium model allows us to analyze the market participants’ action, to determine endogenously the price of the crude steel and to understand the investment decisions in CCS infrastructure. The spatial equilibrium problem is also formulated for analyzing how the price of CO2 can influence investment decisions in the steel sector under EU-ETS. In this light, two main processes for steelmaking have to be considered: integrated mills (BOF) and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) in minimills.

We adopt a technological representation of the European market and also a representation of the Mediterranean, the Russian and the Asian steel markets.

The problem has been modeled as a nonlinear Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) with jointly convex constraints. It is well known that a GNEP can have either no solution, a unique solution, multiple solutions, or infinitely many solutions (see Facchinei et al., 2007; Facchinei and Kanzow, 2007, Facchinei and Pang, 2003 for a complete review). In this paper we guarantee the existence of an equilibrium solution. Moreover, taking into account the relationship between the solution of a GNEP and a Variational Inequality (VI) we reformulate and solve our model as a Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP), i.e. a particular instance of a VI. The MCP problem is solved in GAMS using the PATH solver.

The structural outline of this paper is as follows: in Section 2 the description of the pig iron and steel sectors is introduced. In Section 3, the equilibrium model is described where the companies are Cournot competitors. In Section 4 the mathematical background is presented, while results are discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 is devoted to the conclusions.

Currently there are two main routes to produce crude steel. The first one, the integrated steelmaking route or primary route, is based on the Blast Furnace (BF) ironmaking and Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) and uses raw material including iron ore, coal and coke, limestone and dolomite. The second one, the recycling route or secondary route, produces steel in the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) using primarily ferrous scrap as main raw material.

The integrated route is based on the iron ore reduction with the addition of reducing agents and fluxes in the BF to a high carbon primary metal, called pig iron. The main reducing agent used is coke, which is produced from coal, while fluxes involved are mainly limestone and dolomite.
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Precisely, the integrated route uses 1400 kilograms of iron ore, 770 kilograms of coal and 150 kilograms of limestone to produce a ton of crude steel, see for more details World Steel Association.
                      Iron oxides, coke, coal and fluxes react with the heated blast hair injected on the bottom of the furnace to form pig iron, carbon monoxide (CO), and slag which are periodically removed from the furnace. Then, the remaining carbon in the pig iron is oxidized in the BOF by injecting a high-purity oxygen to remove carbon as CO and CO2. Finally, the obtained product is crude steel which is an alloy with a carbon content between 0.2 percent and 2 percent by wait against the carbon content of the pig iron which is between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent.

The other main route, the EAF route, uses scrap as main input and melts it with electricity. On averages, the recycled steel-EAF route uses 880 kg of ferrous scrap, 150 kg of coal and 43 kg of limestone to produce a ton of crude steel. The main energy requirement is linked to the electricity consumption for smelting the scrap.

With respect to CO2 emissions, the industry has decreased its emissions to around 60 percent in the last 40 years. Most of this reduction has been correlated with the decrease of energy consumption of the integrated route and the shift towards the “recycling route.” Based on a recent assessment of CO2 emissions, direct emissions from the integrated route

                        2.3 ton CO2/ton crude steel.
                      are around ten times more than for the EAF route.

                        0.21 ton CO2/ton crude steel.
                      In any case, iron and steel production is an important source of carbon dioxide emissions due to the energy intensity of steel production, its reliance on carbon-based fuels and reductants.

                        See Carpenter (2012).
                      Nowadays there are many technologies and measures available to abate direct CO2 emissions from the different iron and steelmaking processes such as minimizing energy consumption and improving the energy efficiency of the process, reducing agents with a lower CO2 emission factor or capturing the CO2 and storing it underground.

Our analysis is focused on investigating the consequences of the application of energy-saving technologies, such as the auto-production of electricity combined with measures for CO2 capturing and storing.

The autoproduction of electricity occurs through a system called Top Pressure Recovery Turbine (TRT) which converts the physical energy of high-pressure blast furnace top gas into electricity by using an expansion turbine.

                        5
                        TRT generates electric power of approximately 40–60 kilowatt hour/ton pig iron, see Chunbao and Da-qiang (2010).
                      Although the pressure difference is low, the large gas volumes make the recovery economically feasible (see Hasanbeigi et al., 2010).

Further substantial CO2 reduction can only be achieved by equipping plants with CCS (see Croezen and Korteland, 2010; EPA, 2010), that is currently being discussed as the main future technology to drastically reduce CO2 emissions. After the CO2 is captured it needs to be transported and then injected into a suitable storage site. Capturing emissions from industrial facilities also requires separating out the CO2.

CO2 storage sites are not necessarily close to capture plants. CO2 captured can be transported either by pipeline or ship depending on the distance and on the geological site position. Once CO2 has been captured and transported it needs to be stored safely and permanently. Geological storage involves injecting CO2 underground at depths of around 800 m or more. At such depths the CO2 will be held at many times atmospheric pressure and temperature. In general, there are two types of storage plants: offshore and onshore plants. Offshore plants are located in the sea while onshore ones are on mainland. The difference between them is that offshore sites are more difficult to install and maintain, while onshore plants are visible and thereby reduce the recreational value of the areas they cross.

Currently in Europe there is a project, called Ultra-Low CO2 Steelmaking (ULCOS), which is researching innovative ideas to slash the steel industry’s carbon emissions. It is a consortium of 48 European companies and organizations from 15 European countries that combines various emerging technologies, promising to halve carbon emissions in steelmaking.

The program ULCOS

                      carried out considerable research and it is divided into several stages to achieve the ambitious aims of the project (see Birat, 2009). During the first period (2004–2009), used to study of the feasibility of the project, many technologies have been examined. The studies have led to identify those technologies that enable a significant reduction in carbon emissions in the steelmaking. In particular, among the breakthrough technologies identified by the ULCOS that could lead to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by more than half compared to current best practice, we have studied the so called Top Gas Recycling Blast Furnace (TGR-BF) with CO2 capture and storage. The concept of the TGR-BF relies on separation of the off gases so that the useful components can be recycled back into the furnace and used as a reducing agent. Of course during this process the electricity is a necessary requirement for capturing CO2.

We develop an equilibrium model where the steel producers are Cournot players. In this framework, each company operating in the market maximizes its profits taking into account the competitors decisions.

In our quantitative analysis we estimate the interactions of several market players, we determine the crude steel price and we analyze the investment decisions in CCS technology.

Taking into account that the market structure in the steel industry is mainly oligopolistic, we provide the mathematical formulation of the producers’ problem according to the hypothesis that suppliers can exercise the market power and alter the steel price by changing the amount they sell.

We then represent the model as a Cournot game among steel producers. In a Cournot game the steel price is endogenous in the model while in a perfect competition framework it is assumed to be exogenous.

For each zone i ∈ I, let us define the exogenously given zonal inverse demand function

                         The last balances (9) and (10) quantify the trade of pig iron between different companies and different zones. In this way import and export quantities can be measured. We suppose that all the pig iron production flows have to be consumed for producing steel from the same companies or sold to other companies operating in the market.

Condition (11) imposes the capacity constraints on steel production of technology v ∈ V of plant

This special class of GNEPs has been studied in Rosen (1965).

                           Definition 3
                           Let a jointly convex GNEP be given with for every player ν ∈ N, fν
                               is continuously differentiable in x. We call a solution of the GNEP that is also a solution of VI(X, F) a normalized equilibrium.

An existence result for a GNEP complying with the set-up of Theorem 2 is stated in the following result, which combines Theorems 1 and 2.

                           Corollary 1

                           Assume the setting of Theorem 2 and suppose, additionally, the set X is nonempty and compact. Then a normalized equilibrium exists.

Finally, we suppose that X is defined as follows:

The following theorem, among the solutions of a GNEP, characterizes those that are also VI’s solutions.

                           Assume the setting of Theorem 2 and suppose, additionally, that the set X given by (23) is convex.

                                    Let x be a solution of VI(X, F) at which the KKT conditions (25) hold. Then x is a solution of the GNEP at which KKT conditions (24) hold with λ
                                       1 = … = λN

                                       1 = … = λN
                                       . Then x is a solution of the VI(X, F).

Several numerical approaches for solving a GNEP have been proposed in the literature, see e.g. Bigi et al. (2013),Facchinei and Kanzow (2007),Han et al. (2012),Von Heusinger and Kanzow (2009),Von Heusinger et al. (2012),Nabetani et al. (2011),Pang and Fukushima (2005) and Panicucci (2009). In our problem we will adopt a solution method based on the equivalence between the original problem and the mixed complementarity problem we will define in the next section.

The model we proposed in Section 3 is a GNEP with jointly convex constraints as in (23). In particular, the feasible set can be divided into two blocks of constraints: constraints (7), (11)–(19) are individual constraints of steel companies, while constraints (8)–(10) are shared constraints.

When implementing the model, we will assume that the zonal price functions,

                                 )
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 P

                         are affine and decreasing. Under this additional assumption, rewriting the problem of each company as a minimization problem, it is easy to verify that the objective functions − θc
                        , c ∈ C, are continuously differentiable and convex (quadratic or linear) in all variables that depend on company c and the set X, that includes all the companies constraints, is a nonempty polytope. In particular, X is convex and compact. As a consequence, according to Corollary 1, we can ensure that our GNEP admits at least one normalized equilibrium. In addition the set of constraints is affine, so that Abadie’s constraint qualification holds and the normalized equilibrium is a solution at which the KKT conditions hold. Notice that the KKT system (25) represents a conversion of the VI into a mixed complementarity problem (see Facchinei and Pang, 2003, Vol. 1).

According to these properties, we present the mixed complementarity version of the problem, that is more suitable for computational purposes and we will solve the problem by using the solver PATH with the GAMS interface (see Dirkse and Ferris, 1995; Ferris and Munson, 2000).

Note that the complementarity formulation of the pig iron and steel producers’ model lead to a mixed complementarity problem. The MiCPsteel mixed complementarity problem is composed of the following conditions:

@&#RESULTS@&#

The database we collected gives an overall representation of the world steel sector with a particular focus on the European market, that is regulated by the EU-ETS and where CCS projects have been developed. The steel sector is divided in seven zones: Italy, France, Germany, Spain, CIS (Russia and Ukraine), Mediterranean (e.g. MED) Area (namely Turkey, Algeria, Egypt) and ASIA (China and India).

We globally consider 53 steel companies and 122 plants (see Table 1
                        ) since each company can have more than one plant in regulated and/or unregulated zones. We complete the zonal markets with a fringe composed by the other small companies. Each company competes in the international trade market by selling and buying pig iron and steel within the intra-zonal and inter-zonal market. We consider two types of technologies: integrated route which produces pig iron and steel and is fitted with BF and BOF, and electric route that produces steel from scrap in the EAF (recycling route). In particular we collected data related to 48 plants operating with the integrated technology and 74 plants that produce steel with the electric one.

The pig iron and steel capacity data have been picked, when possible, from the websites of each company and the annual reports or from the websites of associations (see Appendix A for the detailed list of companies and the website links).

Operation costs, input consumption and emission factors are strictly dependent on the adopted technology and plants’ location. Table 2

                         and electricity prices. Data on conversion factors (raw materials, electricity and fuel consumption) are available in BREF 2011 and IEA 2007 (see European Commission, IPPC Cembureau, 2011; International Energy Agency, 2007).

Zonal pig iron and steel demand are modeled by using an affine inverse demand function depending on zones; demand parameters (zonal reference price and consumption) are estimated using data provided by Eurofer and World Steel Association (see EUROFER, 2010; World Steel Association, 2010). The demand function is constructed taking an elasticity value equal to 0.3.

                           10
                           We set this elasticity demand as base case on the lines of the relevant literature (see for example Demailly and Quirion, 2007).
                        
                     

In our analysis we consider as scenario baseline year 2020. Cost, demand and price data are then estimated using annual growth rates as described in Pardo et al. (2012).


                        Table 3
                         reports data related to CCS technology: storage and transportation costs are picked from ZEP, investments costs and capacities are available in Pardo et al. (2012), and European Commission reports the electricity consumption data.

Storage and transportation costs strictly depend on the onshore and offshore storage sites. It can be observed that Germany’s costs are very high with respect to the other European countries. In this model we assume that the nearest storage site is located in the North Sea (see ZEP).

Finally, since we do not account for new plants investment policies, we assume that, for each plant, the investment costs have been fully amortized. We leave this kind of analysis for future research.

In this section, we show the major results of our analysis provided by the simulations. The MiCPsteel ((CC), (EC), (26)–(44)) has been implemented in GAMS using PATH as solver (Dirkse and Ferris, 1995; Ferris and Munson, 1999).

We study the quantitative implications of the model by conducting numerical simulations based on different CO2 prices.

More precisely, the effects of allowance price on steel price profits and investments in CCS technology are studied.

As concerning the EU-ETS normative, the computation of the CO2 cap is based on National Allocation Plans (NAPs) reserved to installations in the regulated countries (Italy, Spain, Germany and France). In order to avoid the problem of allowance overallocation (see, for instance, Corporate Europe Observatory, 2010), we assume that the CO2 market is more stringent than it has actually been for the last few years and will probably be in the third EU-ETS phase (2013–2020). European Commission is preparing the new carbon leakage list for 2015–2019, and free permits allocation will be probably discussed and modified. At this time, in absence of other indications, we impose that the ratio of grandfathered allowances to caps is 90 percent, a figure in line with the directives for the second and third ETS phases.

Focusing on our analysis, we consider two different 2020 baseline scenarios:

                           
                              •

                                 CCS: EU-ETS is applied as a cap and trade system with free allowances allocation;

Both cases are simulated by varying CO2 price from 10 euros to 70 euros.

In this section we analyze investment decisions in implementing CCS technology and electricity autoproduction with different CO2 price levels. With overallocation of pollution permits in the last years CO2 price progressively decreased. Redefining new criteria for permit allocation in the phase (2013–2020) and looking for the decarbonization of the system in 2050, it is reasonable to make previsions on CO2 price increments up to 70 euros.

                              Recent papers, see for example Pardo et al. (2012), show an analysis varying the CO2 price until 200 euros in 2030.

                            shows the variation in CCS technology penetration in the steel plants in the different European countries. If the CO2 price is lower than 40 euros there is no convenience in introducing CCS setting. In France the pilot project ULCOS forecasts a CO2 storage near the integrated plants;

                            so the investments become more convenient when the allocation price is 40 euros. Permit price has to reach the level of 70 euros to involve all the considered countries in investing in this innovative technology. As expected Germany, that suffers of the higher cost for transporting and storing in off-shore sites, is the last country in introducing this type of technology.


                           Figs. 2
                            –4 compare steel price in presence or absence of CCS and electricity autoproduction technologies under three difference scenarios: emissions price equal to 10 euros, 40 euros and 70 euros. Steel reference price is computed in 2020 scenario when CCS technologies are planned to be introduced. In Fig. 2
                            it can be observed that CIS country has the lower steel price followed by ASIA. It is not surprising since CIS is the main exporter of steel in the European and Mediterranean areas. As reported in Fig. 1, European countries do not invest in CCS with the CO2 price equal to 10 euros but we impose that all these countries have electricity autoproduction. For this reason, the prices differ in the two scenarios analyzed: ETS

                           CCS and ETS

                           CCS. This difference can be addicted to minor electricity cost induced by autoproduction. As concerning Fig. 3
                            the increment in steel price can be interpreted with CO2 cost pass through. On average 46 percent of CO2 price increment is embedded in the final steel price both in the case of ETS

                           CCS and ETS

                           CCS. It is worth noticing that only France starts investing in CCS. In Fig. 4 this difference varies depending on these two scenarios: in ETS
                              _
                           CCS scenario the proportion between steel price increment and CO2 price increment is on average 56 percent, while in ETS

                           CCS corresponds to 60 percent.

                            reports the trend of the steel sector profits in the different scenarios. Taking into account the two extreme cases (10 euros and 70 euros) the profit increment is about 7.7 percent in the ETS
                              _
                           CCS and 8 percent in the ETS

                           CCS case, respectively. As concerning ETS

                           CCS the increment in profits when varying CO2 price is direct effect of steel price increment but total profit rise is mitigated by a contraction of steel production (taking the extreme cases as reference, steel production

                            decreases of about 2.5 percent while price increases of about 3.2 percent). In the ETS
                              _
                           CCS scenario, steel production decreases of about 2.4 percent while price increases of about 3.1 percent. By comparing profits with and without CCS settlement, profits are higher without the CCS technology than with it and the difference increases when CO2 price rises. The investment costs in CCS influence the total profit and are not passed into the final steel price. In addiction, the CO2 cost transferred into the final steel price is lower than in ETS
                              _
                           No
                              _
                           CCS case as described in the previous section.

Looking at the behavior of profits in European countries, Fig. 6
                            shows that profits are higher when CCS technology is applied. This is in apparent contradiction with the trend at worldwide level where CCS profits are lower than the other case. Trying to explain the reason of profit increments, we determine the allowance gain under the different CO2 scenarios (see Fig. 7
                           ). The number of permits that can be sold in the market increases when the CO2 price increases. This is due to the fact that companies decide to invest in CCS technology by saving emission rights. When the price is greater than 40 euro the allowance gain becomes positive and the number of permissions sold in the market is equal to 4.9, 11.5 and 23.7 millions with 50, 60 and 70 euro allowances price, respectively. The highest level of allowance gain is reached when all European countries decide to invest in CCS technology.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The spatial equilibrium model presented in Section 3 is used to evaluate the economic impacts of the environmental regulation on the pig iron and steel sectors. In particular, we adopt a technological representation of the international iron and steel markets that covers the main European steel producers (namely Italy, France, Germany and Spain), the Russia and Mediterranean areas and Far East countries.

The model proposed allows us to analyze the market participants’ action, to determine endogenously the price of the crude steel and to understand the investment decisions in CCS infrastructure. For this reason, we consider several scenarios under the CO2 regulation with and without considering CCS technology and electricity autoproduction. The scenarios also include simulations setting the model to different CO2 prices.

Under these assumptions, the analysis shows the variation in CCS technology penetration in the steel plants in the different European countries. In particular, if the CO2 price is lower than 40 euros there is no convenience in introducing CCS setting. Permit price has to reach the level of 70 euros to involve all the countries subject to EU-ETS regulation in investing in this innovative technology.

Furthermore, we analyze the price of crude steel as an output of the spatial equilibrium model that depends on complex interactions between climate and energy policies and the introduction of the CCS and electricity autoproduction. As expected, we obtain that CIS country has the lower steel price followed by ASIA.

Finally, we show that, comparing profits with and without CCS settlement, total profits (considering both European and non European countries) are higher without the CCS technology than with it and the difference between them increases when CO2 price rises. If we look deeper into European profits, the relationship is the opposite: profits of European countries are higher when CCS technology is introduced. This can be addicted to allowance gain obtained by the savings of emission rights.

Finally, comparing steel price increment with respect to CO2 price increment, the introduction of CCS technology has a positive impact on the contraction of CO2 cost pass through.

A policy of reducing emission permits given for free to industrial sectors and at the same time introduction of incentives for investing in CCS technologies, could avoid the carbon leakage effects (in particular capacity relocation in unregulated countries) and mitigate allowance gain distortion.

Further developments of this work are in two different directions: considering different environmental policies and industrial incentives mechanisms, by including the possibility of investing in new plants and modeling the equilibrium problem as a cooperative game (see e.g. Ferrara, 2006; Ferrara and Stefanescu, 2006).
