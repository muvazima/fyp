In aeronautical terms, the rotation-minimizing osculating frame (RMOF) specifies yaw-free rigid-body motion along a curved path. For polynomial space curves possessing rational Frenet frames, the existence of rational RMOFs is investigated, and it is found that they must be of degree 7 at least. The RMOF is also employed to construct a novel type of ruled surface, with the property that its tangent planes coincide with the osculating planes of a given space curve, and its rulings exhibit the least possible rate of rotation consistent with this constraint.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A general spatial motion of a rigid body is specified by describing its position and orientation as functions of time. A particular point of the body (e.g., the center of mass) is usually chosen to describe position. To describe orientation, the variation of an orthonormal frame 
                        (
                        
                           
                              e
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                        ,
                        
                           
                              e
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                        ,
                        
                           
                              e
                           
                           
                              3
                           
                        
                        )
                      embedded within the body may be specified. In general, position and orientation vary independently, but in certain motion problems they may be correlated. This study is concerned with constrained spatial motions, in which the instantaneous angular velocity of a rigid body is related to the geometry of its center-of-mass path.

The Frenet frame is the most familiar orthonormal frame on a space curve, comprising the tangent 
                     t, principal normal 
                     p, and binormal 
                     
                        b
                        =
                        t
                        ×
                        p
                     . When the Frenet frame is used to orient a body along a path, its angular velocity 
                        ω
                      satisfies 
                        ω
                        ⋅
                        p
                        ≡
                        0
                      — i.e., it has no component in the principal normal direction. This means that the body exhibits no instantaneous rotation about the principal normal vector p from point to point along the path.

In aerodynamics, an embedded frame is used (Cook, 1997) to characterize variations in the attitude of an aircraft, in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw axes through its center of mass — the roll (or longitudinal) axis is aligned with the fuselage; the pitch (or lateral) axis is orthogonal to it, within the plane of the fuselage and wings; and the yaw (or vertical) axis is orthogonal to that plane. Hence, pitch and yaw correspond to up/down and left/right motions of the aircraft nose, while roll corresponds to a rotation about the fuselage.

A rigid body that maintains alignment with the Frenet frame on a given spatial path exhibits a pitch-free motion — it has no instantaneous rotation about the principal normal p. For a given (smooth) path, it is also possible to construct roll-free and yaw-free rigid-body motions, characterized by no instantaneous rotation about the tangent t and binormal b, respectively.

Roll-free motion, with angular velocity satisfying 
                        ω
                        ⋅
                        t
                        ≡
                        0
                     , has recently enjoyed considerable attention. In this case, the body has no instantaneous rotation about the tangent t from point to point along the path. Bishop (1975) first studied adapted orthonormal frames 
                        (
                        t
                        ,
                        u
                        ,
                        v
                        )
                      comprising the tangent t and normal-plane vectors u, v that have no instantaneous rotation about t, in lieu of p, b. Klok (1986) described the vectors u, v as solutions to differential equations, and Guggenheimer (1989) subsequently showed that these solutions amount to defining u, v by a normal-plane rotation of p, b through an angle equal to minus the integral of the torsion with respect to arc length.

For polynomial or rational curves, this rotation-minimizing adapted frame (RMAF) is not, in general, a rational locus, and this fact has prompted many approximation schemes (Farouki and Han, 2003; Jüttler and Mäurer, 1999; Wang et al., 2008). More recently, interest has emerged in identifying curves with rational rotation-minimizing frames (RRMF curves), which must be Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves (Farouki, 2008), since only PH curves possess rational unit tangents. The Euler–Rodrigues frame (ERF), a rational adapted frame defined on any PH curve, is a useful intermediary in identifying RRMF curves (Choi and Han, 2002; Han, 2008). The simplest non-planar RRMF curves form a subset of the PH quintics (Farouki et al., 2009a), characterized by the satisfaction of simple constraints on the curve coefficients (Farouki, 2010). Further details on the basic theory, properties, and applications of RRMF curves can be found in Barton et al. (2010), Farouki et al. (2012), Farouki and Sakkalis (2010, 2012).

Among the spatial motions mentioned above, in which angular velocity is correlated with local path geometry, the least-studied is the case of yaw-free motion satisfying 
                        ω
                        ⋅
                        b
                        ≡
                        0
                     . In yaw-free motion, the orientation of the body is specified by a frame 
                        (
                        f
                        ,
                        g
                        ,
                        b
                        )
                      that retains the binormal b, but the tangent and principal normal t, p are replaced by osculating-plane vectors f, g that have no instantaneous rotation about b. It is shown below that the vectors f, g can be defined through an osculating-plane rotation of t, p by an angle equal to minus the integral of the curvature with respect to arc length. We call the frame 
                        (
                        f
                        ,
                        g
                        ,
                        b
                        )
                      a rotation-minimizing osculating frame (RMOF).

The plan for the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the concept of rotation-minimizing frames on curves, and briefly mentions how it can also be used to identify certain special curves on a smooth surface (geodesics, lines of curvature, and asymptotic lines). Section 3 addresses the problem of rational rotation-minimizing frames — after briefly reviewing rational RMAFs, a detailed analysis of rational RMOFs on cubic and quintic space curves with rational Frenet frames is presented. Section 4 employs the RMOF to construct ruled surfaces interpolating a space curve, with tangent planes matching the osculating planes of that curve, and derives some useful properties of such surfaces. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the key results of this study, and identifies some open problems.

                        Remark 1
                        From Definition 1, we observe that the Frenet frame is rotation-minimizing with respect to the principal normal p, but not with respect to the tangent t or binormal b. For a plane curve, it is also rotation-minimizing with respect to the tangent t.

Although the Frenet frame is not rotation-minimizing with respect to t, one can easily derive such a rotation-minimizing frame from it. New normal-plane vectors

                     . A frame incorporating the tangent t is an adapted frame, and when it is rotation-minimizing with respect to t it is called a rotation-minimizing adapted frame (RMAF). Such frames describe natural spatial motions of a rigid body that maintains one principal axis aligned with the path tangent, while the other principal axes have no instantaneous rotation about the tangent. These motions are useful in computer animation, the use of sweep operations in geometric design, robot path planning, programming of CNC machines with rotary axes, and related applications.

By modification of the Frenet frame, one can also define a frame that is rotation-minimizing with respect to the binormal b. New osculating-plane vectors

                      are the geodesic curvature, geodesic torsion, and normal curvature along the surface curve. In terms of these quantities, the geodesics, line of curvatures, and asymptotic lines on a smooth surface may be characterized (Kreyszig, 1959; Struik, 1961) as loci along which

From Definition 1, we obtain the following alternative succinct characterizations, which are useful in the construction of surface patches bounded by geodesics (Farouki et al., 2009c; Paluszny, 2008; Sánchez-Reyes and Dorado, 2008); lines of curvature (Biard et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Martin, 1983); and asymptotic lines (Bayram et al., 2012).

Exact rational frames are preferable to approximations when possible, since they provide a precise and efficient means of orienting a rigid body along a given path. After briefly reviewing the theory of rational RMAFs below, we consider its adaptation to the problem of identifying rational RMOFs.

The existence of rational RMAFs on polynomial space curves has recently been studied (Farouki, 2010). A polynomial space curve with a rational RMAF must be a Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve, since only the PH curves have rational unit tangents (Farouki, 2008). The distinctive property of a polynomial PH curve

                           Remark 2
                           Because of their rational Frenet frames, curvature, and torsion, we shall focus here on rational RMOFs on DPH curves, and do not address at present the existence of non-DPH curves that possess rational binormals and admit rational rotation-minimizing osculating-plane basis vectors f, g.

A (general) helix is characterized by the fact that its tangent t maintains a constant inclination ψ (the pitch angle) with respect to a fixed direction a (the axis of the helix) and the curvature/torsion ratio is constant (Kreyszig, 1959; Struik, 1961). A polynomial helix must be a PH curve (Farouki et al., 2004) — in fact, a DPH curve (Farouki et al., 2009b). All PH cubics and all helical PH quintics are DPH curves, but non-helical DPH curves of degree ⩾7 exist. Complete details may be found in Beltran and Monterde (2007), Farouki et al. (2009b), Monterde (2009).


                        
                           Remark 3
                           For any DPH curve, the Frenet frame specifies a rational pitch-free motion, since the Frenet frame is rotation-minimizing with respect to the principal normal, and it is also rational for double PH curves.

The ERF is of no use in constructing a rational RMOF, since it does not incorporate the binormal b and two rational vectors spanning the osculating plane, to which a rotation can be applied to cancel the angular velocity component in the direction of b. Instead, we use the rational Frenet frame (23) for a DPH curve, and seek a rational osculating-plane rotation

                              . It then follows from (28) that the torsion vanishes, so the curve is planar.  □

One is thus led to consider satisfaction of (25) in the case of DPH quintics, which are equivalent to the quintic helical polynomial space curves: for such curves, 
                           γ
                           (
                           ξ
                           )
                         is a quadratic polynomial. The characterization of curves that have rational RMOFs, as solutions to (25), is more difficult than the problem of identifying curves with rational RMAFs, satisfying (19). Unlike (19), the numerator polynomial on the left in (25) is not known explicitly in terms of u, v, p, q — instead, γ must be determined from conditions (20)–(21).

                               constant, i.e., the Frenet frame is an RMOF. But this occurs only if the curvature vanishes, so the curve is just a straight line.

Surfaces generated by the motion of a straight line through space are called ruled surfaces. Each instance of the line is a ruling or generator of the surface. A special class of ruled surfaces, the developable surfaces, is characterized by a constant surface normal along each ruling. A surface is developable if and only if it is the envelope of a one-parameter family of planes. A developable surface, regarded as a thin material sheet, can be “flattened” (or developed) onto a plane, without stretching or compressing it (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen, 1952; Kreyszig, 1959; Struik, 1961).

Several important ruled surfaces are associated with a space curve. The surface generated by the curve tangent lines is a developable surface, known as the tangent developable — it can also be interpreted as the envelope of the curve osculating planes. However, for space curves, the surfaces generated by lines along the principal normal and binormal directions at each point are not developable (Kreyszig, 1959). The envelopes of the normal planes and the rectifying planes to a space curve are called the polar developable and rectifying developable.

If the tangent developable is developed onto a plane, the space curve maps to a plane curve, the generators of the surface becoming its tangents. The two curves have equal curvatures at corresponding points, and equal arc lengths of corresponding segments (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen, 1952). When the rectifying developable is developed onto a plane, the curve maps to a straight line, corresponding segments of the curve and the line having equal lengths. The polar developable can be regarded as the analog, for a space curve, of the evolute of a plane curve (Struik, 1961).

For the tangent surface (50) and principal normal surface (51), the angular velocity 
                           ω
                         of the rulings is defined by the Darboux vector (5), in which the term 
                           κ
                           b
                         specifies an “unnecessary” rotation in the osculating plane — i.e., it is not required for the tangent plane of 
                           s
                           (
                           ξ

                         to be coincident with the osculating plane of 
                           r

                           )
                         at each point. A rotation-minimizing ruled surface, interpolating a given curve and its osculating planes, can be defined by using one of the basis vectors (10)–(11) to specify the rulings, so as to eliminate the term 
                           κ

                         Because the surface normal varies with λ, the surface (54) is not developable.

The surface normal (55) is singular along each ruling at a parameter value ξ for which the angle (11) is an integer multiple of π — i.e., at points where the ruling direction f is parallel or anti-parallel to the tangent. Since the curvature is non-negative, the angle (11) is monotone-increasing with ξ, and such singular rulings occur at points on 
                           r
                           (
                           ξ
                           )
                         determined by its curvature. In practice, one would restrict the surface (54) to intervals between such points: the integration constant 
                           
                              
                                 θ
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                         in (11) can be used to adjust such intervals.

                               is a segment of the circular helix (13). For all three ruled surfaces, the tangent plane coincides with the osculating plane along the helix, but the rotation-minimizing ruled surface exhibits the least possible angular velocity of its rulings consistent with this constraint.


                        
                           Remark 5
                           The pitch provides a convenient way of piecing together portions of two non-developable ruled surfaces, with

                               continuity (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen, 1952). A generator is chosen from each surface, having equal pitch values. Then, if these generators are placed in coincidence, such that the points of striction are coincident, and the surface tangent planes are in agreement at this point, the two surfaces will possess a common tangent plane along the common generator. The rotation-minimizing ruled surfaces (54) are particularly amenable to this construction, because of the simple nature of their pitch and lines of striction.

The variation of the Frenet frame, comprising the tangent t, principal normal p, and binormal b, characterizes the local geometry of a space curve. The Frenet frame is rotation-minimizing with respect to p — i.e., t and b have no rotation about p. Rotation-minimizing adapted frames, characterized by normal-plane vectors u and v with no rotation about t, are also well-known. The focus of this study has been on rotation-minimizing osculating frames, incorporating osculating-plane vectors f and g that have no rotation about the binormal b. The vectors f, g can be defined by rotating t, p through an angle equal to minus the integral of the curvature with respect to arc length.

A comprehensive study of the existence of rational RMOFs on low-degree polynomial space curves indicates no cubic or quintic double PH curves with this property. The existence of rational RMOFs on degree 7 or higher-order curves remains an open problem. The use of RMOFs for the construction of a novel type of ruled surface, interpolating a space curve with tangent planes that are coincident with the osculating planes along the curve, and minimal rotation of the rulings under this constraint, was also investigated.
