@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Lanthanide inorganic functional materials with optical properties remain to be challenging issues due to their sharp emission bands, excited state lifetimes and high color purity [1–3]. Their extraordinary fluorescent features can be promising as the replacement for quantum dots. From the perspective of rare earth activated materials, oxides, borates, vanadates and phosphates were usually considered as hosts in terms of internal phases and stabilities [4–6]. Except the above mentioned systems, rare earth fluorides have also been the focus of extensive studies in recent decades because of their potential uses in optics and optoelectronics. Particularly, the up-conversion nanoparticles derived from rare earth fluorides with lower energy irradiations could exhibit higher energy output emissions. They have been considered as promising bioimaging probes with several advantages including less scattering and deep penetration in biological tissues [7]. Hence, the exploration of the efficient method is urgently necessary [8–13]. Efforts have been dedicated to investigate their micro-structures and methodology. It is known that lanthanide fluorides (abbreviated as LnF3) with different morphologies have been obtained. Still, it has not been reported that the general methodology studies for its preparation and comparison based on a systematic way.

In this work, the synthesis of LnF3 can be described as three sections. Firstly, La

                     Lu1
                     −
                     
                        x
                     F3: Eu3+ with characteristic red emissions was successfully achieved in terms of different fluxes (NaCl, KCl, NaNO3, KNO3) via a molten salt method. The effects of fluxes and sintering temperature on fluorescence properties were extensively studied. Secondly, we demonstrate a co-precipitation route to synthesize LaF3–CaF2:Eu3+ and its red luminescence can be detected. The activator concentration (Eu3+), La/Ca ratio and temperature were also investigated.

In order to enhance chemical reactivity and decrease reaction time or increase yields, ultrasound and microwave irradiations were employed to stimulate the reactive systems. Here in this case, we have prepared LaF3 crystals by means of two approaches. A pure phase lanthanum fluoride could be obtained using this simple treatment. These experimental results will offer fundamental insights into the luminescence control and formation of nano-scale materials.

All the starting materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and used as received. Lanthanide oxides and NaF were provided by Shanghai chemical reagent company. Lanthanide nitrates were prepared from oxides through nitration. The supersonic assisted microwave reactor was commercially available and produced by Nanjing Xianou technology company, China (XO-SM50). Fluorescence spectra were measured in an Edinburgh FLS920 spectrometer, respectively. Scanning electronic microscope (SEM) was measured with JSM-6360LV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed in JEM-2100HR. X-ray powder diffraction was investigated at Y-2000 of Dandong Aolong company, P.R. China. Fluorescent microscope images were acquired from a Nikon Eclipse TS100 inverted fluorescence microscope system (Japan), equipped with a 50W mercury lamp.

Stoichiometric portions of La2O3 (1.6mmol), Lu2O3 (0.4mmol), Eu2O3 (0.12mmol) and NaF (6mmol) were mixed together in a crucible and ground into powders for 20min. NaNO3 or other salts (20mmol) was added into the mixture and continued to grind into fine powders. Then the sample was put into a muffle oven and sintered at different temperatures (500–1000°C). The as-derived powders were collected and kept in vacuum for measurements. La/Lu ratio, europium concentration, temperature and molten salts can be variable according to different comparison tests.

In a typical preparation, La(NO3)3 (0.6mmol), CaCl2 (0.4mmol) and Eu(NO3)3 (0.05mmol) were dissolved in 20ml distilled water. NaF (2.6mmol) was added in the above solution. pH value was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of NaOH. Then the mixture was stirred at 75°C for 2 hours. The precipitate was retrieved by centrifugation, washed by ethanol and distilled water twice. The precursor was put into a muffle oven and sintered at different temperatures (500–900°C). The as-derived powders were collected and kept in vacuum for measurements. La/Ca ratio, europium concentration and sintering temperature can be changed according to different comparison tests.

La(NO3)3 (2mmol), NaF (6mmol) and Eu(NO3)3 (0.06mmol) were dissolved in distilled water (40ml). The mixture was transferred to a three neck flask which adapted the reactor. Microwave power was set as 400W and reaction temperature remained to be 50°C. Supersonic power was 400W with the reverse duty cycle 2s. All the operation time was fixed as 40min. The as-derived sample was retrieved by centrifugation, washed by ethanol and distilled water twice, then dried at 60°C in vacuum. The reaction time, temperature and frequency could be changed in terms of comparison experiments.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Based on X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis, two kinds of crystal structures were identified in the sample of La0.8Lu0.2F3: Eu3+. The diffraction peaks given in Fig. 1
                      can be indexed as mixture of LaF3 and LuF3. The positions of the peaks are in accordance with the JCPDS cards (No. 32-0483 and 32-0612). The data substantiated that the phase pure LaF3 and LuF3 could be achieved through a facile process such as molten salts method. Here we emphasized the effects of methodology studies on the products. Fig. 1B shows the XRD pattern of the as-derived sample LaF3–CaF2:Eu3+ (La/Ca=6/4). For LaF3, the crystalline structure still conforms to a hexagonal phase. In addition, we can also observe the existence of a cubic phase of CaF2 (JCPDS 87-0971) [14]. Fig. 1C presents the XRD curve of LaF3: Eu3+ and the achieved peaks correspond to the LaF3 hexagonal phase. It has been accepted that the study of chemical effects of supersonic and microwave would be a rapidly increasing research area [15,16]. High intensity ultrasound or microwave irradiation can induce a wide range of chemical and physical consequences. The formation, growth and disappearance of generated bubbles in the reacted solutions will provide intense local heat and high pressure which may drive high-energy chemical reactions (especially during the process of bubble collapse). Furthermore, the assisted microwave at the same time will bring higher conversion rates and shorter reaction times. Consequently, the samples prepared by supersonic and microwave multiple irradiations only cost 40min at 50°C. It is known that the traditional methods (including molten salts and co-precipitation) will need at least 1–2h or sintering treatment, this new way greatly saves time and energy and can be regarded as an efficient replacement for retrieving phosphors.

Using fluxes, we can see a few particles with the diameter of 300–400nm in the sample of La0.8Lu0.2F3: Eu3+ (Fig. 2
                     a). In the case of the co-precipitation method, the result indicated that uniform and compact micro-meter scale particles appeared with the size distribution between 1 and 2μm (Fig. 2b). The final facile mild-solution-based irradiation approach has generated aggregated granules and the tendency of 1D dimensional microstructure could be observed (Fig. 2c).

                      provides the excitation spectrum in the region of 200–550nm by monitoring the 5D0
                     →
                     7F2 emission at 615nm. The huge band at 273nm corresponds to the charge transfer state (O-Eu), suggesting that LnOF:Eu3+ may exist [17,18]. The characteristic peaks of Eu3+ in the longer wavelength (350–550nm) were not well-resolved. Emission spectra were obtained upon the excitation at 273nm. All the curves gave sharp lines of Eu3+ ions, which were associated with its transitions from 5D0 to 7FJ (J
                     =1, 2, 3) at 591, 615 and 656nm respectively (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the emissions from these levels were favored when La/Lu ratio reached to be 8/2. Therefore, the concentration value was fixed to be 8/2 for next steps. For the sake of finding the suitable amounts of the dopants (Eu3+), europium concentrations were changed in the range of 1–10mol%. The emission intensities of 5D0
                     →
                     7F2 transitions have enhanced in terms of the increasing amount of Eu3+. 6mol% europium ions have the highest luminescence (Fig. 4
                     a). Various salts were tried to prepare the same product, NaNO3 played as the most suitable one to synthesize La0.8Lu0.2F3: Eu3+ phosphors (Fig. 4b). Although the fabrication of some rare-earth fluorides through molten salts approach has been investigated [19,20], the detailed studies of mixed lanthanide elements (La3+ and Lu3+) as hosts, activator concentration (Eu) and reaction temperature have never been reported. We also focused on the sintering process and different temperatures have been tested (Fig. 4c). Facts proved that 600°C is the most ideal temperature that will be selected in this molten salts method.

The excitation spectra of LaF3–CaF2:Eu3+ can be separated into two sections. The large band located at 270nm was similar to La0.8Lu0.2F3: Eu3+ that was caused by charge transfer (Fig. S1). However, the intra-configuration transitions of europium ions from ground level 7F0 to the excited states were identified. The classical peaks at 395, 466 and 533nm are attributed to 7F0
                     →
                     5L6, 7F0
                     →
                     5D2 and 7F0
                     →
                     5D1 transitions (Fig. 5
                     , inset). Under different excitation wavelengths, the sensitized material showed typical 5D0
                     →
                     7FJ (J
                     =1, 2, 3, 4) transitions (Fig. 5). Especially, it would be attractive that the green light (533nm) can be also utilized as the pumping source. This visible-light-sensitized phosphor (LaF3–CaF2:Eu3+) will open a new way to be used in bio-medical diagnosis. A better understanding of the optical data can be achieved from the parameters changes. The influence of europium concentration, La/Ca ratio and sintering temperature on the luminescence has been studied and the optimized results were obtained (5%, La/Ca=6/4 and sintering temperature 650°C) (Fig. 6
                     ).

The excitation spectrum of LaF3: Eu3+ by ultrasound and microwave irradiations can be clearly assigned to be the charge transfer band (270nm) and 7F0
                     →
                     5L6 (395nm) transition (Fig. 7
                     , inset). Other europium peaks longer than 400nm were very weak and had minor contribution to the excitation. The narrow emission peaks in the range of 550–750nm were attributed to the 5D0
                     →
                     7FJ transitions (Fig. 7). Compared with the previous two phosphors, 5D0
                     →
                     7F1 orange emission is the most prominent group and stronger than 5D0
                     →
                     7F2. It is well accepted that Eu3+ in this case may locate at a site with inversion symmetry due to the primary magnet dipole transition. It suggested that this fast-synthesis method might change the crystal sites or host (fluoride) conditions. In an analogous fashion, we measured the detailed parameters influence of ultrasound and microwave treatments. Results showed that the best reaction time, temperature and frequency would be 40min, 50°C and 400W respectively (Fig. 8
                     ). The assembly of europium (III) doped LaF3 has been carried out by a series of methods such as hydrothermal synthesis, and co-precipitation or fluoride source changes [21–24], this facile way based on multiple irradiations is still considered to be new and promising for the controllable synthesis of phosphors.

For all the three materials, a full fluorescent property measurement of their surfaces was recorded using a fluorescent microscope as shown in the images (Figs. 9
                      and S2). They gave striking Eu3+ red emissions and the aggregated particles were uniformly dispersed.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We demonstrated the general synthesis of LnF3 crystals and discussed the structures, properties and morphology via different methods. Three types of lanthanide fluorides were achieved and all exhibited characteristic red emissions. NaNO3 was proved to be the most suitable molten salt to fabricate La

                     F3: Eu3+. The as-derived Eu3+-doped LaF3–CaF2 phosphor can be excited under various visible lights (466 and 533nm). The employment of supersonic and microwave irradiation plays a predominant role in obtaining LaF3: Eu3+ crystals within 40min under very low temperature (50°C). These data will certainly enrich the contents of lanthanide solid state luminescent materials synthesis.
