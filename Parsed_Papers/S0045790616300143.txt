                  Computational complexity and power consumption are prominent issues in wireless telemonitoring applications involving physiological signals. Because of its energy-efficient data reduction procedure, compressed sensing (CS) emerged as a promising framework to address these challenges. In this work, a multi-channel CS framework is explored for multi-channel electrocardiogram (MECG) signals. The work focuses on the successful joint recovery of the MECG signals using a low number of measurements by exploiting the correlated information across the channels. A CS recovery algorithm based on weighted mixed-norm minimization (WMNM) is proposed that exploits the joint sparsity of MECG signals in the wavelet domain and recovers signals from all the channels simultaneously. The proposed WMNM algorithm follows a weighting strategy to emphasize the diagnostically important MECG features. Experimental results on various MECG databases show that the proposed method can achieve superior reconstruction quality with high compression efficiency as compared to its non-weighted counterpart and other existing CS-based ECG compression techniques.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Compressed sensing (CS) is an emerging signal processing technique that enables the acquisition of sparse signals in a small set of linear projections (called measurements) [1]. The size of measurement vector is much smaller than that of the original signal, but it still contains the required information for exact signal recovery. CS exploits the signal structure and enables signal acquisition at sub-Nyquist rate, directly outputting the compressed form of the signal. Consequently, the signal encoding becomes quite simple and energy-efficient in the CS framework. This feature of CS motivated its use in many resource-constrained applications [2–8]. In these applications, CS offers potential solutions to some of the major challenges, such as energy efficiency, computational complexity, memory usage, etc. Wireless body area network (WBAN)-enabled mobile electrocardiogram (ECG) telemonitoring is one such application where CS has been successfully used to reduce the energy consumption and complexity of the system [3–8]. For energy-efficient data reduction, CS-based WBAN applications exploit the inherent sparse nature of ECG signals either in the time domain [4,5], or wavelet domain [3,6–8]. Though, conventional wavelet-based ECG compression methods have higher data compression capability than CS-based approaches, their data encoding cost is significantly higher [3]. Because of this, CS-based techniques emerged as an effective alternative to wavelet-based methods for WBAN applications.

In earlier studies, Mamaghanian et al. [3] established and quantified the potential of CS for low-complexity and energy-efficient data reduction in the WBAN-enabled ECG monitors. Various design considerations were studied by Dixon et al. [4] for the CS-based data acquisition and reconstruction systems. A block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL)-based approach was employed by Zhang et al. [5] for the fetal-ECG telemonitoring applications. Recently, some techniques utilizing prior knowledge about ECG signals in the traditional CS reconstruction algorithms have been reported with improved results [6,7]. In the aforementioned works, the telemonitoring systems studied are limited to single channel ECG signals. However, multi-channel or multi-lead ECG (MECG) signals are preferred by cardiologists for detailed diagnosis [9]. Motivated by this, we present a study of the MECG signals in a joint CS framework, intended for the remote healthcare applications. The ECG signals acquired through different channels are not independent. Instead, they share mutual cardiac information common to all channels. The source of this information is the electrical heart vector. The projection of this vector in different directions leads to ECG signals in different channels. In such a scenario, channel-by-channel processing of MECG is not optimal in terms of the computational cost as well as the system performance. Hence, some novel unified CS-based approaches are required for the correlated MECG signals.

In the proposed work, the CS model is based on a multiple-measurement-vector (MMV) approach [10]. This is unlike the earlier models based on traditional single-measurement-vector (SMV) [3,4,7,8]. The MMV, or row-sparse modeling of the MECG signals, helps exploit the natural group sparsity of different channels, which is present because of their inherent correlated structure. Recently, the MMV approach has been used for the MECG signals in a CS-based joint compression work employing a mixed-norm minimization (MNM)-based signal recovery [11]. It is to be noted that when the number of measurements is low (at higher compression ratios), the performance of the algorithm was observed to be unsatisfactory. The amplitude dependence of the MNM algorithms, similar to traditional l
                     1-norm minimization algorithms, might be the reason behind this under-performance [12,13]. Due to the amplitude dependence, the nonzero rows corresponding to the higher coefficients in joint sparse representation are penalized more than those corresponding to the lower coefficients during the optimization procedure [12]. Hence, the MNM algorithm used in [11] is unable to preserve the clinically important higher wavelet coefficients during joint MECG recovery. The problem gets more pronounced when the number of measurements is less, which results in higher reconstruction error. To address this issue in SMV formulations, methods based on iterative re-weighting were proposed [12,14]. These algorithms received significant attention due to their improved performance over their non-weighted counterparts. The reweighted SMV algorithms can be directly extended for the MMV problems (like joint MECG recovery) by using mixed-norm optimization [13]. A similar idea was used in [15], where a weighting scheme in accordance with the importance of singular values was proposed to enhance the performance of standard nuclear norm minimization. Thus, it can be concluded that the weighting approach allows more flexibility and enables easy incorporation of additional constraints in the joint optimization problems [14]. This motivated us to use a weighting scheme in the traditional MNM-based recovery algorithms. This is expected to further improve their recovery performance, especially at low measurement rates.

In the present study, an improved weighted MNM (WMNM) algorithm is proposed for the joint CS reconstruction of MECG signals by efficiently exploiting the inter-channel correlation. The proposed weighting strategy intends to prioritize the higher amplitude ECG wavelet coefficients whose indices form the row support of jointly sparse MECG signals during the joint CS-based reconstruction. The insignificant lower amplitude coefficients are de-emphasized simultaneously. These coefficients correspond to the indices that are more likely to fall outside the row support of jointly sparse MECG signals, and therefore are expelled from the row support in the final solution. It enhances the sparseness of the solution and reduces the number of measurements required for accurate recovery. The traditional MNM-based algorithms lack this flexibility. Additionally, a pre-defined weighting rule based on the prior knowledge about MECG wavelet representation is explored that exploits prior structural knowledge about the common support of diagnostically relevant MECG wavelet coefficients to determine the weights.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the MMV-based CS modeling and the WMNM-based recovery of the MECG signals are discussed in Section 2. Experimental results on different databases and the related discussions, including recovery performance analysis, comparative study, and application related issues, are presented in Section 3. The concluding remarks are given in Section 4.

@&#METHODS@&#

In standard practice, MECG signals are recorded in a 12-channel format [9]. Out of these 12-channels, there are eight independent channels: I, II, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6; and the remaining four are derived channels: III, aVR, aVL, aVF. We have processed the eight independent channels in this work because the derived channels can be synthesized using the independent limb leads, I and II. Hereafter, MECG will refer to eight channels instead of 12-channels. The MECG signals are jointly encoded using a sensing matrix at the encoder. The resulting compressed measurements are collected at the decoder where all the ECG channels are simultaneously reconstructed with the help of proposed recovery technique. The compressed measurements can be quantized and Huffman encoded to further enhance the compression efficiency of the system. The main contribution of this work focuses on the joint reconstruction algorithm that uses a weighting strategy to emphasize the clinically important wavelet coefficients while exploiting the underlying inter-channel correlations. The aim is to improve the diagnostic reconstruction quality of ECG signals at a reduced number of measurements. A block diagram is shown in Fig. 2, which illustrates all the important steps involved in the proposed method. The detailed description of the proposed method is given in subsequent subsections.

Multichannel compressed sensing enables simultaneous joint compression and reconstruction of all the ECG channels using an MMV modeling approach. For the MMV modeling, it is required that all signals under the ensemble share a common sparsity profile. In other words, each of the signals should have a common support set. In the case of MECG, each channel is sparsely representable in wavelet domain [6,7] as shown in Fig. 1
                        
                        (a). A similar sparsity structure is evident from the distribution of larger wavelet coefficients (those containing diagnostic ECG information) in each channel as shown in Fig. 1(b). This approximately fulfills the required common sparsity condition for the MMV modeling.

Following the MMV model of CS theory [10], compressed measurements corresponding to all the ECG channels can be obtained as:

                        [3]. Sparse matrices are memory efficient and involve lesser computations, thus help minimize the computational cost at the encoder [7].

The MNM-based algorithms are generally used for joint sparse reconstruction [10]. However, because of their amplitude dependence, a large number of measurements are required for accurate signal recovery. If this dependency could be reduced using a weighting strategy, recovery performance can be substantially improved. In this section, we first discuss MNM as a joint MECG recovery algorithm, followed by a description of its proposed weighted version, the weighted MNM (WMNM). Two different weighting rules are explored for WMNM. In the first case, the weights are based on ℓ2-norm of nonzero rows of 
                           A
                         (adaptive weighted mixed-norm minimization (AWMNM)). In the second case, the weights are chosen based on the a priori information (binary weighted mixed-norm minimization (BWMNM)).

Corresponding to three different sets of values for p and q, i.e., (p, q) = {(1, 1), (2, 1), (∞, 1)}, three cases of (2) are analyzed. In all these cases, the final sparsity inducing-norm is kept the same (i.e., ℓ1-norm), while the inner-norm is varied. The ℓ2-norm promotes denser solutions than the ℓ1- and ℓ∞-norms [10]. Hence, the mixed-norm with 
                           
                              p
                              =
                              2
                              ,
                              q
                              =
                              1
                           
                         results in better joint reconstruction performance and is employed in this work for further studies. Hereafter, the mixed-norm is referred to as a combination of ℓ1- and ℓ2-norms, denoted by ℓ2, 1. The ℓ2, 1-mixed-norm acts as a group-sparsity inducing norm and exploits the fact that the nonzero sparse coefficients of all the ECG channels are naturally grouped together. Dense solution is promoted by taking ℓ2-norm over each row of 
                           A
                         and then the outer ℓ1-norm, i.e., sum of ℓ2-norm of each row, forces the selection of only few rows. Thus, the ℓ2, 1-mixed-norm exploits the inter-channel correlation of the MECG signals while promoting row-sparsity.

The objective function for the convex optimization problem in (2) is modified to incorporate additional MECG information through positive weighting factors

The weighted l
                        2, 1-mixed-norm acts as the weighted l
                        1-norm over the vector resulted after ℓ2-norm of each row of

In this approach, an AWMNM algorithm based on adaptive weighting strategy is proposed. It aims to perform a more democratic penalization of the nonzero rows of joint sparse matrix 
                              A
                           , and thus, reduces the amplitude dependence of the traditional non-weighted l
                           2, 1-mixed-norm. The weights are chosen according to an inverse relation to the ℓ2-norm (i.e., energy) of each row. The nonzero rows with higher energy (corresponding to the low frequency wavelet coefficients) are assigned small weights, while the nonzero rows with lower energy (i.e., high frequency wavelet coefficients) are assigned large weights. The justification for such a weighting is evident from (4). Here, it can be noted that small weights emphasize the nonzero rows associated mainly with the clinically important high amplitude wavelet coefficients. On the other hand, large weights de-emphasize such rows. Therefore, the rows from lower energy subbands (clinically less important) are pushed towards zero and their corresponding indices are more likely to be thrown out of the row-support of the final solution. This, in turn, leads to a row-sparse solution. The weight for the jth row of source matrix

                            the weights become unity, i.e., a case of non-weighting. The parameter ϵ is a small nonzero scalar introduced to make the algorithm stable in the case of zero-valued coefficients. The performance of the algorithm is found to be fairly robust to the choice of ϵ (described later in Section 3.5). A more precise value of ϵ can be obtained by calculating the 10% of standard deviation for the ℓ2-norm of the nonzero rows.

Steps involved in the joint MECG reconstruction through the adaptive weighting are given in the Algorithm 1

                            for all the simulations. Thus, the adaptive weighting strategy produces more focal estimates of the signal as the optimization progresses. Consequently, the reconstruction quality of the MECG signals improves iteratively.

In addition to the iterative reweighting strategy, the weights

                            can also be set on the basis of some prior structural knowledge about the MECG wavelet representation. In this case, the MECG recovery can be done in Step 1 of Algorithm 1. As evident from Fig. 1(a), in the joint sparse approximation of MECG signals in the wavelet domain, most of the ECG features containing the important pathological information fall in the low frequency subbands [16]. The wavelet coefficients in these subbands are always expected to be nonzero. Consequently, the indices corresponding to those entries are highly likely to fall within the row support of jointly-sparse MECG signals. This prior support information can be used to determine a set of pre-defined weights. For n levels of wavelet decomposition, we have considered three low-frequency subbands (An, Dn

                                    n

                           ) as clinically relevant subbands since most of the ECG features lie in these subbands (constituting more than 80% of subband energy) [16]. Small weights are used for the entries corresponding to these subbands in order to preserve the corresponding indices in the row-support of the final solution. The likelihood of having only nonzero wavelet coefficients in other detail subbands is very low (refer Fig. 1(b)). This is because of the low energy and minimal diagnostic contents of these subbands. Hence, relatively large weights are used for the coefficients in rest of the detail subbands. Because of the large weighting factors, the indices corresponding to the insignificant coefficients are kept out of the row support in the final solution. This promotes sparseness of the solution at right positions. At the same time, it also improves the joint recovery without compromising with the diagnostic fidelity.

A simple case of binary weighting has been discussed in this paper. In this case, the weights corresponding to the coefficients in three lower frequency subbands are set to zero, while those corresponding to other detail coefficients are set to unity. This approach is referred to as binary-weighted MNM (BWMNM) in this work. The BWMNM not only makes the recovery non-iterative but also improves the recovery performance as compared to the traditional MNM. In the remaining part of the paper, the AWMNM and the BWMNM are referred to as weighted mixed-norm minimization (WMNM).

The performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is carried out on various publicly available MECG databases, such as PTB, INCART, NSTDB, MIT-BIH [17,18], and CSE [19]. The PTB and INCART contain various diagnostic MECG signals from 290 and 32 patients sampled at 1 kHz and 257 Hz, respectively, with 16-bit resolution. The CSE is a 12-channel database sampled at 500 Hz with 10-bit resolution. Each of these datasets consists of either 12 or 15 channels (including frank leads in the PTB) of ECG signals.

                     . This data-matrix is termed as the data packet. Experiments are performed on 30 such data packets, taken from each of the datasets. The Daubechies-4 (db4) wavelets is employed as the sparsifying bases for the ECG signals. The number of levels in the wavelet decomposition is decided on the basis of sampling frequency and decomposition level relationship suggested in [20]. The compressed measurements are obtained by jointly encoding all the channels through a random sparse binary sensing matrix

                      contains only d number of nonzero values equal to 1 at random positions [7]. The value of d is chosen in accordance with earlier studies [3,6]. These studies suggest a value of

                      in order to have a good trade-off between the signal sensing capability and computational time. Different values of M are used to get varied performances of the proposed algorithm. The results are averaged over 100 trials with different realization of the random sensing matrix \boldsymbolΦ in each trial.

The fraction of the common support [6] is found to be increased by limiting the total number of ECG channels to 8, instead of 15. It increased up to 15% in case of 8 channels as compared to 15 channels. This helps improve the recovery performance further. The rest of the supplementary channels of the standard 12 channels MECG can be synthesized after reconstructing the independent channels at the decoder using following linear relations:

Because of lesser clinical acceptability of the above defined distortion measures [3], we have also employed a few other metrics that are specifically used as diagnostic distortion measures for the ECG signals. These metrics include the weighted diagnostic measure (WDD), wavelet-energy-based diagnostic distortion (WEDD), and quality score (QS) [6,16,21]. The WDD is defined as:

                        where Δβ is the normalized difference between the diagnostic feature vectors of original and reconstructed ECG signals, while Λ is a diagonal weighting matrix. Here, we have considered the duration, amplitude, and slope features for the WDD calculation. These features are concatenated to form the feature vector β. The duration features included the 
                           RR
                         interval, P wave duration, QRS interval, QT interval, PR interval, and QTp
                         interval. For the amplitude features, we took amplitudes of the prominent ECG waves, such as P wave, R wave, T wave, QRS positive amplitude, and QRS negative amplitude. The ST slope is taken as the slope feature. The WEDD metric is defined as:

The retention of the diagnostic features, such as PR interval, QRS interval, ST segment, and R amplitude of the jointly reconstructed MECG signals, is of utmost importance in remote ECG monitoring applications. The objective of this section is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed weighting strategies for improved recovery performance at a low measurement rate.

The MECG signals from the dataset s0043lrem are jointly encoded using the sensing matrix of size 100 × 512. These are reconstructed at a lower number of measurements

                         using the proposed AWMNM with 
                           
                              p
                              =
                              0
                           
                         and 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              3
                           
                         iterations. Reconstruction is also performed using the traditional MNM technique when no weighting is done, i.e., with 
                           
                              p
                              =
                              2
                           
                        . The quantitative values of distortion metrics, PRD, SNR, WEDD, and QS, of different algorithms are listed in Table 1
                         for the comparison purpose. A higher level of distortion can be noted in the reconstructed signals using the traditional method compared to the proposed method. The proposed technique shows a substantial reduction in the distortion level in each channel. The Lead V2 exhibits a maximum reduction in the PRD value, which drops from a value of 
                           
                              31.06
                           
                         to 6.92% (up to 77%). Furthermore, a gain of more than 100% is noted in the values of SNR and QS when joint weighted recovery is done using AWMNM as compared to the non-weighted recovery case. The AWMNM technique exploits the joint correlation of MECG wavelet coefficients while encouraging clinically important wavelet coefficients through weighting. Consequently, the high amplitude wavelet coefficients from the rows of 
                           A
                         are privileged and their support information is preserved in the row-support of the final solution. This helps improve the joint MECG recovery. It is reflected in terms of lower PRD value and higher SNR and QS values, which fall in “good” category reconstruction [3]. The joint recovery performance is also compared with some other reported works in the related area, such as multi-scale CS (MCS) [8], simultaneous greedy analysis pursuit (SGAP) [22], and Bayesian-learning-based work (MSBL-FM) [23]. The proposed method outperforms the aforementioned works in terms of lower reconstruction distortions (refer Table 1).

The superiority of the joint MECG reconstruction obtained by the proposed method is also verified from the clinical point of view using measures, such as WDD and WEDD. Values of WDD, given in Table 2
                        , fall in the “very good” signal reconstruction category for Lead V6 (

                        ) from healthy control (HC) (dataset s0274rem) and myocardial infarction (MI) classes (dataset s0043lrem), respectively [21]. However, “good” category reconstructions are achieved for Lead I in both the classes. The different diagnostic ECG features, which are used to calculate the WDD value are detected and shown in Fig. 3
                         for the original and recovered signals of Lead I from the HC class. These features mainly include the amplitude and duration features. These features are very important diagnostic characteristics for some of the life threatening heart diseases, such as bundle branch block (BBB), MI, etc. Therefore, quantifying the distortions in such features is necessary in order to clinically validate the reconstruction accuracy of the proposed method. These clinical features for both the HC and MI classes are also quantified in Table 2. It is seen that the amplitude features are almost preserved in both the classes, but small deviations are noticeable in the duration features, especially in the case of QTint, PRint
                        , and QTpint
                        . This may be the reason for a slightly higher WDD value obtained in Lead I. The WEDD values (given in Table 1) for most of the channels fall in “good” reconstruction category [16]. A significant performance improvement is also achieved with the use of binary weighting in the BWMNM algorithm as compared to the traditional MNM recovery (discussed in the next section).

The reconstructed waveforms of the jointly recovered MECG signals are shown in Figs. 4
                         and 5
                         for visual evaluation. The original and the reconstructed ECG signals corresponding to first 4096 time points from different channels are plotted together for better visualization. A case of HC is depicted in Fig. 4, while Fig. 5 shows a case of MI signal. For the HC dataset, the characteristic PQRST morphologies have been retained with the exception of a slight alteration at a few points when the AWMNM recovery is employed. On the other hand, severe distortions can be noted in the traditional MNM recovery (encircled in the waveforms). Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows the reconstruction results for the MI class using the traditional MNM and the proposed AWMNM, respectively, at the same number of measurements 
                           
                              (
                              M
                              =
                              100
                              )
                           
                        . In the case of MNM, reconstructed ECG signals lose important clinical features, such as ST-segment, Q-wave, and T-wave (encircled) that are very crucial for detecting AMI progression in a patient. All the diagnostically relevant ECG features have been preserved using the proposed AWMNM method, except Lead II, which shows slight distortion (encircled), possibly due to its high noise content. Therefore, the proposed weighting strategy gives significant improvement in the reconstruction signal quality (verified clinically using WDD) when lesser measurements are available. This helps achieve low data-rate that is quite desirable in resource-constrained applications.

The behavior of output distortion in terms of PRD and parameter p, given by (5), is studied in Fig. 6
                        . The output PRD variations for all the pathological datasets in PTB database are shown in the form of box plot in Fig. 6(a) for different values of p. The edges of the boxes denote the 25th and the 75th percentiles with the central line as the median. The extreme values in the individual box depict the minimum and maximum PRD values obtained at a particular value of p and 
                           
                              M
                              
                              (
                              =
                              120
                              )
                           
                         using different datasets. It can be noted that the overall output distortion increases with an increase in the value of p. This is indicated by the shift in the group median towards higher PRD values as p increases. In Fig. 6(b), the oversampling ratio M/K is plotted against the output PRD at different values of p. Here also, it is quite evident that at small values of p (
                           
                              p
                              =
                              0
                           
                         and 
                           
                              p
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                        ), a lower output distortion is observed, which gradually increases as p is increased. After 
                           
                              p
                              =
                              1
                              ,
                           
                         
                        PRD increases at a faster rate and becomes maximum at 
                           
                              p
                              =
                              2
                           
                         when the weights become unity, i.e., a non-weighting case.

The distortion values in terms of the average PRD in AWMNM recovery for the HC and three other major pathological classes from the PTB database are given in Table 3
                         at measurements 
                           
                              M
                              =
                              150
                           
                        . The class-specific average results are calculated over 52 healthy control, 148 myocardial infarction, 7 hypertrophy, and 15 bundle branch block datasets available in the PTB database in order to analyze the inter-class performance variation of the proposed method. It is quite evident from the readings in Table 3 that the normal MECG signals have less reconstruction error as compared to the pathological cases. This is quite expected as the normal MECG signals are more correlated, and hence, more jointly sparse as compared to the pathological cases. In the latter case, joint sparsity may decrease because of the changes in the ECG morphologies in specific channels, leading to a degradation in the performance. The average results for the arrhythmic databases, such as NSTDB, and INCART are also evaluated. Quantified results are given in Table 3 at different values of M for both the AWMNM and the BWMNM recovery cases.

The performance comparison of the proposed method is done with the state-of-the-art joint sparse recovery algorithms for the joint MECG recovery. These techniques include MNM [11], basis pursuit (BP) [3,4], TMSBL [24], improved smooth l
                        0 (ISL0) [25], and simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) [26]. The comparative results in terms of PRD and SNR, averaged over all the PTB records, are shown in Fig. 7
                        (a) and (b), respectively, at different M and CR values (using 8 bit of quantization).

First, we compare the performance of the proposed WMNM (AWMNM and BWMNM) with its non-weighted counterpart, i.e., the traditional MNM, which is a special case of AWMNM with 
                           
                              p
                              =
                              2
                           
                         and iterations count 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              1
                           
                        . The MNM, as a joint sparse recovery algorithm, was earlier used by Mamaghanian et al. [11] for the joint CS reconstruction of the MECG signals. However, the trend of PRD and SNR in Fig. 7, indicate that both the WMNM methods perform better than the MNM algorithm. The weighting of the jointly correlated coefficients with significant clinical importance grants special privilege to the bases corresponding to those coefficients. Consequently, those coefficients are encouraged to be preserved in all the channels even when lesser signal measurements are available. However, the MNM lacks this attribute as it only leverages the group sparsity leading to degradation in the performance at low measurements. The BP is a classic CS recovery algorithm for the SMV models and is implemented in this work using the SPGL1 software [27]. In the case of MECG signals, BP fails to exploit the inter-channel correlation efficiently, and hence performs poorly. Another algorithm similar to, but relatively faster than BP, is ISL0.

                           Matlab scripts obtained by the first author through private communication.
                         The WMNM makes better utilization of the inter-channel correlation structure of MECG, and therefore, outperforms both the BP and ISL0. Apart from the convex optimization techniques discussed above, greedy algorithm like SOMP is also employed for comparison. This algorithm usually requires more measurements for accurate reconstruction. It was used in [26] for jointly recovering consecutive ECG cycles of the single channel ECG in a joint CS framework. For the multi-channel case, SOMP is outperformed by the proposed methods.

TMSBL is a recently proposed algorithm for the MMV recovery, and is based on the Bayesian learning approach. This technique is known to be very effective, especially when the nonzero rows of the source matrix 
                           A
                         are temporally correlated. It was previously applied to exploit the inter-beat correlation in the single channel ECG [24]. We have analyzed the performance of TMSBL for the MECG recovery. It is implemented in a low noise scenario (SNR > 22 dB) for the PTB database using the source code provided by the authors. In the case of single channel ECG, different heart-beats of the same channel are highly correlated. Consequently, the row vectors of the coefficient matrix 
                           A
                         turn out to be correlated, and the algorithm performs better. But in the case of MECG signals, the temporal correlation in each rows of 
                           A
                         is relatively low. This, in turn, might lead to moderate performance of the TMSBL for MECG signals. In the case of AWMNM, the assigned weights are adaptive in nature, unlike the BWMNM that uses static weights. This produces a more focal estimate of the signal as the algorithm progresses, but at the cost of extra iterations. Thus, it can be concluded that the BWMNM fares better in terms of the recovery speed. On the other hand, the AWMNM is preferable in terms of reconstruction accuracy.

ECG telemonitoring is a resource-constrained application, which requires a low-complexity encoder with minimum energy consumption, and low memory requirements. This section discusses the proposed method from the perspective of such issues.

To keep the computation burden during signal acquisition at minimum, a random sparse binary matrix 
                              Φ
                            is employed in this work. Unlike the densely populated Gaussian matrices, which suffer from heavy computation and memory storage problem in the WBAN applications, the binary sensing matrix offers least computation and faster hardware implementation. Instead of choosing the values of nonzero entries in the column of 
                              Φ
                            equal to ± 1/d 
                           [3], where d is the number of nonzero entries, here binary values (0 or 1) are taken [7]. This saves further computations as the multiplication operations are now replaced with simple additions of the signal coefficients to get the signal measurements without changing the sensing ability of 
                              Φ
                           . This, in turn, helps reduce the energy consumption during signal sensing at the encoder.

Regarding the energy consumption in the wireless data transmission, results shown in Fig. 7(a) indicate that the proposed method can achieve good quality of reconstruction using only 20% of measurements. On the other hand, techniques, such as the BP and MNM need to increase the number of measurements up to 34% in order to meet the same reconstruction quality. The comparative compression performance analysis at 8-bit quantization is also shown in Fig. 7(b). An improved performance can be observed for both AWMNM and BWMNM as compared to most of the techniques. Thus, a higher data reduction (or a lower bit rate) can be achieved using the proposed technique, which results in transmission power savings in WBAN applications.

The computational cost of the proposed method and other existing CS-based methods is studied in terms of average encoding and decoding time of the algorithms for one data packet (
                              
                                 X
                                 ∈
                                 
                                    R
                                    
                                       512
                                       ×
                                       8
                                    
                                 
                              
                           ). All simulations are done on the same platform using MATLAB R2010a environment running on a computer with 3.1 GHz CPU and 4GB RAM. It is to be noted that the encoder is same in all the algorithms being compared. Therefore, all the algorithms take the same average time to encode a data packet. This average encoding time is found to be 0.163 s, 0.257 s and 0.334 s when 
                              
                                 M
                                 =
                              
                            50, 100, and 150, respectively.

The average runtime of the proposed and other existing algorithms in recovering one data packet, is given in Table 4
                            for different number of measurements (M). It can be noted that out of the two proposed WMNM algorithms, AWMNM and BWMNM, the latter has almost the same runtime as the standard MNM since the weights are set a priori. Though, the AWMNM technique performs better than all the other existing algorithms (refer Fig. 7), this performance gain is obtained with a moderate increase in the computational cost. The AWMNM is an iterative algorithm, which solves a WMNM problem in each iteration with updated weights each time. The runtime, therefore, required by the algorithm is approximately tmax
                            times the runtime of the standard MNM algorithm [11]. Here, tmax
                            is the number of iterations used for the joint recovery (in all the simulations 3 iterations are taken). The TMSBL, which performs close to that of the proposed algorithm, is found to be the slowest one in terms of runtime. The SOMP and ISL0 are the fastest algorithms, with the SOMP having least runtime followed by the ISL0. However, both of these algorithms exhibit inferior recovery performances (refer Fig. 7).

From the above studies, it can be concluded that there is a trade-off between the recovery speed and the reconstruction accuracy. The proposed CS framework using the joint WMNM recovery transfers the computational burden from the encoder to the decoder. By using a binary sensing matrix it further reduces the computations involved at the resource-constrained encoder while moderately increasing the computations at the decoder. It is noteworthy that the decoders are usually resourceful since the decoding is performed on high performance computers. Therefore, the computational complexity of the decoder is not an important issue in the case of WBAN-enabled health monitoring applications [7].

The memory requirements of the proposed method are the same as that of the existing standard CS-based works [11], since we have not added any additional steps in the encoding process. We have calculated the memory requirements during the data compression process at the encoder. CS involves a matrix-vector multiplication for the data reduction task [3,7]. Therefore, we need to calculate the memory required to store the sensing matrix 
                              Φ
                           , which is multiplied with the arriving data packets 
                              X
                            in order to compress them [23,28]. Unlike the DWT-based compressors that work in the batch mode, here the complete data packets are not required during the compression process [28]. With

This, in turn, increases the computational burden and the resource cost. However, in the proposed work, a binary sensing matrix is used with the entries being 0s and 1s only. This minimizes the computations (by replacing multiplication operations with additions) and also requires comparatively lesser memory to store. Each entry of

                            memory space of 42kB is required by taking 12 number of 1s (i.e.,

                           ) in each column. In addition to the 42kB memory that is required as read only memory (ROM), the random access memory (RAM) would also be required to temporarily store the compressed measurement vectors just before their transmission [28]. A hardware-based study is done in [23,28] where the standard CS-based single channel and multi-channel compressors are implemented on field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Their results suggest that for a data packet of length

                            (same as that used in this work), CS requires 3kB of RAM for single channel compression. Furthermore, this can be performed in parallel for multi-channel signals. It can be noted that the memory requirements would remain unchanged for all the CS-based algorithms used for comparison. This is because the same sensing matrix 
                              Φ
                            is employed in all the algorithms.

This section highlights the advantages of the joint CS reconstruction (MMV) over the traditional channel-by-channel CS reconstruction (SMV) of the MECG signals [3,6,7]. The comparison is done in terms of the number of measurements and the reconstruction signal quality. In the MMV approach, all the ECG channels corresponding to all the columns of 
                           A
                         are jointly reconstructed using the proposed WMNM technique. On the other hand, in the case of SMV, individual channels are reconstructed separately using the popular l
                        1 minimization, as used in [3,4]. Fig. 8
                         shows the average reconstruction SNR variation with the number of measurements (M) for the MECG signals recovered through both the SMV and MMV approaches. The reconstruction quality is considered to be in “good” category if the SNR value is greater than 22 dB [3,11,21], and this point is marked with “G” in Fig. 8. In SMV, “good” quality reconstruction is achieved at 
                           
                              M

                              ,
                           
                         while the same level of SNR is reached at 
                           
                              M

                         in the case of MMV. This results in saving of the required number of measurements by 40%. Reduced number of measurements can enhance the overall energy efficiency of the system by reducing the computational burden and increasing the compression efficiency of the system [7]. In terms of reconstruction quality, MMV (
                           
                              S

                              =

                         dB) outperforms SMV (

                              =
                              23.1
                           
                         dB) as it gives an absolute improvement of 10% in SNR at 
                           
                              M
                              =
                              250
                           
                        . It is quite clear from the above performance comparison that in the case of spatially correlated signals, like MECGs, the SMV approach may not be suitable and effective. The MMV approach that can exploit this correlation through the proposed WMNM technique is more suited for CS of MECG signals. This also validates the importance of correlation information in multi-channel-based CS ECG systems.

In the MMV approach, the joint recovery technique AWMNM depends on various parameters like ϵ, the weights

                              ,
                              2

                         and the number of iterations t. Therefore, there is a need to study the variation in performance of the algorithm with respect to these parameters. The output PRD for all the channels of MECG is plotted against a wide range of ϵ values in Fig. 9
                        (a). A quite robust performance is achieved in the selected range of values of ϵ. The same can be observed in the given plot where a marginal variation in PRD values (w.r.t. change in ϵ) is noticed in all the channels. For all the results reported in this work, we used 
                           
                              ϵ
                              =
                              0.2
                           
                        . Fig. 9(b) shows the variation in the weights during the optimization procedure at each iteration. For the sake of clarity, variations of first 50 weights only are shown in Fig. 9(b). It can be observed that the weights get optimized at each iteration and attain a saturation level after 2–3 iterations. No further gain in the reconstruction accuracy is achieved, and the output distortion level gets saturated after 2–3 iterations. Hence, the proposed AWMNM approach does not overburden the decoder, and therefore, with a moderate increase in the computational cost, an improved quality of reconstructed MECG signals can be obtained.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, a WMNM-based joint recovery algorithm was proposed for CS-based MECG telemonitoring applications. The ECG signals in different channels of MECG are highly correlated. The shared information across the channels was exploited here to jointly compress and reconstruct all the channels simultaneously. The proposed WMNM technique is based on a weighting strategy that helps maintain the diagnostic quality of reconstructed MECG signals even at higher compression ratios. The weighting scheme is such that it emphasizes clinically important wavelet coefficients across the channels while de-emphasizing those with insignificant information, thus leading to a sparser solution. Joint recovery through the proposed method reduces the number of CS measurements needed for an accurate recovery, or equivalently, improves the joint reconstruction at a given number of measurements. Performance evaluations on various databases showed that the proposed method can jointly recover MECG signals with a wide range of morphologies. Moreover, it was also observed that in the presence of the inter-channel correlated information, joint CS-based approach is more advantageous than the traditional CS-based approaches in terms of improved reconstruction quality at a lower number of measurements. The reduction in the number of measurements directly translates into the reduced volume of data to be transmitted. Higher data compression efficiency and low complexity of the proposed method makes it suitable for energy efficient continuous wireless telemonitoring of MECG signals.
