                  In this paper we present a new approach, based on the Nearest Interval Approximation Operator, for dealing with a multiobjective programming problem with fuzzy-valued objective functions.
                  By the way we have established a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (K.K.T) kind of Pareto optimality conditions, for the resulting interval multiobjective program. To this end, we made use of gH-differentiability of involved interval-valued functions.
                  Two algorithms play a pivotal role in the proposed method. The first one returns a nearest interval approximation to a given fuzzy number. The other one makes use of K.K.T conditions to deliver a Pareto optimal solution of the above mentioned resulting interval program.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many decisions that we make in real life cannot be modeled easily in deterministic terms because of imprecision surrounding involved data. In this connection, the noted philosopher Nietzche was quoted as saying “No one is gifted with immaculate perception”. This has also been well expressed by the Physics Nobel laureate Feynman who once wrote: “When dealing with a mathematical model, special attention should be paid to imprecision in data”. Zadeh ’s incompatibility principle [17] stipulating that: “When the complexity of a system increases, our ability to formulate precise and yet meaningful statement on this system decreases up to a threshold beyond which precision and significance become mutually exclusive characteristics”, is also instructive in this regards.

This gives substance to the study of mathematical models under uncertainty. As probability theory is a matured segment and a familiar territory of mathematics, it is not a surprise that early works on mathematical programming under uncertainty was devoted to situations where randomness is in the state of affairs [1,28,29,40]. Nevertheless, imprecision cannot be equated with randomness. As a matter of fact, there is a qualitatively different type of imprecision (vagueness) which cannot be tackled with probabilistic apparatus [43]. This has rightly led some researchers to embark upon the investigation of ways of integrating fuzzy relations and/or fuzzy quantities into mathematical programming models [23,34,44].

In this paper, we consider a multiobjective programming problem with fuzzy objective functions.

This is an ill-defined problem. Neither solution concepts (like Pareto Optimality) nor existing approaches (like the weighting method), introduced for deterministic multiobjective programming, can be blindly applied.

For these tools to be applied, they should be properly tailored to take into consideration the fuzziness surrounding the problem.

Moreover, existing approaches for solving the above mentioned problem either caricature the reality or are computationally demanding.

We propose here a new approach that do not give a bad reflect of the reality and in the same time yields a computationally tractable deterministic problem.

At the heart of our approach lies the idea of approximating involved fuzzy quantities by their respective nearest interval approximations. This helps avoiding pitfalls due to severe oversimplification of the reality.

The challenging task of singling out a solution of the resulting interval optimization problem is also addressed.

The remaining of the paper unfolds as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief primer on notions of real interval and fuzzy numbers. In section 3, we discuss the concept of the nearest interval approximation of a fuzzy quantity. In Section 4, we present our approach for dealing with a multiobjective programming problem with fuzzy number coefficients. Section 5 is devoted to a numerical example for the sake of illustration.

In Section 6, we give a critical analysis of existing methods for optimization problems with several fuzzy objective functions. Section 7 is devoted to an assessment of our method in comparison with existing ones.

We end up, in Section 8 with some concluding remarks along with perspectives for further research in this field.

This model comes up in several applications including water resources management [9], production planning problems [19], power plant maintenance scheduling [12].

It is not a loss of generality to focus on the case of deterministic constraints. As a matter of fact, the literature is rich of papers addressing the problem of converting fuzzy constraints into crisp ones. See for example [8,33]. (P1) is an ill stated problem due to the presence of several objective functions coupled to the fuzziness surrounding involved data.

Therefore the optimum optimorum does not exist for this problem and we have to seek for some satisficing solution.

Moreover, existing approaches for the deterministic case, like the weighting method cannot be applied blindly. They should be tailored to make them suitable for the fuzzy case.

Here, the original problem is converted into deterministic terms using approximate transformations.

We take advantage of the notion of the nearest interval approximation of a fuzzy number to obtain a suitable approximate of (P1). A solution of this deterministic counterpart is considered as a satisficing solution to (P1).

It is worth to note that the deterministic counterpart of (P1), by our approach, has the same linear or non linear structure as (P1).

The only one difference between (P1) and its counterpart stems in the fact that, while (P1) has fuzzy parameters, its counterpart has interval coefficients.

To find a solution of (P1), we approximate it by the following interval multiobjective program:

                                  is a continuous operator.

Moreover, it has not the inconvenience of deffuzification operators that transform a fuzzy number into a real number, leading to a loss of too much information. More than this, the NIA operator is optimal in the sense that it is among interval approximation operators of a fuzzy member, the one that minimize the distance to the fuzzy number.

In what follows, we introduce the notion of Pareto optimality for (P2). As can be expected this notion depends on the order relation considered on K

                                 ∗). But this contradicts the fact that x
                                 ∗ is LU Pareto optimal of (P2) and we are done.

As (P2) is a good approximation of (P1) we’ll define satisficing solutions of (P1) as follows.□

                                          X is an LU-satisficing solution of (P1) if it is an LU-Pareto optimal solution of (P2).

From Proposition 4.1 we obtain the following result.
                              Proposition 4.2

                                 ∗ 
                                 is an LS-satisficing solution of (P1).
                              

In this section we are going to prove some Karush–Kuhn–Tucker type Pareto optimality conditions for problem (P2).

The conditions are based on gH-differentiability of interval-valued functions (see Section 2.2.3).

                              This means that x

Hence x

                              is an LS-Pareto optimal solution for (P2).

This comes from Theorem 4.1 from Corollary 4.1

From the above discussion we can derive the following algorithm for finding a satisficing solution of (P1).

In this section we illustrate the proposed method by a numerical example.

                     We see that the vector (1,1,1.4,4.1,3,3) is a solution of (§).

Therefore x

                     =(3,3) is a satisficing solution of (P4).
                        Remark 5.1
                        Here we have considered a linear example for the sake of clarity and simplicity of exposition.

If the problem at hand is nonlinear, the resulting problem will be a nonlinear program with interval coefficients and we can apply the algorithm described in Section 4.5.

One may also apply methods from Interval Optimization [25].

Without any claim for exhaustivity, Table 1
                      below provide a classement of main existing approaches for mathematical programs with several fuzzy objective functions.

The methods are mapped against the grid of how fuzziness is dealt with. This reveals strength and weaknesses of methods that in turn, provides some guidance as to which method may be appropriate for a given circumstance.

As can be seen from Table 1, existing approaches for solving multiobjective programming problems with fuzzy objective functions are either effective (see e.g. [3,11,22,24]) or computationally efficient (see e.g. [15,21,31,37]) but not both.

The approach proposed here strikes a balance between the faithful translation of the original fuzzy problem into deterministic terms and the computational attractiveness of the resulting deterministic program.

As a matter of fact, involved fuzzy quantities are not replaced by real values(leading to a big loss of information and a bad caricature of the reality). Rather, they are replaced by intervals that capture essential features of original fuzzy quantities (see Section 3) and that are closest to the corresponding fuzzy quantities in the sense of Definition 3.2. This brings some level of effectiveness to our approach. Computational efficiency of our method is due to the fact that, one has just to solve a simple system of equations rather than complex optimization problems, in order to single out solutions to the resulting problem.

The fact that our approach combines the two features of computational efficiency and effectiveness gives it a huge advantage over existing ones.

We have described an approach that strikes a balance between effectiveness and efficiency while coping with multiobjective programming problems with fuzzy objective functions.

An issue worth investigating is the influence of the K.K.T. coefficients (see Theorem 4.1) on the LU-Pareto optimal solution of (P2).

To this end , one may explore the well known Implicit Theorem (see e.g. [5]) to express x
                     ∗ as a function of λ
                     ∗ and μ
                     ∗.

Case studies should also be carried out, in a way to make transition from theory to practice in this setting.

Another line for further development consists of extending the approach described here to situations where randomness and fuzzines are under one roof in an optimization framework see e.g [26,30,38].

Finally we believe that Decision makers would best be served if from a deep comparative analysis between main fuzzy multiobjective programming methods,a user-friendly Decision Support System (DSS) could be pushed forward. Such a DSS would be of great help advising a Decision maker with the choice of the most suitable method for his problem [18].
