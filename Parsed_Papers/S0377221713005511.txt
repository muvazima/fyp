                  This paper aims to find a faster method for optimal solutions of Feng et al.’s int
                     
                        m

                        n
                      decision making scheme. We first give theoretical characterizations of optimal decision sets. Then we develop a pruning method which filters out those objects that cannot be elements of any optimal decision sets in the beginning. Experimental results have shown that our method has higher efficiency in computing the optimal solutions of this scheme, particularly when we are processing soft sets with a great quantity of data.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     Molodtsov (1999) initiated soft set theory as a new mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainty and vagueness. The theory of soft sets has potential applications in various fields like game theory, operations research, decision making and so on.

Many contributions have been made to soft set theory (Ali, Feng, Liu, Min, & Shabir, 2009; Maji, Biswas, & Roy, 2003) and its applications. Some researchers connected soft sets with algebraic structures such as group and semiring (Aktaş & Çağman, 2007; Feng, Jun, & Zhao, 2008; Jun & Park, 2008; Jiang, Tang, Chen, Wang, & Tang, 2010; Jun, Lee, & Khan, 2010a). Soft sets were also combined and compared with other mathematical theories designed for modeling various types of vague concepts (Feng, Li, Davvaz, & Ali, 2010a; Feng, Liu, Leoreanu-Fotea, & Jun, 2011; Jun, Lee, & Park, 2010b; Maji, Biswas, & Roy, 2001; Majumdar & Samanta, 2010; Yang, Lin, Yang, Li, & Yu, 2009). Maji, Roy, and Biswas (2002) initiated study of soft set based decision making. Since then a lot of work have been done on this subject (Çağman & Enginoğlu, 2010a; Feng, Jun, Liu, & Li, 2010b; Feng, Li, & Leoreanu-Fotea, 2010c; Jiang, Tang, & Chen, 2011; Kong, Gao, Wang, & Li, 2008; Roy & Maji, 2007; Xiao, Gong, & Zou, 2009; Xiao, Li, Zhong, & Yang, 2003). In particular, Çağman and Enginoğlu (2010b) initiated uni–int decision making scheme. Without rough sets (Fan, Liu, & Tzeng, 2007; Liang, Wu, & Zhang, 2006) or fuzzy soft sets, this approach could reduce a large set of alternatives according to the criteria given by decision makers. Recently, Feng, Li, and Çagˇman (2012) proposed a generalized work named int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision making scheme. This method broke some limitations of the uni–int decision making such that the uni–int decision making method became more applicable.

The int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision making method is based on choice value soft sets and ∧-product of choice value soft sets. The construction of these choice value soft sets and their ∧-product is a heavy work to do, particularly when the initial soft sets have large amounts of data. In order to make the int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision making scheme more convenient in real applications, we propose an efficient algorithm for computing optimal int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision sets, which does not need computation of the choice value soft sets and the ∧-product of them. Our basic idea is to filter out at first those elements that cannot be elements of any optimal decision sets.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 makes an introduction to basic concepts needed for this paper. In Section 3, we first give characterizations of optimal decision sets and then develop a new method for solutions of int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision making scheme. Experimental results are proposed in Section 4. At last we conclude this paper and outlook for further research.

In this paper, let U be a finite universe of objects and E be a finite universe of parameters related to objects in U. ℘(U) means the power set of U and ∣W∣ means the cardinality of W.

                        (Molodtsov, 1999) A pair S
                           =(F,
                           A) is called a soft set over U, where A
                           ⊆
                           E and F:
                           A
                           →℘(U) is a set-valued mapping. ∀a
                           ∈
                           A, F(a) is called the a-approximate set of S.

(Maji et al., 2003) Let (F,
                           A) and (G,
                           B) be two soft sets over U. Then (G,
                           B) is called a soft M-subset of (F,
                           A), denoted (G,
                           B)

                            (F,
                           A), if B
                           ⊆
                           A and G(b)=
                           F(b) for all b
                           ∈
                           B. For convenience, we use (F,
                           B) to mean the soft M-subset of (F,
                           A) when B
                           ⊆
                           A.

(Feng et al., 2012) Let S

Suppose S
                           =(F,
                           A) is a soft set over U, u
                           ∈
                           U. By Molodtsov (1999), if u is one maximum point of the choice value function σ
                           
                              S
                           , then u is said an optimal solution of S.

(Maji et al., 2003) If S
                           =(F,
                           A) and T

                           B) are two soft sets over a common universe U, then the ∧-product of S and T, denoted S

Even for the same parameter that both of them are interested in, they may have different opinions. We can help them make a decision with the int

                        Remark 2.1
                        The concepts of choice value soft sets and ∧-product of soft sets are very important for a clear representation of the int

Motivated by the Remark 2.1, in this section we are going to give a new algorithm which provides an optimized procedure for computing optimal decision sets.

                           Theorem 3.1 is a characterization for optimal decision sets of S
                           ∧
                           T. It is implied that
                              
                                 •
                                 
                                    V is equal to the union of optimal decision sets.

The number of optimal decision sets is equal to ∣{[v]
                                       R
                                    ∣v

                                    V}∣.

Different optimal decision sets must be pairwisely disjoint.

                            decision making scheme and the decision making scheme in Definition 2.4 by Molodtsov (1999) can be represented by bringing in a new concept as follows.

Suppose S
                           =(F,
                           A), T

                           B) are two soft sets over U, define the disjoint union of S and T as S
                           ⊔
                           T
                           =(I,
                           C), where
                              
                                 (i)

                                    A}∪{(e,
                                    T)∣e
                                    ∈
                                    B};


                                    I(e,
                                    S)=
                                    F(e), I(e,
                                    T)=
                                    G(e).


                           The union of optimal decision sets of S
                           ∧
                           T is equal to the set of optimal solutions (by 
                           
                              Definition 2.4
                           ) of the disjoint union S
                           ⊔
                           T.
                        

Consider the soft sets S and T in Example 2.1, by Corollary 3.1 it can be inferred from Table 1
                            that the union of optimal decision sets of S
                           ∧
                           T is equal to V
                           ={h
                           1,
                           h
                           2,
                           h
                           3}.

Given a soft set S=(F, A) over U, u in U, the set {e∣u is in F(e)} is called the support of parameters for u.

                           Theorem 3.1 also tells us the connections between the optimal decision sets and the soft M-subset (Π,

By computing the set V, we prunes away those elements that cannot be elements of any optimal decision sets. Inspired by this, we give a pruning method for optimal solutions of the int

                                    3))=(2,2). So there is only one optimal decision set: [h
                                    1]
                                       R

                                    3}.

Therefore, {h
                                    1,
                                    h
                                    2,
                                    h
                                    3} is the optimal decision set with smallest cardinality.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

We used Matlab 7.8.0 (R2009a) to compare the efficiencies of Algorithms 1 and 2. It was implemented using a PC with Win7 64 bite Home Basic operating system, intel Core
                     
                        TM
                      i5 CPU and 4GB RAM. The initial soft sets (F,
                     A) and (G,
                     B) over universe U were simulated by two randomly generated 0–1 matrixes (Çağman & Enginoğlu, 2010a), where the row indexes and collum indexes corresponded to objects in U and parameters in A (B) respectively. ∣A∣ and ∣B∣ were set equal in our experiments. For each pair of initial soft sets (F,
                     A) and (G,
                     B), we solved the int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision making problem by both Algorithms 1 and 2. Let ∣U∣=1000, ∣A∣=100, 200, …, 600. For each size of ∣A∣, we repeated for 20 times. The results of average time (seconds) and standard deviation were listed in Table 2
                     .

From Table 2, it can be inferred that our pruning method was much faster than Algorithm 1. For instance, when ∣U∣=1000, ∣A∣=∣B∣=600, Algorithm 2 was 943.75 (=30.2/0.032) times faster than Algorithm 1 in average.

We plotted the standard deviation bars in Fig. 1
                      with values from Table 2. We chose to use the coefficient of variation (Standard deviation/Average time) to compare the stability of these two algorithms. By computing we found that the coefficient of variation for Algorithm 2 was bigger than that of Algorithm 1 with respect to values from Table 2. Note that the average time values for Algorithm 2 had 2 or 3 order of magnitude lower than Algorithm 1. This might affect the coefficient of variation for Algorithm 2. Let ∣A∣=∣B∣=400, ∣U∣=5000, 10,000, 15,000, for each ∣U∣ we repeated Algorithm 2 for 20 times, the corresponding coefficients of variation were 0.061, 0.042 and 0.016. As shown in Table 2, when ∣A∣=∣B∣=400, ∣U∣=1000, experiments showed that the coefficient of variation for Algorithm 1 was equal to 0.019 (=0.239/13.1). So it was implied that Algorithm 2 tended to become more stable when the input size got larger.

Experiments showed that our computer could not solve the int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision making problem by using Algorithm 1 when ∣U∣=1000, ∣A∣=1000. This was because that Algorithm 1 was designed to compute all of the choice value soft sets and the int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision sets. Therefore, much more memory space and time were needed than our Algorithm 2. Let ∣U∣=10,000, ∣A∣=10,000, we repeated the Algorithm 2 for 20 times. It cost about 4.1 s in average. So Algorithm 2 had stronger ability for soft sets with a great quantity of data.

However, experiments showed that our computer could not solve the int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision making problem by using Algorithm 2 when ∣U∣=10,000, ∣A∣=20,000. This was due to the limitation of our computer memory.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In the paper by Feng et al. (2012), characterization of optimal int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision set is not investigated. In this paper we succeed in doing this. This enables us to make a faster implementation of the int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision making scheme. There does exist some bad side effect when using Algorithm 2. We may lose information like those objects which may be elements of some suboptimal decision sets. When the input size is not big, Algorithm 1 is better at this point since all the int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision sets are figured out and easy to access. Nonetheless, our algorithm can be easily adapted for computing suboptimal decision sets by changing the set V.

Our potential future work will focus on: (1) We will extend our method to the situation in which the soft sets are incomplete. (2) We will adapt our method for the situation when the soft sets data are distributed over the network. (3) Feng et al. have connected soft sets with rough set theory (Feng et al., 2010a; Feng et al., 2011). So we will discuss the relationship between the int
                     
                        m
                     –int
                     
                        n
                      decision making scheme and rough-set based data analysis and decision making methods (Liang et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2007;Fan, Liau, & Liu, 2011; Fortemps, Greco, & Slowinski, 2008; Feng et al., 2011).
