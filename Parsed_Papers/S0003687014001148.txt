                  American standard ASTM F2732 estimates the lowest environmental temperature for thermal comfort for cold weather protective clothing. International standard ISO 11079 serves the same purpose but expresses cold stress in terms of required clothing insulation for a given cold climate. The objective of this study was to validate and compare the temperature ratings using human subject tests at two levels of metabolic rates (2 and 4 MET corresponding to 116.4 and 232.8 W/m2). Nine young and healthy male subjects participated in the cold exposure at 3.4 and −30.6 °C. The results showed that both standards predict similar temperature ratings for an intrinsic clothing insulation of 1.89 clo and for 2 MET activity. The predicted temperature rating for 2 MET activity is consistent with test subjects' thermophysiological responses, perceived thermal sensation and thermal comfort. For 4 MET activity, however, the whole body responses were on the cold side, particularly the responses of the extremities. ASTM F2732 is also limited due to its omission and simplification of three climatic variables (air velocity, radiant temperature and relative humidity) and exposure time in the cold which are of practical importance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the most important thermal properties of cold weather protective clothing is insulation. European standard, EN342: Protective clothing – Ensembles and garments for protection against cold, specifies the protection offered by the clothing. It states that the insulation value shall be marked on the clothing (EN 342, 2004). In the USA, however, this is often expressed as a temperature rating on product labels and in product descriptions in catalogs (McCullough et al., 2009, ASTM F2732, 2011). In Europe, the temperature ratings on sleeping bags are also standardized (EN 13537, 2002). Compared to stating the insulation value, putting the temperature on clothing labels is an alternative and easier way for users to understand. The ultimate goal of both standards is to provide protection and thermal comfort for users.

American standard ASTM F2732 (2011) estimates the lowest environmental temperature for thermal comfort for cold weather protective clothing for two physical activity levels (2 and 4 metabolic equivalent (MET), 1 MET = 3.5 ml O2/kg/min = 58.2 W/m2) in cold environments based on measured clothing insulation and human heat balance model. International standard, ISO 11079 (2007): Ergonomics of the thermal environment – Determination and interpretation of cold stress when using required clothing insulation (IREQ) and local cooling effects – serves the same purpose but expresses cold stress in terms of required clothing insulation for a given cold climate condition (air and radiant temperatures, humidity, air velocity), work rate (including walking or work created air movements) and air permeability of clothing, or duration limited exposure (DLE, D
                     lim.) when clothing insulation is known. At very low temperatures and low activity levels, IREQ becomes high. If the clothing insulation does not provide such high insulation, indicating that a person cannot sustain this cold stress for 8 h, then a recommended maximal exposure time, i.e. DLE (in hours), is calculated. The IREQ equations are open and it is also possible to determine temperature ratings when clothing insulation is known. As both standards are based on heat balance equations, it would be of interest to compare them. The comparison was partly carried out by a recent study on the influence of different ways of wearing clothing on clothing insulation and temperature rating predictions (Li et al., 2012).

In comparison with ISO 11079, ASTM F2732 is based on environment conditions with a number of assumptions and limitations (McCullough et al., 2009). The effects of radiant temperature and wind are not used in the heat balance model. Radiant temperature is assumed to be equal to air temperature. Wind and pumping effect are not taken into account. An average of 50% relative humidity is used in the model. The duration of cold exposure has not been taken into consideration either.


                     Holmér (1984) introduced IREQ for the analysis of cold stress, based on which the international standard ISO 11079 was developed in 1993, and the latest ISO version was released in 2007 (ISO 11079, 2007), and an updated web IREQ (version 4.2) was available from 2008 (Nilsson and Holmér, 2009), which provides a fully operational online program for calculation of IREQ and D
                     lim. The method used for the calculation of heat balance is the same as in the standard. Users are not only able to calculate IREQ and D
                     lim values, but are also able to view the open source code and download a copy that can be run on any personal computer with JavaScript installed. This has made the close scrutiny of the program possible in the scientific community. Recently, d'Ambrosio Alfano et al. (2013) conducted an in-depth analysis of IREQ program and found incongruities and errors in the web based program leading to a systematic overestimation of the duration limited exposure. However, they have also pointed out that the presence of the errors and inconsistencies only slightly affects the required insulation values, which indicates that the errors may be mainly related to the clothing insulation and related heat transfer through clothing when calculating DLE, as the calculation of required insulation values are based on climatic conditions and metabolic rates. Earlier versions of the standard (ISO/TR 11079:1993, ISO/CD 11079:2001) were validated by field studies (Griefahn, 2000), wearing trials and manikin measurements (Holmér et al., 2003), and human subject tests (Kuklane et al., 2007b).

Since the thermophysiological responses to cold are complex; independent validation and continuous improvements of the models are needed (Holmér, 1995). Cold environments represent a challenge to the human heat balance and protection. More studies are required to explore the interaction between thermal comfort perception and heat exchange in cold environments (Holmér, 2004). A laboratory validation of EN 13537 on sleeping bags has been recently reported (Lin et al., 2013). In contrast with the temperature ratings for sleeping bags, physical activities while wearing cold weather protective clothing play a more important role in determining the temperature ratings for thermal comfort. The first version of ASTM F2732 (2009) included only one level activity of 2 MET. The latest version has also incorporated 4 MET activity. The increase of physical activity level means a prediction of much lower temperature rating for clothing with the same insulation. Whether the increase of physical workload and metabolic rate can maintain heat balance and thermal comfort in extremely cold environments needs to be further studied and validated. Therefore, the objective of this study was to validate and compare the prediction of temperature ratings by both standards using human subjects at two levels of metabolic rates (116.4 and 232.8 W/m2), and to provide further evidence to improve the standards.

@&#METHODS@&#

The cold protective clothing ensemble including cold weather outer garments and base ensemble 1 (ASTM F2732, 2011) was used in the study.

Base ensemble 1 consisted of the following garments:
                           
                              1)
                              Shirt: Swiss army “Gnägi” long-sleeve 100% cotton underwear shirt (∼320 g) and trousers (∼290 g), R
                                 ct = 0.024 m2 °C/W, size 52. This was the same type of underwear used in the EU project “THERMPROTECT” (Kuklane et al., 2007a,b).

Men's underwear briefs: Taiga Polartec, Sweden.

Men's socks: Ullfrotté no. 976 (400 g/m2, R
                                 et = 0.087 m2 °C/W). These were the same type of socks (type 1) used in the EU project “Subzero” (Kuklane et al., 2007b).

Athletic shoes: sneakers (Arbesko AB) used in the EU project “Subzero”.

Gloves: Hestra wind stopper fleece fabric gloves used in the EU project “Subzero”, 295 g/m2.

Hat: Taiga no. 25928 Rohn, Polartec, fleece hat used in the EU project “Subzero”.

The cold weather outer jacket and trousers (Leijona, R
                           ct: 0.183 and 0.123 m2 K/W, with membrane, size 52) used in the EU project “Subzero” (outer garment 1), were dressed on top of the base ensemble 1.

The thermal insulation was measured on the thermal manikin Tore with 17 individually controlled (heating and measuring) zones in climatic chamber according to ISO 15831 (2004) on a standing manikin. Parallel calculation method was used for insulation calculation. Air temperature was 21.9 °C for air layer measurements, 12.4 °C for base ensemble and cold weather ensemble insulation tests. Relative humidity was 38%, air velocity 0.43 ± 0.12 m/s. The measurements on the thermal manikin in each condition were replicated 3–5 times. Average values were used for the calculation of the thermal insulation.

Nine young and healthy male subjects participated. Their age, body height, weight, and body mass index (BMI = weight (kg)/height (m)2) were 24.1 ± 2.6 (mean ± SD) years, 1.81 ± 0.05 m, 74.5 ± 6.6 kg, and 22.8 ± 1.5 kg/m2. BMI was particularly controlled in a narrow range. The subjects had previous experience of living in cold climates (e.g. in Nordic countries) for more than one year, and did not have any history of cold injury, cold related sensitivity or asthma. The subjects were not dependent on any medicine. They were asked not to drink alcohol and not to do exercises 24 h before the experiment, not to smoke, and to refrain from drinking coffee and tea 2 h before the test. Written information about the study was given to the subjects before they came to the laboratory. The first time when the subjects visited the laboratory, they were also given more detailed information about the tests and relevant equipment, sensors, etc. A written informed consent form was signed by each subject before the tests. The tests were conducted during winter season (Nov/Dec 2012). A pre-test for each participant walking on treadmill from slow walking to fast walking speed with the same clothing was performed. Oxygen uptake (VO2) was measured continuously using MetaMax© (CORTEX Biophysik GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) to determine their individual relationships between walking speed and metabolic rate. Thereafter, their individual walking speeds to produce 116.4 W/m2 and 232.8 W/m2 were used in the two test conditions with each test lasting for 90 min in the climatic chamber. The average walking speeds over the nine subjects were 2.0 and 5.8 km/h respectively for the two activities.

Two air temperatures (3.4 and −30.6 °C) based on the measured insulation for the two physical activity levels were calculated according to the ASTM standard (see Eqs. (3) and (4), and Section 4.4) then used for experimental validation on the human subjects. Air velocity was kept the same (0.4 m/s) as in the clothing insulation measurements on the thermal manikin. The subjects wore the same cold weather protective clothing as measured on the thermal manikin except that two pairs of the same socks were used for all nine subjects. Hestra wind stopper fleece fabric gloves were used for 5 subjects at 3.4 °C, 4 subjects at −30.6 °C, and thicker cross country ski mittens (727 g/m2) with micro fleece lining were used for 4 subjects at 3.4 °C, 5 subjects at −30.6 °C.

The following schematic flowchart shows the study protocol and measurements (Fig. 1
                           ). During preparation, clothes, equipment, and subjects were weighed separately. The rectal temperature (T
                           rec) sensor (YSI-401) was inserted by the subjects at a depth of 10 cm above the anal sphincter. Skin temperature (T
                           sk) sensors (thermistors ACC-001; Yellow Springs Instrument, OH, USA, accuracy ±0.1 °C) were taped on the forehead and left side of the body on the upper arm, forearm, hand, little finger, chest, scapula, thigh, calf, and little toe. After preparation and weighing, the subject entered the climatic chamber. The subjects walked on a treadmill for 90 min at the speed determined in the pre-test (Fig. 2
                           ).

The core body temperature and skin temperatures at 10 sites were continuously recorded by a LabView program (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) at 15-second intervals. Subjects rated their whole body, face, hands and feet thermal sensations (4 very hot, 3 hot, 2 warm, 1 slightly warm, 0 neither hot nor cold, −1 slightly cool, −2 cool, −3 cold, −4 very cold), and whole body, face, hands, and feet thermal comfort (0 comfortable, 1 slightly uncomfortable, 2 uncomfortable, 3 very uncomfortable) at the beginning and each 10th minute thereafter throughout the test. The mean skin temperature (T
                           sk) of the subjects was calculated below according to Gagge and Nishi's 8-point equation (ISO 9886:2004; Gagge and Gonzalez, 2011). Extra sensors on little finger and little toe were added in order to record the temperature changes of peripheral extremities in the cold.

The calculated temperature ratings (2.3 and 1.6 °C) for 2 MET activity according to both standards were very similar. For 4 MET activity, the calculated temperature rating based on standard ISO 11079 was about 6 °C warmer than that calculated based on ASTM F2732. The predictions of comfort temperature ratings based on intrinsic insulation 1.0, 3.0 and 4.0 clo were also calculated for comparison (Table 1
                            and Fig. 3
                           ).

The mean rectal temperatures in two cold environments at work intensities corresponding to 2 and 4 MET were relatively stable throughout 90 min exposure although it was slightly higher in the cold at −30.6 °C and 4 MET activity. However, the mean skin temperature in the cold at −30.6 °C was about 5 °C lower than that in the cold at 3.4 °C, and it was continuously dropping during the test period (Fig. 4
                        ).

The little toe temperature in the cold environment at −30.6 °C was about 10 °C lower than that at 3.4 °C at the end of 90 min exposure (Fig. 5
                        ). Most of the time, the toe skin temperature was below 18 °C when the air temperature was at −30.6 °C.

The little finger temperature was about 15 °C lower in the cold at −30.6 °C than that at 3.4 °C when wearing gloves (Fig. 6
                        ). The mean little finger temperature among the subjects fluctuated most of the time between 5 and 10 °C when used gloves at −30.6 °C.

Similar temperature changes on the hand as on the little finger were observed, but to a lesser extent (Fig. 7
                        ).

The whole body thermal sensation was in thermo neutral condition when ambient air temperature was at 3.4 °C (Fig. 8
                        ). The feet felt a little warmer towards the end of the exercise in the cold. In contrast, the thermal sensation of the face was on the cooler side. The thermal sensations of hand with mittens were warmer than those with gloves.

The whole body, feet, face and hand with mittens felt generally comfortable, but the rating score for the hands with gloves was about 0.5, indicating some deviations from just comfortable sensation (rating score = 0) (Fig. 9
                        ).

At −30.6 °C, the whole body thermal sensation stayed below −1 (Fig. 10
                        ), which was also evidenced by the mean skin temperature (ca. 27 °C). The thermal sensation of the hands with gloves was cold, which was also reflected by the measured hand temperature at about 15 °C. The thermal sensation of the face was also on the cold side. However, when mittens were worn, the thermal sensation of the hands became thermoneutral. The feet felt also thermoneutral.

Thermal comfort sensation of the whole body became more and more uncomfortable as the exposure duration increased in the cold at −30.6 °C (Fig. 11
                        ), particularly, the hands with gloves. The face felt uncomfortable. The thermal comfort of the hands with mittens was quite stable.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The main purpose of this study was to compare comfort temperature ratings predicted by ASTM F2732 and ISO 11079 standards and to validate the temperature ratings using human subjects. Both standards for thermal comfort are mainly based on comfort criteria for indoor conditions (Fanger, 1970; Holmér, 2004). As we can see from Table 1 and Fig. 3, the predicted temperature ratings for a range of clothing insulation are in general comparable in the condition of low air velocity (0.4 m/s) and low metabolic rate (116.4 W/m2) despite some problems of ISO 11079 as observed by d'Ambrosio Alfano et al. (2013). In case of stronger wind, the difference between the two predictions could be larger. In the low air velocity condition, for intrinsic clothing insulation I
                        
                           cl
                         = 1.89 clo and 3.0 clo at 2 MET activity level, the predicted temperature ratings are quite similar. However, for 1.89 clo and 4 MET activity, it differs about 6 °C (−30.6 vs. −24.5 °C). This is probably mainly due to the fact that, in ASTM F2732 standard, air velocity including walking generated air movement effects on the convective heat loss from the human body has not been taken into consideration. As evidenced from the thermophysiological responses and perceived thermal sensations and thermal comfort from this study, the predicted temperature rating (−24.5 °C) based on ISO 11079 seems to be more reasonable. Similar predictions (warmer temperature) according to ISO 11079 can be seen for intrinsic clothing insulation 3.0 and 4.0 clo at 4 MET activity level. However, for 1.0 clo and 4 MET activity, ISO 11079 predicted 6 °C colder temperature than ASTM F2732. ISO 11079 does not apply to intrinsic clothing insulation 1.0 clo and 2 MET activity because the predicted temperature rating is above 10 °C. For 4.0 clo and 2 MET activity, the predicted temperature rating by ISO 11079 is about 6 °C lower than that by ASTM F2732. It seems that the discrepancy between the predictions by the two standards is not consistent. The difference cannot be explained only by air velocity, activity intensity and related walking generated air movement. Further investigation is needed.

Another main difference between ASTM F2732 and ISO 11079 is that the latter is based on eight-hour exposure. However, ASTM F2732 does not explicitly describe the consideration of exposure duration. In fact, if the time factor is not considered, the prediction of precise temperature ratings is not absolutely necessary. For a short period of exposure in the cold, for example a few minutes to wait for a bus, cold weather clothing with intrinsic insulation of 2 clo can be used in the environment at +10, 0 or −10 °C. The short duration of exposure will not affect noticeably the whole body heat balance.

The body core temperatures were not affected and were relatively stable in both conditions. Nevertheless, the mean skin temperature was at about 32.0 °C in the condition of ambient air temperature 3.4 °C and 2 MET activity, which was at the borderline of the “low physiological strain” (T
                        
                           sk
                         = 35.7 – 0.0285 * M = 35.7 − 0.0285 * 116.4 (W/m2) = 32.4 °C) according to general whole body thermo neutral condition of ISO 11079 (2007). However, at air temperature −30.6 °C and 4 MET, the mean skin temperature was about 5 °C lower than the thermo neutral state, but still a little higher than the “high physiological strain” (T
                        
                           sk
                         = 33.34 − 0.0354 * M = 33.34 − 0.0354 * 232.8 (W/m2) = 25.1 °C) based on ISO 11079 (2007), which indicates the predicted comfort temperature rating for 4 MET activity according to ASTM F2732 is on the cold side. This result is also in close agreement with and supported by perceived whole body thermal sensation and thermal comfort (Figs. 10–11) although the subjects did not feel very cold and very uncomfortable. In cold environments, it is not unusual that skin temperatures at different sites of the body are non-uniform. Thermal sensation and comfort are related to both mean skin temperature and local skin temperatures. The thermal perception and cold detection threshold is shifted to lower skin temperatures in cold environments than in thermal neutral environments (Holmér, 2004; Mäkinen et al., 2004).

Although ASTM F2732 emphasizes on the whole body thermal comfort, the provision of sufficient protection for extremities is also important. If users do not feel comfortable or cannot tolerate the cold in their extremities, they may stop working. Previous studies showed that the introduction of limit criteria for extremity cooling is necessary to enhance a complete evaluation of cold stress (Gavhed and Holmér, 1998). This study showed that the mean little finger temperature (between 5 and 10 °C) when used gloves at −30.6 °C was much lower than the “high strain” local cooling criteria (15 °C) as specified in ISO 11079 (2007). The fluctuation of the little finger temperature might be attributed to arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) in the distal parts of the extremities, considerable individual differences in the onset of vasoconstriction (Vanggaard et al., 2012) and cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) in fingers (Daanen, 2003). When the finger skin temperature drops below 14 °C, finger dexterity could be severely impaired (Daanen, 2009). Therefore, even though the walking speed (average 5.8 km/h) and metabolic rate (232.8 W/m2) was high in a lower air temperature environment, the same gloves provided neither thermal comfort nor sufficient protection for peripheral extremities. Pain sensation on fingers occurred at least for one subject at −30.5 °C although the pain sensation was not systematically recorded. Thus, the insulation of gloves should be increased with the decrease of air temperatures. Mittens used at air temperature 3.4 °C provided sufficient protection for fingers with temperature being above the “low strain” local cooling criteria (24 °C). The hand skin temperature when wearing gloves and at ambient temperature −30.6 °C stayed at the threshold level of “high strain” local cooling (15 °C) as specified in ISO 11079 (2007), which further demonstrates that a higher insulation for the fingers, hands and toes are required in extremely cold environments even though the metabolic rate is high. The toe temperature dropped during the first 15 min in the condition of −30.6 °C, and then in both environmental conditions it increased continuously because the subjects were walking on the treadmill so that the lower extremities had better heat production and blood circulation. Our earlier studies showed similar low toe temperature and high insulation requirement for the toes for sleeping bags (Lin et al., 2013). These results on the extremities are largely consistent with perceived thermal sensations and thermal comfort except that the little toe temperature was rather low in the condition at −30.6 °C. It should be noted that the little toe and little finger are the most sensitive regions of the feet and hands, probably due to a larger surface area to mass ratio and faster heat loss. It is possible that the recorded temperatures on the little toe and little finger are not in a complete agreement with the thermal sensation and thermal comfort of the whole feet and hands.

The total body weight loss, moisture accumulated in the clothing and the moisture evaporated including respiratory water loss were higher at −30.6 °C than at 3.4 °C because of higher metabolic rate (232.8 W/m2), higher respiration rate and probably higher skin moisture diffusion although with no regulatory sweating (ISO 11079, 2007).

A limitation of the study was that the ambient air temperature for 2 MET physical activity was controlled at 3.4 °C rather than 2.3 °C as calculated according to ASTM F2732 based on measured insulation on the manikin although one degree air temperature difference might not have caused too much impact on the results. Furthermore, the predictions according to web based ISO 11079 have resulted in a range of temperature ratings with 1–2° differences for the same clothing insulation and physical activity (Table 1). The main purpose of this study was to validate if the temperature ratings based on ASTM F2732 (2011) were valid for subjects' thermal comfort and heat balance of the whole body. During the first couple of tests, too low temperatures were observed on the subjects' hands and fingers. Therefore the thicker mittens were also introduced in the study to compare the protection for the hands and fingers in the extremely cold environment. However, the number of subjects using the gloves and mittens respectively was limited in this study. More tests of the effects of the gloves and mittens on the thermal sensation and thermophysiological responses of the extremities are needed.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Both ASTM F2732 and ISO 11079 standards predict similar temperature ratings for an intrinsic clothing insulation of 1.89 clo and 2 MET activity. For higher physical activities, higher air velocity and walking generated air movement, the prediction of comfort temperature ratings differs more since ASTM F2732 does not consider air velocity and pumping effects in the temperature rating prediction.

When the intrinsic thermal insulation of the cold weather protective clothing is 1.89 clo, the predicted temperature rating for 2 MET activity is valid according to test subjects' thermophysiological and subjective responses. For 4 MET activity, however, the whole body thermal sensation and thermal comfort are on the cold side, particularly the responses of the extremities. The predicted temperature rating is too low for thermal comfort. Although the core temperature is table, heat loss from the body continues because the mean skin temperature is low and drops continuously. Therefore, the predicted temperature rating may put users at risk for an eight-hour work shift. In contrast, the predicted temperature rating according to ISO 11079 seems to be more reasonable based on this study.

For a given total insulation, the temperature rating will decrease with the increase of activity level. However, special attention needs to be paid to extremities. The thermal insulation for peripheral extremities should be increased with the decrease of air temperature particularly in extremely cold environments even though the physical work intensity is high. The ASTM standard has indicated that localized cooling and discomfort can occur on different parts of the body. However, the local cooling is not further specified. In addition, the application of the ASTM F2732 is limited because of its omission and simplification of three climatic variables (air velocity, radiant temperature and relative humidity) and exposure time factor in the cold which are of practical importance. When these factors change, the cold weather protective clothing will not provide predicted thermal comfort and protection.
