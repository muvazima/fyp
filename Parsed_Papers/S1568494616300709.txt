                  This paper presents Fuzzy and Ant Colony Optimization Based Combined MAC, Routing, and Unequal Clustering Cross-Layer Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (FAMACROW) consisting of several nodes that send sensed data to a Master Station. FAMACROW incorporates cluster head selection, clustering, and inter-cluster routing protocols. FAMACROW uses fuzzy logic with residual energy, number of neighboring nodes, and quality of communication link as input variables for cluster head selection. To avoid hot spots problem, FAMACROW uses an unequal clustering mechanism with clusters closer to MS having smaller sizes than those far from it. FAMACROW uses Ant Colony Optimization based technique for reliable and energy-efficient inter-cluster multi-hop routing from cluster heads to MS. The inter-cluster routing protocol decides relay node considering its: (i) distance from current cluster head and that from MS (for energy-efficient inter-cluster communication), (ii) residual energy (for energy distribution across the network), (iii) queue length (for congestion control), (iv) delivery likelihood (for reliable communication). A comparative analysis of FAMACROW with Unequal Cluster Based Routing [33], Unequal Layered Clustering Approach [43], Energy Aware Unequal Clustering using Fuzzy logic [37] and Improved Fuzzy Unequal Clustering [35] shows that FAMACROW is 41% more energy-efficient, has 75â€“88% more network lifetime and sends 82% more packets compared to Improved Fuzzy Unequal Clustering protocol.
