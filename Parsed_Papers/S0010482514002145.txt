                  We analyzed the voltage fluctuations of the membrane potential manifested along the inter-spike segment of a pacemaker neuron. Time series of intracellular inter-spike voltage fluctuations were obtained in the current-clamp configuration from the F1 neuron of 12 Helix aspersa specimens. To assess the dynamic or stochastic nature of the voltage fluctuations these series were analyzed by Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), providing the scaling exponent α. The median α result obtained for the inter-spike segments was 0.971 ([0.963, 0.995] lower and upper quartiles). Our results indicate a critical-like dynamic behavior in the inter-spike membrane potential that, far from being random, shows long-term correlations probably linked to the dynamics of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the membrane potential, thereby endorsing the occurrence of critical-like phenomena at a single-neuron level.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent decades, several efforts in the study of the dynamics of neural activity seeking to understand the interaction between the environment and the internal control mechanisms of neurons have been performed. A fractal-like behavior (1/f) in the temporal fluctuations for the occurrence of action potentials, or inter-spike time intervals, collected from extracellular recordings of spontaneous electrical activity of different types of neurons has been found; identifying, as well, that this behavior is linked to the dynamic frequency of depolarization [1–4], neural facilitation or plasticity, and signal transmission [5,6]. Also, a complex behavior of the membrane voltage fluctuations in nerve fibers has been detected and these fluctuations have been studied to assess encoded information by long-term memory processes [7,8].

Early studies suggested that intracellular recordings of the membrane voltage fluctuations in nerve fibers can be related to thermal movements generated by the flow of potassium and sodium ions through the plasma membrane [9,10]. Contrastingly, other experiments indicated that these fluctuations are rather due to structural changes in the voltage-dependent potassium channels [11–13]. Furthermore, other authors have shown theoretically and experimentally that ionic channels show dynamic internal movements and continuous changes of conformational states with long-term memory [14–18]. Besides, the inter-spike membrane potential of neurons is modified by the activation of different mechanisms such as the synaptic transmission, the activation of ionic channels, and the modulation of cytoplasmic free calcium concentration

                     , which all modulate the frequency of occurrence of action potentials [19,20]. Thus, we hypothesized that the intracellular voltage fluctuations of the inter-spike segment present non-random dynamics. Accordingly, in this research we analyzed the intracellular voltage fluctuations of the membrane potential manifested along the inter-spike segment of the Helix aspersa F1 pacemaker neuron, which is involved in the innervation of sensory organs like the osfradio [21]. Our results here indicate a critical-like dynamic behavior that, far from being random, shows fractal-like correlations probably as an expression of the dynamics of the mechanisms involved in regulating the membrane potential.

The subesophageal ganglion cell identified as F1 of the H. aspersa specimen was used in this study owing to its depolarization pattern, topographical location and straightforward manipulation [22,23]. Some of the main mechanisms that generate its electrical activity are well known as it becomes the case for the calcium-dependent potassium channels (BK, SK), voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv), sodium and chlorine channels (Na+, Cl−) [24–30], voltage-gated calcium of L-type channels, HCN4 channels, and G protein-activated inwardly-rectifying potassium channels [31]. Furthermore, within the main mechanisms considered to involve in establishing the inter-spike membrane potential are SK channels, HCN4 channels, and G protein-activated inwardly-rectifying potassium channels [32–34]. In addition, the largest neurons of H. aspersa such as the F1 cell are known to present 8 synaptic inputs [59].

The ganglia used were exposed to type XIV protease (Sigma-Aldrich) in a concentration of 5mg/10ml for 8min. Afterwards the action of the enzyme was stopped by washing the preparation with standard ringer solution and the connective tissue sheath that covers the neurons was removed by mechanical microdissection.

Borosilicate based glass capillaries were used once stretched with a DKI 700-C puller device (2mm diameter wall with filament). The electrodes were filled with 3M KCl solution giving a resistance of 5–10MΩ. The ganglia were perfused with the Ringer solution with the following composition: NaCl 75mM, KCl 4mM, CaCl2 10mM, MgCl2 5mM, Hepes 5mM, and pH 7.5 was adjusted with NaOH to a concentration 1M. All salts were provided by J.T. Baker brand.

Intracellular recordings were performed in the current-clamp configuration using a Dagan 8500 amplifier, and the voltage tracings were monitored on a Tektronik oscilloscope. For the acquisition and visualization of the data a Digidata 1200 A/D interface (Axon Instruments) was employed. A sampling frequency of 1kHz was used, and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was estimated at 27.7dB. This measure was obtained by dividing the root-mean-square (RMS) values of a typical inter-spike segment and the noise generated from the setup (
                        Fig. 1).

To characterize and compare the noise generated by our setup with the dynamics of the inter-spike segment, 10 data series containing an average of 340±10 samples before (control) and after introducing the electrode into the F1 neuron of one specimen were obtained (
                        Fig. 2, left).

To further study the voltage fluctuations in the membrane potential of the inter-spike segment, 12 additional specimens were used, and for each F1 neuron of these specimens all segments (from 16 to 20) containing an average of 340±10 samples were considered (
                        Fig. 3, left). The suitability of these numbers of samples is in accordance with previous studies estimating the scaling exponent from short segments of synthetic fractal-like data [35].

The inter-spike segments were then analyzed with DFA as described below to obtain the scaling exponent α. About 18 scaling exponents per neuron were obtained, which were averaged to obtain a representative scaling exponent of the dynamics present in the voltage fluctuations of the inter-spike segment. This procedure was performed for each of the 12 specimens studied.

Numerical control groups involving segments with approximately 340 samples were also constructed to compare the dynamics presented in the inter-spike segments; these groups were obtained using either random permutations of the same inter-spike segments or synthetic fractal-like data (1/f) generated by the spectral synthesis approximation [36]. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used for the statistical comparisons because the scaling exponents α obtained from the analysis of voltage fluctuations of the inter-spike segments did not present a normal distribution (significance level P<0.05).

The Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) has proven useful to explore long-range correlations in time series [37]. This method provides a quantitative parameter called the scaling exponent α that is estimated as follows.

The original voltage fluctuations time series is numerically integrated and its mean subtracted.

The median α results obtained with DFA for the voltage fluctuations of the noise before the electrode which were introduced (control) into the cell were 0.506 ([0.459, 0.529] lower and upper quartiles), 1.015 ([0.871, 1.151]) for the inter-spike segment, and 0.571 ([0.516, 0.598]) for the noise after the electrode was extracted. Significant differences were confirmed by the Kruskal–Wallis test (P=0.0001). Pairwise comparisons within groups by Dunn׳s test indicated that the dynamics of the inter-spike segment was different from the dynamics of both the noise collected before introducing the electrode into the cell (control) and the noise collected after extracting the electrode, but no differences were indicated between these last settings (Fig. 2, right).

The median α results obtained with DFA for the voltage fluctuations of the inter-spike segments were 0.971 ([0.963, 0.995] lower and upper quartiles), 0.526 ([0.521, 0.529]) for the random permutations of the inter-spike segment and 0.978 ([0.969, 0.990]) for the synthetic fractal-like data. Significant differences were confirmed by the Kruskal–Wallis test (P=0.0001). Pairwise comparisons within groups by Dunn׳s test indicated that the dynamics of the random permutations were different from both the inter-spike segment data and the synthetic data. Accordingly, the voltage fluctuations of the inter-spike segment present long-term correlations. Notwithstanding that the analyzed inter-spike segments included 340±10 samples; such correlations were possible to be identified as it becomes endorsed by the distributions and statistical results for permutated and synthetic data (Fig. 3).

The use of the Langevin equation, adapted for ionic channels rather than synaptic inputs [54–56], and the generation of complexity cascades [57], by means of an ever increasing probability of cascade process, were selected for modeling and generating synthetic inter-spike voltage fluctuations data.

Two synthetic series with long-term correlations, as confirmed by their DFA scaling exponents (1.067±0.03 and 0.982±0.04, respectively) are shown in 
                        Fig. 4. These series were obtained by either tuning the standard deviation of the Langevin equation stochastic term or by considering grow rates that exponentially increase the connection among members that can propagate a cascade. Whereas for the use of the Langevin equation we found that it was possible to involve up to 105 coupled inputs (connectivity as 1), and for the complexity cascade the same number of system members was also feasible; see Appendix A for more details.

The scaling exponent α of a typical sequence of inter-spike time intervals (ISI) that occurred during 26min recording of a F1 neuron was 1.09±0.03, also indicating long-term correlations (
                        Fig. 5).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Our main finding is the existence of fractal-like or long-term correlations (1/f) as indicated by the scaling analysis of voltage fluctuations of the inter-spike membrane potential, suggesting the interaction of multiple levels of organization acting on different time scales [42,43]. Back et al. showed numerically that the ubiquitous 1/f noise emerges in interactive dissipative dynamical systems with many spatial degrees of freedom, evolving into self-organized critical structures of states that show a power–law scaling distribution [49]. Interestingly, this lack of characteristic scales is known to generate fluctuations spanning across time scales. Our results may then appear in accordance with other studies that provide evidence of critical-like phenomena occurring at the single-neuron level [50]. In fact, Gollo et al. have recently shown that criticality at the dendritic arbor optimizes the process for the incoming stimuli [51].

Furthermore, among different approaches for modeling a fractal long-term process (1/f) can also be modeled by the superposition of random first-order autoregressive series with different time constants [38,39]. Thus, the main mechanisms that may be involved in the modulation of membrane potential of voltage fluctuations through different time constants are the complex behavior in the spontaneous synaptic release of neurotransmitter molecules [20], the presence of long-term memory in conformational changes of different populations of ionic channels [15–18], and the modulation of cytoplasmic free calcium concentration

                     . In particular, this last mechanism is reported as a signaling system involved in the regulation of numerous processes that affects membrane potential including synaptic transmission, membrane trafficking, modulation of ionic channels such as calcium-dependent potassium channels (BK, SK), and voltage-gated calcium of L-type channels [19,29,31,40,41,58].

The scaling analysis applied here may thus offer information about the dynamics of the mechanisms generating voltage fluctuations of the inter-spike membrane potential during spontaneous electrical activity, showing long-term correlations along different time scales. In conjunction with other dynamics, these voltage fluctuations could then be modulated by different populations of ionic channels embedded in the cell membrane; for instance, by the SK channels as well as HCN4 channels, well-known mediators of the frequency of depolarization [30,44]. In fact, the use of the Langevin equation [54–56] and the generation of complexity cascades [57] were suitable for modeling and generating synthetic inter-spike voltage fluctuations data with long-term correlations as a result of either involving up to 105 coupled inputs or the same number of system members, respectively (Fig. 4). This number seems consistent with previous findings for the largest neurons of H. aspersa such as the F1, having a typical 200μm in diameter [59,22]. This would imply a density of 1channel/μm2. The

                      channels density of chromaffin or H. aspersa neurons, for instance, have been reported in 5–15channels/μm2 
                     [60].

The results of this research should complement the studies of the neural inter-spike time intervals (ISI) fluctuations, which are also know to show long-term correlations that could be linked to the dynamic frequency of neural depolarization and information encoding [1–4,7,50,52,53]. As Fig. 5 illustrates, the H. aspersa F1 neuron, in addition to showing long-term correlations for the voltage fluctuations of the inter-spike segment, also seems to manifest ISI long-term correlations. It would then appear that the temporal correlations of the inter-spike time intervals are related to the long-term dynamics of the inter-spike voltage fluctuations.

Our study may be limited by the selected sampling frequency, yet similar results were obtained from one F1 neuron using a frequency of 4kHz, though a lower dispersion of the scaling exponent (α) was obtained. Despite this limitation, we consider that it was possible, nonetheless, to incorporate the dynamic effects of different time constants of the mechanisms involved in the modulation of inter-spike segment, such as the time latency for the HCN4 channels׳ opening showing either duration or amplitude that increase in relation to the hyperpolarization [45], and the latency of the SK channels that presents a range of activation from 0.5 to 20ms depending on the intracellular calcium concentration [46–48].

Finally, one would consider the voltage fluctuations of neural electrophysiological recordings as error measurements or as a trace of residual background noise. Thus, often these voltage fluctuations have been excluded before performing analysis, by deleting or filtering them, to focus on the mean values that are considered as the best descriptors of the system. Given the identification of fractal-like correlations, the present approach provides evidence to regard such voltage fluctuations as a useful expression of the intrinsic dynamics of the system providing information about its organization and its state [42,43], thereby endorsing the occurrence of critical-like phenomena at single-neuron level [51].

                     , which all modulate the frequency of occurrence of action potentials. Thus, we hypothesized that the intracellular voltage fluctuations of the inter-spike segment present non-random dynamics. Accordingly, in this research we analyzed the intracellular voltage fluctuations of the membrane potential manifested along the inter-spike segment of the H. aspersa F1 pacemaker neuron, which is involved in the innervation of sensory organs like the osfradio. To assess their dynamic or stochastic nature, such voltage fluctuations were analyzed by Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), providing the scaling exponent α. Our results indicate a critical-like dynamic behavior at a single-neuron level that, far from being random, shows long-term correlations leading to regard such voltage fluctuations as a useful expression of the intrinsic dynamics of the mechanisms involved in regulating the membrane potential. In consequence, the results of this research should complement the studies of the temporal fluctuations for the occurrence of action potentials, which are also know to show a long-term correlated behavior that could be linked to the dynamic frequency of neural depolarization and encoding.
