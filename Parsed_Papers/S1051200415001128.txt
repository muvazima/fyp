                  In this paper, the noise enhanced system performance in a binary hypothesis testing problem is investigated when the additive noise is a convex combination of the optimal noise probability density functions (PDFs) obtained in two limit cases, which are the minimization of false-alarm probability (

Existing algorithms do not fully consider the relationship between the two limit cases and the optimal noise is often deduced according to only one limit case or Bayes criterion. We propose a new optimal noise framework which utilizes the two limit cases and deduce the PDFs of the new optimal noise. Furthermore, the sufficient conditions are derived to determine whether the performance of the detector can be improved or not via the new noise. In addition, the effects of the new noise are analyzed according to Bayes criterion. Rather than adjusting the additive noise again as shown in other algorithms, we just tune one parameter of the new optimal noise PDF to meet the different requirements under the Bayes criterion. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to study the theoretical results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

From the perspective of the classical signal processing theory, noise is generally regarded as disturbances to the system [1]. In addition, the weak signal is often submerged in unwanted noises. Therefore, making use of various methods to filter out the noise is an efficient measure to enhance information transmission and improve system detection performance.

Nevertheless, noise does not always play a negative role for all signals and systems. On the contrary, the positive effect of noise has been paid widespread concern by researchers since Benzi first proposed the concept of stochastic resonance (SR) [2–9]. Some of the more representative studies of SR in signal and information processing are shown as below: a nonlinear bistable autoregressive model applied in signal detection by S. Zozor [4,5], the noise enhanced detection performance under the Neyman–Pearson criterion analyzed by H. Chen [7,8], etc.

Naturally, the phenomenon of noise enhanced system performance, i.e. SR, can also be found in signal detection. Researches in recent years indicate that the improvement of some nonlinear systems can be obtained by increasing the background noise level or injecting additive noise to their input [9–18]. The metric of improvements can be measured by the increase of output signal-to-noise (SNR) [9] or mutual information [10], or the decrease in the average error rate [11], etc.

In the hypothesis testing problem, the research on how to improve the performance of a suboptimal detector via adding an independent additive noise to their observations is usually based on Neyman–Pearson [9,12], Bayes [13,14] and Minimax criteria [15]. In fact, the noise enhancements can also be obtained for an optimal detector in some cases, as investigated in [5,12,16]. Such as, the noise enhanced performance of optimal Neyman–Pearson, Bayes and Minimax detectors are studied in [16], which proves that the performance of optimal detectors can be improved by increasing noise level of system under certain conditions.

According to Neyman–Pearson criterion, the purpose is to increase the detection probability under the constraint on false-alarm probability [7,8,12]. In [7], a mathematical framework to analyze the noise enhanced effect in binary hypothesis testing problems is developed based on Neyman–Pearson criterion. The corresponding mechanism for noise enhanced signal detection is explored. Sufficient conditions for improvability or non-improvability and the form of the optimal noise PDF as a randomization of at most two discrete vector are determined at the same time. At the end of that paper, an illustrative example is presented to compare the noise enhanced performance between different detectors where the optimal stochastic resonance noise, as well as Gaussian, uniform, and optimal symmetric noises are applied. The study in [7] is extended to restricted Neyman–Pearson framework in [17] and [18], where the constraints become more strictly. The aim in [18] is to maximize the average detection probability under the constraint on false-alarm and worst-case detection probabilities.

In the Bayes framework, the prior information is known, while it is unknown in the Minimax framework, the purpose of them is to minimize the Bayes risk. Besides, the restricted Bayes criterion is well suited in the case of prior information with some uncertainty which is most common in practical life. In [13], the effects of additive independent noise on the performance of some suboptimal detectors are investigated according to restricted Bayes criterion. In other words, the aim is to find the optimal noise which can minimize the Bayes risk under certain constraints on the conditional risk. Based on a generic M-ary composite hypothesis-testing formulation, the optimal probability distribution of additive noise and the sufficient conditions which the performance of a detector can or cannot be improved via additive noise are derived. Besides, it studies the simple hypothesis-testing problems in more detail, such as the solution of the optimization problem of additive noise for binary case. It is obvious that the noise enhanced problem in Bayes framework and Minimax framework [15] can be viewed as special cases in restricted Bayes framework.

Based on the analysis of articles related to Bayes, we have noticed an interesting phenomenon that people always regard the Bayes risk as a whole in binary hypothesis testing problems and ignore it can be expanded as a sum of a constant and a linear combination of detection and false-alarm probabilities. These methods can reduce the Bayes risk, but may not guarantee false alarm and detection performance of detector improved at the same time. If the optimal solution of Bayes risk is deduced by the optimization of detection and false-alarm probabilities directly, the problem can be solved more easily in some cases. Based on this conception, the minimization of Bayes risk is equivalent to the decrease of false alarm probability and the increase of detection probability simultaneously.

However, it is hard to find the optimal additive noise directly to satisfy the conditions that false alarm probability reduced and detection probability increased after adding the additive noise. Hence, we first find the optimal noises minimize false alarm probability without decreasing detection probability and maximize detection probability without increasing false alarm probability, respectively, then deduce the optimal noise for the minimum Bayes risk through the linear weighted combination of the two optimal noises.

Most researchers have focused mainly on improving the detection probability. For example, the case of maximizing detection probability without increasing false alarm probability is researched in [7,8]. But so far, no study has involved in minimizing the false alarm probability without decreasing the detection probability, which is also very important in binary hypothesis testing problems. Therefore, the aim of this paper includes how to minimize the false alarm probability without decreasing the detection probability via independent additive noise, obtain the corresponding optimal noise and derive the sufficient conditions. Furthermore, we find the optimal noise which can decrease false alarm probability and increase detection probability simultaneously, derive the corresponding sufficient conditions. More importantly, the minimization of Bayes risk can be achieved according to the analysis of false-alarm and detection probabilities above. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

The corresponding optimal additive noise and sufficient conditions for different cases are derived in Section 3. Then, the minimization of Bayes risk according to the Bayes and Minimax criteria under certain conditions is researched in Section 4. Finally, a detection example and the experiment results are presented in Section 5 and conclusions are made in Section 6.

                        . Therefore, the probabilities of false alarm and detection can be adjusted by adding noise. The additive noise modified detector is shown as Fig. 1
                        .

According to the problem formulation described above, a noise enhanced model which can increase the detection probability and decrease the false-alarm probability simultaneously is proposed in this paper, which is at the core of our discussion.

                         corresponds to case (i) and

                        . As a result, we can choose a suitable η to meet different requirements. Once the value of η is determined, the corresponding additive noise for case (iii) as shown in (31) can be also determined. We can see that the suitable noise in case (iii) is adaptive to different requirements of detection performance by adjusting the value of η.

Under the two constraint conditions of the detector is fixed and the additive noise is i.i.d.,

                      are the same for every detector. So the detector is equivalent to a fusion of K individual detectors when

                        >

                      and the detection performance is monotonically increasing with K. Therefore, for the case of 
                        K
                        >
                        1
                      the optimal additive noise is the same as the one in case

Therefore, in the noise enhanced model expressed as case (iii) in this paper, we can not only increase the detection probability but also decrease the false-alarm probability.

                        . With the increase of σ, the detection probability of the original detector first maintains 0.5, then it gradually decreases after reaching the maximum 0.5807. When σ is close to 0, as shown in Fig. 4(a), the false-alarm probability acquired in case (iii) is improved 0.25 than limit case (ii) and the original detector,

                         is approximately equal to 0.75 in case (iii) as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). With the increase of σ, the false-alarm probabilities in limit case (i) and case (iii) increase gradually from Fig. 4(a), while the detection probabilities in limit case (ii) and case (iii) decrease gradually from Fig. 4(b). Namely, the performance of detector after adding noise to observation is decreased with the increase of σ. When

                           ≥

                         becomes a unimodal noise and ϕ is fixed, the detector performance cannot be improved by adding any noise.

                        , with the increase of μ, ζ and λ are close to be 0.6915 and 0.3085, respectively. In case (iii),

                         gradually decreases to 0.4043 from Fig. 5(a), while

                         decreases from 0.8143 to 0.5957 as shown in Fig. 5(b). Comparing the improvement of detection probability obtained in case (iii) with that in limit case (ii), we know that the difference between them is the same as the false-alarm difference between case (iii) and the original detector. As a consequence, we can exploit the method of case (iii) to achieve the goal of increasing the detection probability and decreasing the false-alarm probability simultaneously.

Finally, Fig. 6
                         illustrates the curves for different η when 
                           K
                           =
                           30
                        . If 
                           η
                           =
                           1
                        , it represents limit case (i). If 
                           η
                           =
                           0
                        , it denotes limit case (ii). The blue dots represent the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the original detector without adding noise. As shown in Fig. 6, no matter what η is, the ROC of case (iii) is better than the original detector. Furthermore, if 
                           
                              
                                 z

                           >
                           
                              
                                 z
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                              
                                 o
                              
                           
                        , taking an appropriate value of η can make the ROC of case (iii) better than limit case (ii).


                        Figs. 7, 8 and 9
                        
                        
                         illustrate the Bayes risks of noise enhanced detector and the original detector for different values of A, σ, and μ when 
                           p
                           (
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                           )
                           =
                           0.4
                        . From (35), the improvement of Bayes risk is equivalent to the improvement of false-alarm and detection probabilities. It is observed in Fig. 7 that as A increases, the improvement of Bayes risk obtained via additive noise increases at first and then decreases, the maximum is achieved when 
                           A
                           =
                           2
                         and gradually reduces to 0 when 
                           A
                           ≥
                           5
                        . As shown in Fig. 8, with the increase of σ, the improvement obtained via additive noise decreases, the optimal additive noise is zero when 
                           σ
                           ≥
                           
                              
                                 σ
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        . In Fig. 9, the improvement obtained via additive noise increases to a constant as μ increases. It is clearly to see that the change trend of the Bayes risks in Figs. 7, 8 and 9 are similar to the trend of false-alarm and detection probabilities in Figs. 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Therefore, Figs. 3–9 imply that, the improvement of Bayes risk obtained via additive noise is actually determined by the improvement of

                                 D
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 P

                         obtained via additive noise in case (iii) with the suitable value of η as deduced above, which is expected due to the same reasons argued in Section 3.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The existed algorithms only consider how to improve the detection probability, but have limited ability to decrease the false-alarm probability which is also very important in practice. Therefore, we have proposed a noise enhanced model in the binary hypothesis testing scenarios in this paper, where the optimal additive noise is added to increase the detection probability and decrease the false-alarm probability simultaneously. To give the exact form of the corresponding optimal additional noise for the noise enhanced model, we have established a convex combination of the two optimal noise PDFs from two limit cases, which are the minimization of

                      has been given. Then the optimal additive noise for the minimization of Bayes risk according to Bayes and Minimax criteria has been deduced by applying the expression we have developed in case (iii), and it could be obtained only by recalculating a parameter with the change of prior information. Finally, a detection example and experiment results have been given to illustrate our algorithm have superior performance in some cases and can be applied in many practical applications.
