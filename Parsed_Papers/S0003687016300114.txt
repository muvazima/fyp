                  The aim of study is to suggest a job rotation schedule by developing a mathematical model in order to reduce cumulative workload from the successive use of the same body region. Workload assessment using rapid entire body assessment (REBA) was performed for the model in three automotive assembly lines of chassis, trim, and finishing to identify which body part exposed to relatively high workloads at workstations. The workloads were incorporated to the model to develop a job rotation schedule. The proposed schedules prevent the exposure to high workloads successively on the same body region and minimized between-worker variance in cumulative daily workload. Whereas some of workers were successively assigned to high workload workstation under no job rotation and serial job rotation. This model would help to reduce the potential for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) without additional cost for engineering work, although it may need more computational time and relative complex job rotation sequences.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) create significant financial costs for medical treatment and lead to losses in productivity and higher workforce turnover (Goggins et al., 2008; Leigh, 2011). WMSDs have many causes, including severe force, non-neutral posture, repetition, and vibration. Thus, ergonomics researchers and practitioners have focused on identifying a variety of preventive intervention measures for WMSDs (Karwowski and Marras, 2003). NIOSH (1997) recommended an ergonomics program to identify and prevent WMSDs in the workplace. This ergonomics program included looking for signs of WMSD problems, developing personal equipment and engineering and administrative controls, and health care management.

Job rotation is an administrative control for preventing WMSDs and has many positive effects in the workplace, including training opportunities for a multi-skilled labor force and eliminating the boredom and monotony of simple repetitive tasks. To maximize job rotation efficiency, a proper scheme should be developed based on the workload levels and characteristics of each task. To assess the workload level, Jonsson (1988) measured workers' physical workload using electromyography to establish a job rotation scheme and evaluated the effect of job rotation. Triggs and King (2000) recommended the use of quantitative techniques to develop a job rotation schedule, such as the NIOSH lifting equation (NLE), job strain index (JSI), and rapid upper limb assessment (RULA). Horton et al. (2012) investigated the effects of task rotation, rotation frequency and order, and gender and showed that muscle fatigue was reduced when rotation between tasks involving different levels of exertion. Schneider et al. (2005) recommended that the same body region should not be used after job rotation so that workers could perform a reasonable workload by rotating through low- and high-demand jobs. Leider et al. (2014) systematically investigated previous studies and suggested that task characteristics and involved body parts were should be considered in order to reduce the physical workload and musculoskeletal complaints during job rotation.

Studies on job rotation could be divided into field studies and line-balancing studies. Field studies focused on the effectiveness of job rotation as an intervention strategy for WMSDs in various workplaces. Jorgensen et al. (2005) performed a survey on the prevalence of job rotation in the Midwestern United States and found that 42.7% of companies utilized job rotation to reduce the incidence/cost of work-related injuries and risk exposure. Aptel et al. (2008) found that the job rotation system had positive effects on reducing task monotony but did not eliminate complaints of WMSDs. The workers considered the handling tasks as a higher risk factor for WMSDs, though within the safe limits recommended in the ergonomics literature, while ergonomic experts consider extreme or awkward posture as a higher risk factor. In addition, the worker's rating of perceived exertion could discriminate between workload levels after switching tasks during job rotation (Sato and Coury, 2009).

Many studies suggested the job rotation schemes on automotive assembly lines that were generally composed of conveyor production system. Freiboth et al. (1997) found that job rotation improved workers' process knowledge, enabling a continuous improvement process. They recommended that the number of jobs and the cycle time should be determined by the task characteristics and that the jobs in the rotation should have similar work content. Frazer et al. (2003) developed a job rotation scheme to reduce high peak force based on the biomechanical model described in Norman et al. (1998), and suggested that the cumulative force from repetition or prolonged low-force work should be considered together to effectively reduce risk factors. Möller et al. (2004) quantified the exposure similarity of risk factors within and between individuals performing electronics assembly work and noted that the different exposure profile could provide a positive effect on decreasing the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. Weichel et al. (2010) applied job rotation to a sample workgroup for two months and found that the workers rotated between fewer workstations than scheduled because they preferred certain workstations and lacked understanding of job rotation. Rodrigo and Okimorto (2012) calculated workers' fatigue by measuring lactic acid levels, and suggested a job rotation scheme with 1 and 2 h intervals to prevent muscle fatigue.

The application cases of job rotation scheme could be found in various industrial areas as well as automotive industry. Job rotation for refuse collectors led to different postures and activities, reducing recovery time. However, job rotation could not decrease the physical workload level and had no effect on the peak mechanical load (Kuijer et al., 1999, 2005). Job rotation for female cashiers positively affected muscle activity in the neck and shoulders, but psychophysiological measures and pain were only partly affected (Rissén et al., 2002). Gallis (2006) recommended job rotation for forest workers in order to reduce the strain on muscular load because different muscle groups would be employed in different tasks.

On line-balancing problems, Carnahan et al. (2001) incorporated the physical demand into the assembly line-balancing problem (ALBP) with integer programming and a genetic algorithm, and showed the potential to design assembly lines that incorporated both production concerns and ergonomic criteria. Lodree et al. (2009) established a scheduling framework that considered human characteristics, and identified human behavioral characteristics that were not discussed in the traditional scheduling models. Moreover, it would be useful to integrate various human criteria into traditional line-balancing problems and scheduling models, such as human errors, cumulative workload, and resting time among others.

Optimization techniques in the operations research area were employed to develop job rotation schemes considering human criteria. Assembly line design using the mixed integer programming (MIP) model considering productivity and upper extremity workload could effectively reduce the ergonomic hazard exposure while maintaining line efficiency (Xu et al., 2012). Several studies used subjective assessments of workload to incorporate human criteria into the conventional ALBP (Chang and Chen, 2006; Choi, 2009; Mutlu and Özgörmüs, 2012).

Heuristic approaches were employed in order to design the job rotation scheme because the total number of potential job rotation schemes was large, and all possible solutions were hard to evaluate for long computation times. To reduce the computation times and to consider human criteria concurrently, various heuristic approaches were employed such as simulated annealing algorithm (SA), ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA), and fuzzy algorithm. Seçkiner and Kurt (2007, 2008) used SA and ACO to minimize each worker's workload and the workload deviation between workers. Diego-Mas et al. (2009) used GA in generating job rotation schedules while maintaining the maximum job diversification during the rotation. Asensio-Cuesta et al. (2012) used GA for job rotation schedules using the occupational repetitive action tool (OCRA) to expose workers to an acceptable level of risk. Otto and Scholl (2011) measured the workload with the NLE, OCRA, JSI, and European assembly worksheet (EAWS) and developed a line-balancing model with ergonomic criteria using SA. A model with ergonomic criteria could be a solution for leveling workload among workstations without additional financial and engineering costs. Cheshmehgaz et al. (2012) used the Ovako working posture analysis system (OWAS) to measure workload to develop a job rotation scheme using a fuzzy-genetic algorithm to minimize the maximum cumulative risk.

Attempts to minimize the risk of WMSDs could be found in both areas of ergonomics and operation research, but the approach methods of each area were different. Ergonomists showed many epidemiological cases and applications of job rotation in various industries (Freiboth et al., 1997, Frazer et al., 2003; Gallis, 2006; Aptel et al., 2008; Jorgensen et al., 2005; Rodrigo and Okimorto, 2012). Operations research studies developed job rotation models using subjective methods or observational tools for workload assessment (Asensio-Cuesta et al., 2012; Diego-Mas et al., 2009; Otto and Scholl, 2011). Previous studies demonstrated job rotation's positive effects on WMSD risk prevention (Jonsson, 1988; Carnahan et al., 2001; Kuijer et al., 2005; Michalos et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2012). However, the cumulative workload from successive use of the same body region in the job rotation was not considered and repetitive movements over prolonged work periods could be a critical risk factor for WMSDs.

Many observational techniques were developed to measure the physical workload under various workplace conditions. OWAS was developed based on ratings of working postures taken in several divisions of one steel factory (Karhu et al., 1977). RULA was proposed to investigate the workplaces where work-related upper-limb disorders were reported (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993). Rapid entire body assessment (REBA) was developed to be sensitive to the type of unpredictable working postures found in health care and other service industries (Hignett and McAtamney, 2000). The REBA is similar to RULA, but is the REBA classified the leg posture more detail than RULA. Therefore, REBA can be used effectively in many industrial sectors with various working posture such as engine oil company workers (Motamedzade et al., 2011), forging industry workers (Singh et al., 2013), and order fulfillment packer (Lasota, 2014).

The aim of this study is to develop a job rotation model considering the physical workload resulting from whole body posture. The REBA is used to measure the workload of each workstation at automotive assembly lines. REBA is an observational tool for assessing the entire body in a variety of tasks, and provides scores for each body segment including force, coupling, and activity for worker. The job rotation model aims to reduce the cumulative workload on the same body region and to minimize the daily workload variation among workers.

@&#METHODS@&#

The aim of the job rotation model in this study is to minimize the between-worker variance in cumulative, whole-body, daily workload and to eliminate the sequential high loading during the job rotation. The most important objective of job rotation is to decrease the exposure time to risk factors, though it may not eliminate it. However, if the job rotation schedule was not designed to account for the characteristics of the previous workstation, this positive effect of job rotation could be missing. For example, a worker at a workstation with lumbar flexed posture could be assigned to a workstation with the same posture after the job rotation. The worker was exposed to the same risk factor though the workstation changed. A cumulative workload could be placed upon the worker though the workload level of each workstation was safe considering WMSDs. The proposed job rotation model defines the workstation exceeding the median workload on each assembly line as the high workload and prevents sequential high loading of the same body region on job rotation.

The assumptions of the assembly line in this study are as follows.
                              
                                 (1)
                                 Workers can conduct all workstation tasks and have the same skill level.

One worker conducts the tasks of only one workstation on each rotation period.

Only one worker is assigned to the workstation on each rotation period.

Workers should not be assigned more than once to the same workstation in a single day.

Workers should not work consecutively at workstations with a relatively high workload on same body region.

Cumulative workload does not carry over to the next working day. Therefore, any workstation could be assigned to the worker in the first work period in a day.

When the job rotation schedule is established, workers will assigned to next workstation for following working day start. In other words, worker who is assigned to workstation 1 for period 1 on the first working day will be assigned to workstation 2 at following day beginning.

A worker's workload was assessed with the REBA postural analysis tool (Hignett and McAtamney, 2000) because various working posture were observed at automotive assembly lines such as standing, stooping, and squatting. The REBA assessment is composed of ratings for each body segment and ratings for force, coupling, and activity. Each body segment has its own risk levels to assess. “Posture score A” is composed of the ratings for the neck, the lower back, the legs (Table A score), and the load/force. “Posture score B” consists of ratings for the upper arm, the lower arm, the wrist (Table B score), and the coupling. The REBA score can be computed from the activity score and the compounded score of Posture scores A and B.

Xi,p,s is a binary decision variable using 0 and 1, and means that worker i is assigned to workstation s in rotation period p. REBAs represents the workload of workstation s and the sum of REBAs for worker i during a day is expressed as WLi. Posture scores were divided into two groups, high or low workstation workload, based on the median value of each Posture score. A workstation exceeding the median value of Posture score A exposes workers to a relatively high workload on the neck, the lower back and the legs while working at that workstation. Indexes, parameters, and decision variables used in this study are as follows.

The objective function, Eq. (1), minimizes between-worker variance in the cumulative daily workload, derived from the traditional equation of variance.

The constraints, Eqs. (2)–(4), represent the conventional job rotation constraints. Eq. (2) indicates that a worker should be assigned to only one workstation on each rotation period. Eq. (3) indicates that only one worker should be assigned to each workstation on each rotation period. Eq. (4) indicates that workers should not be assigned more than once to the same workstation in a single day. Eqs. (5) and (6) prevents workers from being assigned to consecutive workstations that impose a high workload on the same body region.

This mathematical model for job rotation was computed with IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio 12.2.

A workload assessment with REBA was performed in an automotive assembly line to apply to the job rotation model and 28 workers voluntarily participated in the workload assessment. The assembly line had a 60-s cycle time and had break times every 2 h. Two video camcorders were used to record the working posture at opposite sides of the worker during three cycle times. Workers were instructed to work at the regular speed and according to the standard working method. Work sampling was then carried out in order to capture the postures in various tasks of the workstation. The number of sampled observation was calculated with the Eq. (7). The preliminary study showed the work activity was 84.7%, so that the sample observations were carried fifty observations under a confidence level of 95% with a 5% of error. Each observation was assessed with REBA, and the average REBA scores for 50 observations were used for the overall workload of the workstation.

Three different assembly lines were selected for various tasks in an automotive assembly line – the chassis line, trim line, and finishing line. Tables 1 and 2
                        
                         show the characteristics and the workload scores for each assembly line. The median value of Posture score A and Posture score B were used as the classification standard for the workstation's work intensity. In the chassis line, the workers usually worked under the vehicle body frame and one workgroup was in charge of 7 workstations. The workers were usually exposed to a high workload level on the upper extremities, resulting in a higher Posture score B than Posture score A, except for workstation 7. The workers in the trim line handled electric wiring, inner/outer fabrics, and trims, with a lumbar flexion or a squatted posture. Thus, a higher workload on the lower back and legs was observed, so that Posture score A was higher than Posture score B. The finishing line's workers finished tasks for variety of automotive parts, in which the workers conducted the tasks with various postures, exposing all body segments to a similar workload level. Workgroups in the trim line and the finishing line were in charge of 8 workstations. Three assembly lines were well administrated to prevent the WMSDs so that no additional activity score occurred and load/force score occurred on the one workstation only.

The stations in the three assembly lines were classified into two groups, high workload workstations, and low workload workstations (Table 3
                     ). The high workload workstations represent stations with a mean Posture score exceeding the median value for that part of the body. Workstation 6 in the chassis line, workstation 7 in the trim line, and workstation 5 in the finishing line had a high workload on the entire body.

To verify that the proposed job rotation model which named job rotation reducing cumulative workload (CWJR) could reduce the cumulative workload, two conditions of job rotation were compared – no job rotation (NJR) and serial job rotation (SJR). Under NJR, a worker works at a station for a day without job rotation. Under SJR, a worker shifts to the previous or the next workstation sequentially at break time.

The job rotation schedules for each assembly line were solved for each condition and were verified as to how many successive high workload assignments occurred. NJR and SJR job rotation schedules were not presented because of the simple assignment. Fig. 1
                      displays the optimized job rotation using the proposed model.


                     Table 4
                      displayed the number of successive high workload assignments and the daily cumulative workload. The workers on NJR and SJR schedules suffered successive high workloads on one or both parts of the body, while there was no successive high workload under the CWJR schedule (Table 4). For example, worker 1 in the chassis line would work at station 6, which had a high workload on both parts of the body. Therefore, the stations preceding and following workstation 6 should have a low workload on both parts of the body to prevent successive high workload assignments.

The standard deviation of the cumulative workload was largest when the job rotation did not occur at any assembly line. The standard deviation of cumulative workload in the CWJR schedule is smallest in the chassis and finishing lines, though the smallest in the trim line was in the SJR schedule.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This study presented a job rotation model that could prevent WMSDs resulting from cumulative workload. The model was applied to an automotive assembly line so that workers did not conduct a task with a high workload on the same body region successively. One aim of job rotation is not to eliminate the risk factors but to reduce the exposure time to risk factors. Therefore, a job rotation schedule to prevent WMSDs effectively should consider the characteristics of task so that workers are not assigned to consecutive tasks with the same risk factor.

REBA could assess the entire body's posture and workload, and was applied to build the proposed job rotation schedule in this study. REBA divides the body into six segments so that each segment can be assessed individually including force, coupling, and activity. However the job rotation model in this study used Posture score A (neck, lower back, and legs), and Posture score B (upper arm, lower arm and wrist). Though Posture scores were not developed for independent usage, REBA could divide the workload on the upper limb from whole body workload.

REBA scores, including posture scores, were used to measure the workload of workers on automotive assembly lines. One assembly workgroup had various work postures, but two workgroups had asymmetric use of parts of the body. The job rotation model presented in this study could build a rotation schedule preventing sequential assignment to workstations with relatively high workloads. For workgroups whose tasks had similar work postures, the job rotation model could distribute the exposure time between the workers. At the same time, the variation of workload between workers was minimized, except for the workers in the trim line. The standard deviation of cumulative workload on the chassis and finishing lines were diminished by 43.5% and 35.9%, respectively, when compared with SJR scheme. However, compared with the SJR schedule, the standard deviation of cumulative workload on the trim line increased to 1.02 from 0.42.

Compared with conventional assembly line balancing, some previous studies identified the negative effects of considering human criteria. The models considering human workload required additional manufacturing resources, such as cycle time, workstations, or workers. Otherwise, the models could impose a risky workload on workers without the additional manufacturing resources (Carnahan et al., 2001; Mutlu and Özgörmüs, 2012). The trim line's job rotation schedule in this study showed similar results. Workloads on each workstation in trim line were well balanced, so that daily cumulative REBA score variations between workers was small under the SJR schedule. However some workers suffered successive high workload on same body region under SJR schedule. To eliminate the successive high workload on same body region, the workload variation between workers could be compelled to increase when the human workload was considered, though the model aimed to minimize the variation between workers in the model.

Conventional ALBPs used workload to prevent WMSDs. However, most studies regard workload as an additional constraint on workstations, but could not prevent cumulative workload carried over from the preceding workstation in which the same body region was used. Therefore, workload was dealt with as the limit to safe workload levels (Seçkiner and Kurt, 2007; Mutlu and Özgörmüs, 2012; Cheshmehgaz et al., 2012), or as a leveling-off of the workload (Choi, 2009; Seçkiner and Kurt, 2008; Michalos et al., 2010). Moreover, if workstation sequence was a critical constraint, a job rotation schedule considering the preceding workstation would be the only solution to reduce cumulative workload. The proposed job rotation model could expose workers to various working postures or to balance the exposure time to risk factors, as well as relieve the monotony or boredom from performing similar tasks.

This study used the median score to define “high” and “low” workload on each workstation. Some workstations would have no practical differences though they were categorized into different workload. Small workload gap between workstations could be summed up in two causes. First, target workstations had been balanced with work intensity across the workstations. Second, average REBA score could smooth the differences though workstation had high risk posture. Therefore an ordinal measure was needed to define the level of workload though the workloads had no practical significance.

The proposed job rotation model had some limitations. First, more administrative work was required to develop and operate the job rotation schedule than for SJR because it requires measurement of risk factors, application to a mathematical model, and a complex rotation sequence. Second, the proposed model unintentionally distributed the same workstations to two workers, although the sequence differed. Some workers could be assigned to the same workstations on following day because it assumed that workload did not carry to the next day. Therefore, the model can be more useful if the constraint of limiting assignments on assembly lines with high workloads could carry forward to the next day is added. Third, a follow-up study on the assembly line was not completed, so WMSD prevention effects could not be identified. Evaluation on job rotation is difficult because of long-term observation after implemented. But much changes occurred on workplace would cause difficulties to identify the effect of job rotation. Therefore previous studies on job rotation showed inconsistent evidence for recommending job rotation (Leider et al., 2014). Forth, the evaluation of the proposed model was compared with NJR and SJR conditions. The constraints of the proposed model prohibited the assignment on sequential high workload workstation. However, sequential high workload condition could occur under NJR and SJR so that the comparison could not have much meaning. If the comparison with random job rotation sequences is performed, the evaluation of proposed model would be more convincing analysis. Lastly, the non-linearity of the objective function created long computation times for the job rotation solution. The proposed model's objective function contained a quadratic function, though the constraints were linear. A heuristic computation procedure, such as GA, SA, or fuzzy algorithm could reduce the computation time.

Furthermore, additional workload assessment tools would enable a more precise evaluation of workload in the job rotation model. Working postures observed in this study showed various postures such as standing, stooping, squatting, so that REBA was used to assess the workload. REBA could offer a highly general posture analysis, but REBA could not discriminate precisely the small movement of each body part or repetitive use of body part. Therefore detailed workload information could be obtained if more specific assessment tools, such as the NLE, JSI, and OCRA, were included in the job rotation model.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This study presented a job rotation scheduling process that could reduce cumulative workloads from the successive use of the same body region. First, the mathematical model was developed to compute the optimal job rotation schedule. Second, the workloads of automotive assembly lines were assessed with REBA, and the impact of each workstation on parts of the body were classified into high and low workload groups. Finally, the assembly line workloads were incorporated to the job rotation model to prevent WMSDs. A job rotation schedule was successfully designed to prevent workers from working at high workload stations sequentially, without additional costs for engineering work.

The proposed job rotation model can be applied to job rotation scheduling in various industrial sectors. It will be especially useful for practitioners with job rotation scheduling challenges from assembly lines with similar tasks. Moreover, a well-designed job rotation schedule may help to improve the effectiveness of administrative controls in the ergonomics program.
