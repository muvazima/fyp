                  To determine initial velocities of enzyme catalyzed reactions without theoretical errors it is necessary to consider the use of the integrated Michaelis–Menten equation. When the reaction product is an inhibitor, this approach is particularly important. Nevertheless, kinetic studies usually involved the evaluation of other inhibitors beyond the reaction product. The occurrence of these situations emphasizes the importance of extending the integrated Michaelis–Menten equation, assuming the simultaneous presence of more than one inhibitor because reaction product is always present. This methodology is illustrated with the reaction catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase inhibited by phosphate (reaction product, inhibitor 1) and urea (inhibitor 2). The approach is explained in a step by step manner using an Excel spreadsheet (available as a template in Appendix). Curve fitting by nonlinear regression was performed with the Solver add-in (Microsoft Office Excel). Discrimination of the kinetic models was carried out based on Akaike information criterion. This work presents a methodology that can be used to develop an automated process, to discriminate in real time the inhibition type and kinetic constants as data (product vs. time) are achieved by the spectrophotometer.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The usual determination of initial velocities by drawing a tangent line to the reaction curve is theoretically incorrect since the substrate decrease and potential inhibitory reaction products accumulate. As previously explained there is an incompatibility between the kinetic data and the underlying model [1]. To avoid this incompatibility the model must be integrated to give a description of the reaction progress. Another possibility is to differentiate the data (determining rates) nevertheless if an appropriated kinetic model for a given enzyme reaction is not known, determination of initial velocities is not theoretically accurate. Thus the kinetic studies must evolve by the use of the integrated Michaelis–Menten equations even if only for determination of initial velocities [2,3].

The integrated Michaelis–Menten equation in its classical implicit form [4,5] or in its explicit form [6] have other advantages: (i) the initial addition of a product inhibitor can be eliminated and K
                     
                        i
                      evaluated [7–10] allowing for example to determine inhibition constants, of a particular reaction product isomer, more accurately since they are based on correct stereochemistry and complete purity [11]; (ii) the possibility to determine the inhibition constants without knowledge of true substrate concentration [9,12,13]. This is of special mention in heterogeneous reactions where the substrate is insoluble.

One of the main caveats regarding the use of integrated Michaelis–Menten equation to entire progress curve analysis is the possibility of gradual enzyme activity loss under the assay conditions. However, nothing prevents its use with much lower percent substrate depletion [2,5,10]. Thus, in this work integrated equations will be applied only to data points usually utilized to determine initial velocities (up to 10% substrate depletion).

The integrated Michaelis–Menten equations have not been usually applied in the presence of two inhibitors in the reaction medium. Nevertheless, integrated equations find special interest in studies with two different inhibitors since product inhibition is often found as a common regulating enzyme mechanism [4,9,14–17]. Thus, to study the inhibition kinetics of this kind of enzymes it is necessary to consider the simultaneous presence of two inhibitors because one of them is a reaction product (it is always present). The main objective of this work is to develop and apply integrated equations to the kinetic analysis of reactions carried out in the presence of two inhibitors when one of them is a reaction product whether or not mutually exclusive.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

Alkaline phosphatase (E.C. 3.1.3.1.) was obtained from BDH. All the other reagents used are readily available from major suppliers such as Merck. Stock solutions of 4-nitrophenylphosphate disodium salt and 4-nitrophenol were prepared at concentrations of 20mM. Reactions were carried out at 37°C containing 9.5μg enzyme in 2.75ml reaction volume and different amounts of 4-nitrophenylphosphate (between 18.4 and 1500.0μМ) in 0.1M Tris/HCl buffer, pH 9.0. The amount of product (4-nitrophenol) formed at several time intervals (10–60s) was determined by absorbance at 405nm, using a spectrophotometer (path length, 1cm) in conditions that never surpass 10% of substrate depletion. Another set of similar reaction experiments was also performed but in the presence of 1.25M urea (inhibitor).

Data processing and analysis was carried out by integrated Michaelis–Menten equations according to [5] but taking into account the simultaneous presence of two inhibitors being one of them a reaction product (Supplement 1 and 2). Diagnosis of enzyme inhibition and kinetic constants were estimated by non-linear regression with Solver (Solver is an add-in program included in the Excel software that is only necessary to be activated to use them [5]) and discrimination between different models was performed by Akaike information criterion (AIC) as previously explained [5,18]. Kinetic constants were also estimated by initial velocities [19]. Both kinetic methodologies used the same experimental data points. Kinetic parameter uncertainties were determined by an Excel template [22] and also by the software SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences).

Kinetic analysis with the integrated Michaelis–Menten equations permits the determination of inhibition constants (K
                     
                        i
                     ) when more than one reaction product inhibits the enzyme [9,14,16]. In this situation:

                     where K
                     
                        ij
                      is the inhibition constant for one single product and K
                     
                        i
                      is the global inhibition constant taking into account all products. In enzyme reactions characterized by the presence of two different product inhibitors, Hsu and Tsao [20] showed that if there is no addition of an initial inhibitor (at time zero) the two constants, K
                     
                        ij1 and K
                     
                        ij2 cannot be individually determined because they are in a lumped form. Nevertheless in the present study a different condition occurs since urea is not a reaction product which means that inhibition constants for urea and phosphate are not lumped [17]. Furthermore, Orsi and Tipton [4] advocated that when two inhibitors exhibit different inhibition types, linearization of integrated equations (e.g. [14]) is not appropriate because different kinetic effect of inhibitors is indistinctive. The use of non-linear regression is a simple way to overcome linearization weakness [9].

All common types of linear inhibitions are included in linear mixed inhibition model (MI) since some inhibition constants can tend to infinity, meaning that they are irrelevant giving rise to other linear models (see Supplement 1) [5,10]. Assuming the mixed linear inhibition (MI) the following Michaelis–Menten rate equation is obtained:

The Eq. (6) can be simplified, giving rise to simplified nested models (Supplement 2) with fewer number of parameters such as the uncompetitive inhibition (UC), noncompetitive inhibition (NCI), competitive inhibition (CI) or without inhibition (WI) [5,10]. These models are simplifications of model MI, assuming that different constants (K
                     
                        iu1, K
                     
                        ic1, K
                     
                        iu2, K
                     
                        ic2) tend to infinity. In Supplement 1 the equations are also rewritten in order to be used in Excel software accommodating one or two inhibitors or even no inhibitor. These equations have a wider range of applicability than those used before [5] and should be preferred.

These equations are always equations for predicting the reaction time it takes to obtain a certain amount of product. The explicit form (expressed in terms of the W-Lambert function) has the advantage to preserve statistical rigor since substrate concentration is a function of time [6]. Due to fitting difficulties of the intrinsic W-Lambert function a new method (logistic enzyme kinetics) was developed [23]. Nevertheless the implicit form continues to be used and the methodology presented in this paper can be adapted to accommodate an explicit form.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The utilization of Microsoft Office Excel software and the Solver add-in to determine kinetic parameters of the Michaelis–Menten equation has been previously explained [5,19]. The only difference is that the equations are more complex and there are two different concentrations of inhibitors. To facilitate the insertion of equations in the appropriate Excel cell, they were partitioned into α, β and γ components as explained in Supplement 1 and 2. Briefly, it is necessary to fill a blank worksheet with data points similarly to Excel spreadsheet (Supplement 2) and to calculate the time necessary to obtain the product P (calculated time).

This kinetic investigation consisted of two parts: discrimination between available models (Tables 1 and 2
                     
                     ) and parameter estimation (Table 3
                     ). According to Table 1, models CI, NCI and UCI have the same number of parameters and so it is enough to compare the SSE value for discrimination. The comparison reveals that NCI is better than any other model since the SSE value is lower. However, the lowest SSE value was obtained with the MI model, but the increase in parameter numbers rise the incertitude about the best model. Thus, statistical discrimination is necessary to compare NCI with MI models. There are several methods to compare and discriminate models such as extra sum-of-square F test, as Mannervik [24] or Akaike information criterion (AIC) [25]. The AIC methodology (Table 2) was chosen because it has the advantage that kinetic models can be nested or non-nested and the results give a continuous scale for model plausibility as previously discussed [5,18]. The results show that the better model is the MI model with a probability near 100% and should be preferred. For the same reason it is also necessary to compare the WI with MI (Table 2) in order to rule out that model WI is not appropriated. Experimental data points and simulation lines using model MI with Solver optimized parameters (Table 3) are shown in Fig. 1
                     A. To compare using initial velocities methodology [19] the values are presented in Fig. 1B and Table 3. V
                     max (μmolmin−1
                     mg−1) can be obtained from k
                     
                        v
                      (μMs−1 (μg/2.75ml)−1) [5]. The residual plots (Fig. 2
                     ) obtained from data in Fig. 1 show the absence of systematic errors once the residuals are scattered above and below of predicted curve.

By the analysis of Table 3 it is evident than K
                     
                        iu1 (uncompetitive inhibition constant of phosphate) tend to infinity (is too large compared to K
                     
                        ic1) and therefore phosphate (inhibitor 1) is predominately a competitive inhibitor. Urea (inhibitor 2) presents similar values for K
                     
                        iu2 and K
                     
                        ic2, showing the predominance of non-competitive inhibition. If both inhibitors are of the same type, for example competitive, it will be expected that the best model is the competitive type. In this case the discrimination of kinetic models was finished and the parameters can be obtained from the best model discriminated. The results of Table 3 do not fit in this situation because phosphate has a predominantly competitive inhibitor behavior and urea has a predominantly noncompetitive inhibitor behavior (or eventually mixed).

Supplement 3 contains a summary of hypothetical kinetic inhibition combinations obtained from possible results of the best model discriminated. In the presence of different types of inhibition (as in this study), it is necessary to confirm inhibition patterns of phosphate and urea individually.

In this case to say categorically that the phosphate is a competitive inhibitor it is necessary to analyze the results considering only assays with phosphate (initially present or not) as explained previously [10]. In this study there is not phosphate initially present but only generated as a reaction product that increases with time. To do this is necessary to analyze the experimental points obtained without the presence of urea (in Excel template are only considered the values listed until the line 72) although used equations are the same. In this situation when nonlinear regression is performed, the quotients G10/$B$3 and G10/$B$6 have no influence on the equation because cell G10 is always zero (cells $B$3 (K
                     
                        ic2) and $B$6 (K
                     
                        iu2), do not change because they do not interfere in the equation). The results obtained in this situation are showed in Tables 4 and 5
                     
                      and it is possible to conclude that CI is better than MI with a probability of 77%, and also better than WI with a probability of 100%. The inhibition constant obtained was K
                     
                        ic1
                     =10.7μM.

In order to evaluate the inhibition pattern of urea, only a modified MI equation is used. As phosphate is a reaction product it is not possible to study the inhibition of urea without the presence of phosphate. Thus, it is necessary to copy MI equation model (Supplement 1) to five spreadsheets and to give e.g. the following names to the five spreadsheets (WIm, CIm, NCIm, UCIm and MIm; when “m” means modified). Modifications of MI model are necessary because phosphate inhibition constants (K
                     
                        ic1 and K
                     
                        iu1) are now fixed values and it is not possible to do that with the equations of Supplement 1. Thus K
                     
                        ic1 (cell B2) and K
                     
                        iu1 (cell B5) will be fixed by inserting in each spreadsheet the values obtained in previous study without the presence of urea (K
                     
                        ic1
                     =10.7μM and K
                     
                        iu1
                     =∞ (e.g. 3.3×106
                     μM obtained in Table 3), i.e. converting them in non-variable parameters). Additionally, other minor changes in each of the five spreadsheets should be performed as explained in Table 6
                     . Before carried out nonlinear regression, do not forget to remove in the option “by change the cell” (Solver dialog box) the cells $B$2 (K
                     
                        ic1) and $B$5 (K
                     
                        iu1). The discrimination result in Tables 7 and 8
                     
                      show that urea is a mixed inhibitor with a probability of 57%. The constants obtained were K
                     
                        ic2
                     =2.6M and K
                     
                        iu2
                     =3.3M.

Data points and model MI simulation with solver optimized constants (Table 3, integrated equation) are presented in Fig. 1A. The constants obtained with the integrated Michaelis–Menten equation and by traditional methods (initial velocities) are compared in Table 3. It should be pointed out that determination of inhibition constants, K
                     
                        ic1 and K
                     
                        iu1, by the Michaelis–Menten equation (initial velocities) requires the initial addition of phosphate in another set of assays without urea. As above explained, the study of urea inhibition alone by initial velocities is not theoretically possible because phosphate is a reaction product. Several authors concluded that urea is a noncompetitive inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase [26,27]. Nevertheless, in this work, the probability of alkaline phosphatase inhibition by urea to be of the noncompetitive type is not fully supported because slightly different inhibition constants (K
                     
                        ic2 and K
                     
                        iu2) were obtained in the MI model discriminated (Table 8) by Akaike information criterion. This difference could be due to the fact that effect of phosphate inhibition was not considered in traditional methods by initial velocities. Now it is possible to state that phosphate is a competitive inhibitor and urea is a mixed inhibitor with the inhibition constants presented in Table 3.

It is important to point out that some alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes present a reversible inhibition by urea (up to 2M) and others are more sensitive and present an irreversible inhibition by denaturation [26,28], a phenomenon not observed in this study. The use of the integrated Michaelis–Menten equation to the entire progress curve is known for long time. The option to use only initial data range was chosen in order to theoretically eliminate possible interferences such as, enzyme denaturation or change of initial conditions (pH, temperature, etc.).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This work put in evidence that integrated Michaelis–Menten equation is a powerful methodology for the analysis of enzyme reactions even in the presence of two inhibitors being one of them a reaction product. The methodology can be used with only limited data points usually utilized to determine initial velocities. The possibility of utilizing this methodology to determine kinetic constants in general kinetic studies and the possibility of developing spectrophotometer software to indicate “on line” and in real time the type of inhibition and kinetic constants is important to point out.
