                  The consistency check within each pairwise comparison matrix is an important step in an Analytic Network Process (ANP) decision. In an ANP network there is both the ability and the need to test for additional levels of consistency or coherency among the priority vectors. Examples are used to highlight cases where a Supermatrix with priority vectors that were obtained from either perfect or nearly perfect consistent pairwise comparison matrices generates suboptimal decisions. Simulations are used to further demonstrate the frequency of these occurrences in general ANP networks. A form of cross validation within the Supermatrix called linking validation is developed and demonstrated. The linking validation method allows decision makers to use the priority vectors within the Supermatrix to validate other priority vectors within the Supermatrix. The linking validation method involves generating linking estimates. The linking estimates are compared against each other to identify the most incoherent priority vector by calculating the Linking Coherency Index (LCI) scores. The decision maker can then update the specified priority vector and repeat this process until the LCI-score for every linking estimate is below the given threshold. The use of linking validation to test for coherency further improves the validity of ANP models.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is an amazing decision making method that takes advantage of our natural ability to make relative comparisons. The influential criteria in a decision can be organized into clusters within a network and through the aggregation of the relative comparisons the overall relative influence of the alternatives can be calculated. The ANP and a specific subset of ANP problems referred to as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be considered a disruptive technology; and since its initial debut it has been applied in many areas (Saaty & Ozdemir, 2008). As with any great tool or method the results are only as good as the user input; and hence the common phrase, “garbage in, garbage out,” can be used to emphasize the need for unbiased, reliable, and valid data under any method or approach including the ANP. One way to test and control for the quality of the inputs in an ANP model is the consistency index (Saaty, 1977) for the pairwise comparison matrix (PCM). Many variations of this method that focus on the PCM have been proposed (Ergu, Kou, Peng, & Shi, 2011).

Human decision makers are subject to all sorts of biases (Kahneman, 2011). While there is no reason to suspect the ANP exacerbates any of these biases, it would not be safe to assume the method serves as a total immunization from them. With the original consistency index, when one was not ordinally consistent and said that a > b, and b > c, but then said c > a or if the intensity of the measured relationships was not consistent enough, it would not be advisable to proceed because of data quality issues within the PCM. More about the consistency index in a PCM is discussed in greater detail in the literature review; but what about consistency beyond the PCM?

As we think of realms of influence in an ANP network, the priority vectors obtained from the PCMs are aggregated within a much larger realm of influence within an ANP Supermatrix. As a Supermatrix is an aggregate of multiple measurements across many scales, it is difficult to see how one could check for a greater level of consistency beyond the PCM. But what if one could? What if there was a way to cross validate the overall Supermatrix for a level of consistency or coherency that would serve as a data quality check for the priority vectors within the Supermatrix? One might also wonder why such a test would be needed if there is a high level of, or even perfect, consistency within the PCMs. After reviewing the relevant literature, Section 3 motivates the need for such a test with examples to highlight realistic scenarios where a problematic Supermatrix can arise and would otherwise currently go undetected. While this new safeguard could be termed a Supermatrix consistency check, it is simply referred to herein as linking validation and coherency testing. Next, in Section 4, simulated decisions further demonstrate in general that performing coherency testing within a Supermatrix is crucial in order to obtain meaningful results with the ANP. In Section 5, a Linking Coherency Index (LCI) is proposed to provide another level of checks and safeguards to improve the reliability of ANP decision models. Section 6 contains a sample decision Supermatrix that is derived from the examples in Section 3 where the LCI is demonstrated to identify the problematic priority vectors. Finally, in Section 7, concluding remarks and suggestions for future research are discussed.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

First, the relevant literature regarding methods to check for consistency within a PCM is highlighted. Other reviews provide detailed critiques of the pros and cons of the different methods; and because this new approach is not at the level of the PCM such a critique is tangential and will not be addressed herein. Next, to understand the solution provided in Section 5 it is worthwhile to review some additional findings regarding linking pins and the units of measurement in priority vectors. These concepts will now be addressed in greater detail beginning with the check for consistency.

The consistency issue within a PCM has been categorized into the following three categories (1) cardinal inconsistency, (2) ordinal inconsistency and (3) both (Kou, Ergu, & Shang, 2014). The first calculations of consistency within an AHP PCM were proposed by Saaty (Saaty, 1980; Vargas, 1982). The value of improving consistency within a PCM has been demonstrated through simulations (Herman & Koczkodaj, 1996; Siraj, Mikhailov, & Keane, 2012) and other examples from the literature that have proposed new approaches. Ozdemir (2005) calls for more redundancy in comparisons and shows how inconsistency measurements can be generalized to a collection of clusters. Multiple methods have been developed to address and reduce cardinal inconsistency within a PCM (Cao, Leung, & Law, 2008; Harker, 1987; Saaty, 1980; Zeshui & Cuiping, 1999). Similarly many algorithms have been developed to study and improve the ordinal consistency (Ali, Cook, & Kress, 1986; Gass, 1998; Kwiesielewicz & Van Uden, 2004; Mikhailov & Knowles, 2010; Pahikkala, Waegeman, Tsivtsivadze, Salakoski, & De Baets, 2010). There has also been research to address and resolve both forms of inconsistency within a PCM (Genest & Zhang, 1996; González-Pachón & Romero, 2004; Kou et al., 2014; Li & Ma, 2008). Each of these methods focuses on consistency at the level of the PCM and can be employed to improve consistency at that level. Additionally, some methods have been proposed specifically for applications within the ANP (Ergu et al., 2011; Leung, Hui, & Zheng, 2003). All of these methods are useful; and consistency at the PCM level must be addressed in order to develop meaningful decision models. There are also some additional relationships and links among the priority vectors within a Supermatrix that should be discussed because of the important role they will play in the ability to validate the priority vectors within a Supermatrix.


                        Saaty (2005) suggests using a form of linking or “pivot” comparisons among non-homogeneous items where the relationships between the object’s sizes exceed the use of the 1–9 scale. This example was extended by Saaty and Shang (2011) to demonstrate how acts of kindness or service, termed “intangible contributions to society” can be measured and compared by using pivot comparisons. Schoner, Wedley, and Choo (1993) propose a linking pin approach in an effort to address and unify approaches to the AHP. The linking pin approach is a normalization process that can be used in both a hierarchy and a network. They show linking can be done because the criteria and alternatives are structurally dependent on one another. From this dependency it can be seen that everything in the Supermatrix is related. The importance of this dependence and the ability to link will be highlighted again and demonstrated in Section 5.

The concept of structural dependence is easy to see within a given criterion cluster. One issue that may arise when combining separate criteria clusters or networks is the question about what then is the unit of measurement in the overall network? Criteria weights in general are misunderstood and misused (Choo, Schoner, & Wedley, 1999). Choo et al. (1999) demonstrate that there is no consensus on the meaning or manner of deriving criteria weights. Furthermore, the criteria weights should not be calculated in a way that is independent of how they are used in decision model. While criteria weights can be used for the column normalization process, normalization in and of itself does not remove the units from the criteria being considered. Wedley and Choo (2001), explain that ratio scales in the ANP have a unit of measure and the unit of measure is important and useful. The unit of measurement is derived from the topmost node. The scale that one can obtain from such a unit is transient depending on the alternatives being considered but so is the ratio scale itself. Focusing on the ratios rather than the rank will improve the efficacy of the ANP. Wedley and Choo (2011) conclude “Therein lie both the advantage and dilemma of AHP. We do not need explicit knowledge of the underlying unit of measure to derive a ratio scale, yet the derived scale has a unit.” This understanding that the unit of measurement is derived from the topmost node provides a unit to use as the basis for comparing criteria across clusters. A novel application of linking pin comparisons and understanding the units of measurement will allow the creation of additional estimates to cross validate the data in the Supermatrix.

We begin with a hypothetical scenario to conceptually motivate the need for a coherency test to check for this higher level of consistency. The term coherency is borrowed from Bayesian analysis (Hastings & Gross, 2012) and metrology (VIM, 2004). Coherent data can be defined as self-consistent and non-contradictory with respect to a particular system. The coherency test is fully developed after the frequency of this issue occurring in general ANP models is shown in three examples within this section and then generalized in the simulations conducted in Section 4.

Assume a decision maker is trying to choose between which of two individuals to ask on a date; and decides to evaluate them based on the following two intangible criteria: intelligence and attractiveness. Furthermore, assume the eligible individuals are both equally attractive and equally intelligent; and also that both criteria equally contribute to each of the persons’ overall value. In other words, the priority vector for Person 1 and Person 2 would be (.5, .5). While in practice this model with two equally preferred alternatives wouldn’t be very a useful model it will highlight the limitations of only checking for consistency within the PCM. As the decision maker makes the pairwise comparisons they will all be perfectly consistent because each PCM only has two elements. Sample priority vectors are provided below where we also assume that when comparing the two individuals against each other with respect to intelligence an incorrect yet perfectly consistent comparison was made.


                     
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  

In general there is nothing inherently wrong with the intelligence rating provided above; but in the context of this specific model used to rate these specific individuals the (.4, .6) priority vector doesn’t make sense. Step back and assume one didn’t know that all the alternatives were equal in all aspects. This is where the value of testing for coherency adds to the current literature; the remaining information in the weighted Supermatrix can still be used in a cross validation test to check if all the entries are coherent i.e. non contradictory with respect to a particular system.

Even though every priority vector was perfectly consistent, at the higher level of the Supermatrix the (.4, .6) priority vector contradicts the information the other priority vectors are indirectly providing about intelligence. In this simple example, one can logically reason that if intelligence and attractiveness are equal among each person and both individuals are equal in terms of attractiveness then it follows that each person must also both be equal in terms of intelligence to be coherent at the level of the Supermatrix much like in a PCM if a > b and b > c then a > c in terms of ordinal consistency. Hence the (.4, .6) vector is contradictory to the other priority vectors provided.

Testing for coherency could be said to check for the consistency or non-contradiction across priority vectors in the whole system. By testing for coherency this decision maker would be advised that the intelligence priority vector should be revised until it no longer contradicts the other priority vectors in the network. Before the mathematics of the LCI are developed, three less obvious and more realistic examples demonstrating the need for coherency within a Supermatrix will now be shown.

For the next three examples a network that consists of three alternatives (A
                     1, A
                     2, A
                     3) and six criteria which were further organized into two criteria clusters 
                        
                           (
                           
                              C
                              
                                 1.1
                              
                           
                           ,
                           
                              C
                              
                                 1.2
                              
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              C
                              
                                 2.3
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      was used. The network can be seen in Fig. 1
                     . The ANP structure used in the subsequent examples and proof was chosen because it is a common structure with multiple criteria clusters. Examples of similar models and networks can be found in Saaty and Vargas (2013) and Saaty and Ozdemir (2008). Multiple criteria clusters are used here and in the proof to emphasize that this approach is not limited only to simple ANP networks where all of the criteria have the same unit but can be used in general ANP networks. The properties that make this generalization possible are demonstrated in Eqs. (14) and (15) and the citations and discussion surrounding those equations.

The examples begin with a true weighted Supermatrix which was provided by a decision maker with perfect knowledge of her priorities who evaluated three alternatives (A
                     1, A
                     2, A
                     3) with respect to the six criteria broken out into 2 criteria clusters of different units 
                        
                           (
                           
                              C
                              
                                 1.1
                              
                           
                           ,
                           
                              C
                              
                                 1.2
                              
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              C
                              
                                 2.3
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     . In other words, the comparisons used to generate the true weighted Supermatrix were both perfectly consistent and accurately reflected her priorities. In addition, to make the comparative examples more meaningful, the limiting priorities of the alternatives were required to differ from one another by a relative priority of at least 0.02. Meeting this requirement ensures that the following examples represent a problem worth analyzing with the ANP and the limiting priorities are different enough to highlight the need for testing for coherency in ANP decisions.

We begin with the weighted Supermatrix to focus the discussion on the need for coherency and not on the decision maker’s judgments. The true weighted Supermatrix represents what the decision maker would have done provided she could observe and perfectly measure her priorities with respect to each criterion and alternative. Said another way, it serves as a base case and then in each of the three subsequent examples we assume different types of errors that current methods would not identify. The errors demonstrated in these examples are then adapted and used in Section 6 where the new cross validation method is demonstrated. By beginning with the weighted Supermatrix we are focused on the principle and the method and not on the specific weightings of a specific decision. By using this more general framework and following up the examples with the simulations we show this is a general problem that should be addressed in every ANP model.

The true weighted Supermatrix S is given in (1). Its accompanying limiting priorities and the rank of the alternatives, will provide us with the parameters, given in Table 1
                     , that the subsequent three examples will be compared against.

                        
                           (1)
                           
                        
                     
                  

The limiting priority vector in Table 1 is obtained by calculating the limit matrix Slimit
                      by raising the weighted Supermatrix to powers according to the following equation (Saaty, 2005):

                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                    
                                       l
                                       i
                                       m
                                       i
                                       t
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 
                                    lim
                                    
                                       n
                                       →
                                       ∞
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    S
                                    n
                                 
                                 .
                              
                           
                        
                     For the decision represented by the true weighted Supermatrix in (1), the limiting Supermatrix is:

                        
                           (2)
                           
                        
                     
                  

The limiting priority vector is obtained from any column from the bottom left hand side of the limit matrix in (2). In the subsequent examples we will omit the limit matrix and simply provide the weighted Supermatrix and final priorities.

These parameters show that A
                     3 is the preferred alternative followed by A
                     1 and then A
                     2. When comparing the limiting priorities from the subsequent examples, the approach suggested by Wedley and Choo (2011) to focus on ratios and not rank will be employed with the extension that the ratios from the examples will change to such an extent that rank also changes. In other words, because the ANP deals with intangibles, one can assume that minor differences in final rank can and will occur; however, the ratios here change to such an extent that the models provide conflicting results that would lead the decision maker to very different courses of action. The next three examples each demonstrate a different reason that testing a Supermatrix for Coherency is an effort worth pursuing. After presenting the method, the concepts from these three issues will be aggregated together in a new Supermatrix where linking validation is used to identify and remedy these problems.

This first example, found in (3), is intended to represent a genuine attempt to estimate the true Supermatrix by an expert decision maker who is very knowledgeable about the subject matter. To capture this scenario the entries in the first estimated Supermatrix are reasonably precise while still introducing some imprecision. The pairwise comparisons in each PCM were generated by using the data from true preference intensities which were then perturbed by a randomly generated amount when the pairwise comparisons were made. Every individual priority vector had a maximum inconsistency ratio limit of 0.03 according to Saaty’s consistency ratio (Saaty, 2005).

                           
                              (3)
                              
                           
                        
                     

With such a restrictive limit and every other step of the ANP followed correctly one would assume that A
                        3 would again be the preferred alternative. Because measurements are imprecise and will differ from one estimation to the next, in making the comparisons against the true model one should naturally expect the individual priorities of each alternative to differ between the true model and the estimated model. However, in this example the concern is that the limiting priorities differ to such an extent that the wrong alternative is ranked as the preferred alternative as can be seen in Table 2
                        .

In this first example, a well-intended decision maker had done everything necessary to obtain the correct answer when in fact the best alternative that was identified in the true Supermatrix is the worst alternative in this model. This first example motivates the need for additional checks and tests for coherency within the Supermatrix to increase the likelihood that an ANP model and its derived priorities can be interpreted with confidence. The first example attempts to portray a realistic scenario of a wise and responsible expert attempting to analyze a complex decision with intangible criteria. The comparisons are very good but still imprecise which in and of itself is not a problem. However, in practice without any additional tools or methods, or in particular the true Supermatrix to check against, this problem would currently have gone undetected. In response, one may simply require that a higher level of consistency be imposed. However, as will be demonstrated in the next example, similar undesired results can occur in a Supermatrix with priority vectors from perfectly consistent PCMs.

The second example will be used to highlight a case where every PCM was 100 percent consistent and yet the limiting priorities still changed to such an extent that the final rank again changes for each alternative. Once again the results mislead the decision maker by showing that A
                        3, the most preferred alternative, is the worst alternative. This example serves to show that requiring lower and lower levels of inconsistency on its own cannot remedy the need to test for coherency in a Supermatrix because consistency at the level of the PCM is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. As can be seen in (4), every column of the estimated Supermatrix is identical to the true Supermatrix with the exception of the C
                        1.3 column. The entries in the C
                        1.3 column have been reordered to represent three potential scenarios. Before explaining these scenarios it is important to emphasize that the PCM used to obtain this reordered vector is still perfectly consistent. The first reason such a vector could be obtained is a simple comparison error by a knowledgeable decision maker. This could occur because of fatigue or simply user error when entering the data; and if this error is repeated a consistent PCM can be obtained. The second reason this could occur is under specific cases when the vector should be inverted to be meaningful when aggregated with other vectors in the Supermatrix (Barzilai, Cook, & Golany, 1987; Fichtner, 1986). For example, bigger is not always better; when comparing cars with respect to their mileage one may need to invert the comparison to show that lower mileage is better in that particular decision. The third scenario could occur when the decision maker may think he understands C
                        1.3 well enough to make the comparisons when he does not, but he still achieves perfect consistency, or nearly perfect consistency in a more general case, in his comparisons.

                           
                              (4)
                              
                           
                        
                     

The reordered entries for the C
                        1.3 column in (4) follow the second possibility explained above. This priority vector while from a perfectly consistent PCM lead to the limiting priorities changing to such an extent that the rank of every alternative changes even though every other PCM was both accurate and perfectly consistent. The estimated priorities and ranks can be seen in Table 3
                        . This particular vector for C
                        1.3 will be included in the weighted Supermatrix in Section 6 of this paper where the solution is demonstrated. Before the solution is proposed a final example shows that not even an entire priority vector need be wrong but even only a few comparisons within a single PCM can lead to undesired results.

The prior examples went from an entire Supermatrix filled with priority vectors from near consistent PCMs to a Supermatrix with priority vectors from perfectly consistent PCMs wherein a mistake was made in calculating the priorities within a single PCM which translated to a single column in the Supermatrix. In the final example, the issue will occur with respect to a single element within one PCM. Table 4
                         compares elements within the PCM for C
                        1.1 with the correct data and an attempt where the decision maker had some challenges measuring A
                        3. First when compared to A
                        1 there is some minor error involved by undervaluing A
                        3 as 2.03 vs. 2.16 times greater than A
                        1. The second error could either be user error or switching which is greater along with a minor error to change the comparison from 1.51 to 1.48. These small amounts of inconsistency are entered to reflect as Herman and Koczkodaj (1996) explain that when measuring intangibles is involved it will lead to “not only imprecise or inexact knowledge but also inconsistency in their own judgments”.

The eigenvector from the estimated PCM in Table 4 is used to replace the true Supermatrix C
                        1.1 priority vector to obtain the estimated Supermatrix in (5). This Supermatrix is raised to powers and the limiting priorities in Table 5 show that the first and second alternatives have changed rank and this model would therefore lead the decision maker to not choose the most preferred alternative. The eigenvector for C
                        1.1 in this example will be used in the example that will be shown in Section 6.

                           
                              (5)
                              
                           
                        
                     

The prior examples demonstrate specific cases of undesired outcomes each for different reasons. It would be useful to know at what frequency these unintended rankings could occur in practice. In order to estimate the frequency of the unintended outcomes Monte Carlo simulations were performed. The model begins by defining a given number of alternatives to be evaluated with respect to a given number of criteria within each cluster. The value that each criterion element provides for each alternative is then randomly generated from a Uniform(1, 9) distribution to ensure the comparisons remain within the 1–9 scale. A simulated decision maker creates the network and performs the pairwise comparisons. Then the priorities are entered into the Supermatrix, the limit matrix is calculated, and the results are compared to the true values.

Two sets of simulations were performed. In the first set of simulations, 100,000 decision models were simulated as decisions with four alternatives evaluated with respect to twelve criteria. The twelve criteria were organized into three clusters with four criteria each. Additional combinations of varying amounts of alternatives and criteria were evaluated in the second set of simulations. Table 6
                     
                      contains the results from the first set of simulations.

Two different variables were used to impose different upper limits on the random perturbation of the pairwise comparisons in every PCM: a perturbation index and the consistency ratio (CR) limit. Each set of comparisons were drawn independently to capture how as humans it is difficult to create the value, or a value function, for a single element in exactly the same way every time an element is compared to another element. The first variable is the perturbation index which is an upper limit on how much the value or each element could be perturbed in each comparison. The simulations are run under four scenarios where the perturbations were randomly generated from Uniform distributions with parameters (0, 0.2), (0, 0.3), (0, 0.4) and (0, 0.5). Note that with a 0.3 perturbation index the pairwise comparisons will on average be off by 0.75 units and at most 2.7 units using a continuous distribution on the standard 1–9 scale. The direction of the perturbation was also randomly decided with equal probability given to the positive and negative direction. The simulation did not restrict the comparisons to integer results as imposing this assumption significantly increases the error rate. The different perturbation indices were then simulated under different CR limits. In each simulation the average inconsistency index of every PCM in each scenario was calculated; and if needed the pairwise comparisons would be repeated until the PCM was sufficiently consistent. The average number of attempts metric reflects the average attempts required to obtain a PCM that had a consistency index below the CR limit under each perturbation index. The most important piece of data in the table is the error rate which reports the percentage of times when the ratios of the limiting priority vectors changed enough that the rank of at least two of the alternatives changed. This change in the ratios would lead the decision maker to choose a less preferred alternative as the most preferred alternative. With respect to the percent change in the final priority vectors in the limit matrix, the simulation also required that the true priorities differ by at least 0.02 to be more realistic by eliminating models with alternatives that would be problematic because the priorities were almost identical.

In Table 6 it is first worth noting the robustness of the ANP! Even with an upper limit of 0.2 for the perturbation index, only approximately 1 percent of decisions will suffer from undesired rankings. These results should motivate the readers to want to engage in linking validation knowing the ANP is an effective decision making tool. A second reason to engage in linking validation comes from the additional results in the table. Currently, a decision maker may set very low inconsistency limits and create a well-intended ANP model; however, unbeknownst to the user between 7 percent and 29 percent of the time he may obtain unintended results. As was stated earlier, at the 0.3 perturbation index, on average the comparisons would be off by less than 1 unit on the 1–9 scale. Larger values of the perturbation index resulted in even higher percentages of models with incorrect rankings. However, they were not included in the table because while the PCMs were consistent enough, the amount of deviation begins to reflect an unknowledgeable agent making the decision. In addition, it is worth noting that there is no positive association between the consistency limit of a PCM and the accuracy of the rankings from the model. On the contrary, in these results they appear to have a negative association at least on the surface. This can be explained by the fact that as lower levels of inconsistency are required it is more likely to have PCMs with error like the one demonstrated in Section 3.3 which meets the tolerance requirements for consistency but does not reflect the actual priorities of the elements being compared. One additional finding from these simulations regarding the use of only the integers on the 1–9 scale is addressed in the conclusion.


                     Table 7
                      presents additional combinations of different numbers of alternatives with respect to various combinations of criteria within different cluster combinations. Each of these simulations was performed with a maximum perturbation index of 0.4, with a CR limit of 0.05, and also with the requirement that the true priorities from the limit matrix differ by a priority of at least 0.02. The patterns are similar to those in Table 6 and show that these undesired effects are not a direct function of the size of the network or criteria clusters. These frequencies can be greatly reduced by using the linking validation method presented in the next section.

@&#METHOD@&#

The proposed decision making process is summarized in Fig. 2
                     . The decision maker designs the initial network with the alternatives to evaluate with respect to the relevant criteria. Pairwise comparisons are performed as usual and the PCMs are evaluated for a minimum level of consistency and revised as needed. The priority vectors from the PCMs are entered into the Supermatrix. At this point before obtaining the limit matrix the Supermatrix linking validation is carried out. The step of Performing Linking Validations can be further broken down into the 5 steps given in Table 8
                     . Finally, the improved Supermatrix is raised to powers and the limiting priorities are obtained from the limit matrix. The mathematical details of the linking validation process are provided below and an application is provided in Section 6.

Assume that a network of n alternatives is to be evaluated according to m criteria. Without the loss of generality, for now let

                     . Also assume that the true priorities provided by these alternatives with respect to the criteria exist and can be evaluated by a decision maker as below.

Using these priority vectors, we can fill in the weighted Supermatrix as shown below:

                        
                           (12)
                           
                        
                     
                  

In reality, since we do not have access to the true ω s, the weighted Supermatrix is filled using the priority vectors calculated by solving Eq. (7). Let the weighted Supermatrix estimated in such a way be 
                        
                           S
                           ^
                        
                      where

                        
                           (13)
                           
                        
                     
                  

Before raising this estimated weighted Supermatrix to powers to get the limit priorities from the limit matrix, some additional validation will be done to improve the compatibility of the data in 
                        
                           S
                           ^
                        
                     . Running the traditional consistency checks as in Eq. (6) helped determine whether the priorities were consistent only at the level of the PCMs. In addition, we want to look at all the comparisons and priority vectors together to be able to test relationships within the Supermatrix. It is possible to do this type of check and as a result improve the Supermatrix before calculating the limit matrix by utilizing the dependent nature of the data in the Supermatrix explained by Schoner et al. (1993), Wedley and Choo (2011), Choo et al. (1999). By using existing priority vectors within the Supermatrix as links for other parts of the Supermatrix we calculate linking estimates. Steps 1a–c in Table 8 are explained below. First, every column of the Supermatrix is converted to a new ratio by dividing the components of each vector by any common element within the priority vectors; the first element in each priority vector will be used herein. The resulting matrix will now have the form:

                        
                           (14)
                           
                        
                     
                  

It is important to recognize that the number “1” in each vector is different from the number “1” in another vector in (14). If only one could determine the relationship between the “1”s in each column because then all the entries in each side of the Supermatrix could be converted into ratios of the same unit. Using the linking pin concept (Schoner et al., 1993), the converted ratios from one half of the Supermatrix are the linking pins for the other half of the Supermatrix. To see this, one can examine the relationships in the true Supermatrix in (12). If one performed this first transformation on (12), the relationship between the new ratios and “1”s in the columns C
                     1.1 and C
                     1.2 would be 
                        
                           
                              ω
                              
                                 1.2
                                 ,
                                 1
                              
                           
                           
                              ω
                              
                                 1.1
                                 ,
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      and that information is available from the other half of the Supermatrix, in row 2 of the A
                     1 column, hence each “1” is a ratio of the others. Recognizing this relationship is what allows one to create the linking estimates.

This process will now be demonstrated using the entries in the upper right hand side of the estimated Supermatrix as the links to convert the entries in the bottom half of the Supermatrix into quantities of a single unit. According to step 1b, the converted bottom half will have the form:

                        
                           (15)
                           
                        
                     
                  

With each entry in each column now represented in units of a particular, yet same, ratio as in (15) they can be aggregated and combined obtain a new estimate of S, according to Step 1c, which we call a linking estimate that will be used for the linking validation of the estimated Supermatrix 
                        
                           S
                           ^
                        
                      in (13). This new Supermatrix will be notated by 
                        
                           S
                           
                              C
                              
                                 1.1
                              
                           
                           L
                        
                      since the criterion C
                     1.1 was used as the link. This estimate can be obtained by performing the following calculations:

                     . It is worth noting that the columns of the linking estimate Supermatrix in Eq. (16) are of a form similar to the priority vectors in (10) and (11).

The same process can be repeated 
                        
                           n
                           +

                      times where n is the number of alternatives and m is the number of criteria; a different criterion or alternative is chosen as the link each time, resulting in 
                        
                           n
                           +

                      linking estimates. If every column vector had been measured without any error then the linking estimates we generated for linking validation would all be identical to S because of relationships in (13). In practice, however, each priority vector will have some bias and imprecision. Hence the linking estimates will not be equal to S nor 
                        
                           S
                           *
                           L
                        
                      (the other linking estimates). But when a priority vector i.e. column in 
                        
                           S
                           ^
                        
                      is used as the link to create a linking estimate the more coherent it is the more the estimate will look like S and 
                        
                           S
                           *

                           S

To check the similarity across the linking estimates we propose using the Linking Coherency Index (LCI). Coherent data can be defined as self-consistent and non-contradictory with respect to a particular system. This check for a higher level of consistency in the Supermatrix along with checking that the priority vectors are non-contradictory can significantly improve the validity of an ANP model. The idea is to compare the linking estimates to each other since we do not have access to S and determine which estimate is the most different when compared to the others. This will tell us that the column of 
                        
                           S
                           ^
                        
                      which was used as the link to get that particular linking estimate is problematic and needs to be updated. This process is carried out iteratively: dealing with the most-off column in each iteration. In respect to garbage in - garbage out, we assume that at least half of the priority vectors in 
                        
                           S
                           ^
                        
                      are reasonably valid so that when we identify a linking estimate as problematic and update the link that yielded that particular estimate, we are not by mistake changing a valid part of 
                        
                           S
                           ^

                      is obtained by comparing all the linking estimates obtained by using alternatives as links with each other as explained in Eq. (17). Similarly a new m × m LCI matrix Lcrit
                      is obtained for the linking estimates obtained by using criteria as links. For

                      with two clusters of equal size, the LCI matrices will then be in this form:


                     
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  


                     
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  

Then, in step 2b, LCI-scores for all the criteria and alternatives are calculated by averaging the LCI values in each column in both LCI matrices except the comparison of a linking estimate against itself and are notated by

                      will also improve the performance of the method significantly and based on simulated models we suggest using

                     . The linking validation method will now be demonstrated with a numerical example.

The Supermatrix in (19) represents a combination of the three examples presented earlier and will be compared against the results from the parameter case. The C
                     1.1 and C
                     1.3 columns are taken directly from Examples 2 and 3 in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 to be used in this example. While the Supermatrix that is the exact aggregation of all three examples could have been used, to be more concise, another matrix with similar yet smaller deviations than the one used in Example 1 in Section 3.1 was used to create the estimated Supermatrix 
                        
                           S
                           ^
                        
                      below:

                        
                           (19)
                           
                        
                     
                  

As the examples from Section 3 that are combined here were all based on manipulations of the true weighted Supermatrix (1), its limiting priority vector and rank is what we are trying to approximate in this example. In Table 9
                      the True priority and True rank were obtained from raising (1) to powers and originally presented in Table 1. The Limiting priority and rank were obtained by raising the Supermatrix 
                        
                           S
                           ^
                        
                      in (19) to powers. The Limiting priority changed to such an extent that the ranks also changed.

First, according to Step 1a–1c, the linking estimates are calculated according to the steps in Section 5 and are provided in Appendix A. From the linking estimates, the 
                        
                           
                              L
                              C
                              I
                           
                           ¯
                        
                      are calculated as in (18) for the criteria linking estimates and the alternative linking estimates that are calculated in Step 2 and shown in (20) and (21).

The Linking estimate with the largest 
                        
                           
                              L

                              I
                           
                           ¯
                        
                      is identified as 
                        
                           S
                           
                              C
                              
                                 1.3
                              
                           
                           L
                        
                      in Step 3. While none of the priority vectors in this initial Supermatrix were precise, C
                     1.3 generates an estimate that is the least like the others and consequently should be revised in Step 4. The decision maker would then revisit the C
                     1.3 PCM and update her comparisons within the PCM.

The PCM can be revised by eliciting new pairwise comparisons within that specific PCM, or if the decision maker is not available or cannot revise the comparisons then one of the three methods proposed in Saaty (2003) can also be used, Other methods also exist to improve consistency within a PCM such as the method proposed by Ergu et al. (2011). While these methods can help improve the consistency of a PCM as was demonstrated in the examples provided earlier, consistency is a necessary but not sufficient condition. In this example we assume the decision maker can revise the PCM and replace the current C
                     1.3 priority vector with the C
                     1.3 priority vector from the true Supermatrix to update 
                        
                           S
                           ^
                        
                     . From the updated 
                        
                           S
                           ^
                        
                      in Step 5 we return to Step 1 and the subsequent linking estimates are calculated and new 
                        
                           
                              L
                              C
                              I
                           
                           ¯
                        
                      values are obtained from Step 2 as in (22). Should the 
                        
                           
                              L
                              C
                              I
                           
                           ¯
                        
                      values become worse the decision maker will need to revisit the PCM again and revise the comparisons or address the challenge that they may not understand the criterion well enough to proceed with confidence in the overall results.

                        
                           (22)
                           
                        
                     
                  

In Step 3 the C
                     1.1 linking estimate is now the least coherent with the other estimates. The decision maker should revisit the respective PCM and revise the comparisons there to obtain a new hopefully more coherent priority vector (Step 4). Again in this example the C
                     1.1 priority vector from the true Supermatrix will serve as the updated priority vector (Step 5). The newly updated estimated Supermatrix is used to calculate a new set of linking estimates with 
                        
                           
                              L
                              C
                              I
                           
                           ¯
                        
                      values given in (23) (Steps 5 and 1).

                        
                           (23)
                           
                        
                     
                  

Every linking estimate is now more coherent with the others and falls below the cut off of 
                        
                           ϵ
                           =
                           1.1
                        
                     . The revised 
                        
                           S
                           ^
                        
                      is then raised to powers to calculate the limiting priorities. As can be seen in Table 10
                      the limiting priorities from the updated estimated Supermatrix are now not only very close to the True Supermatrix priorities but A
                     3 is also shown as the preferred alternative in both models and the decision maker can make this decision with a new level of confidence. This increased confidence comes from using the linking validation process to see that the comparisons were consistent according to a new level of coherency within the entire Supermatrix.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The value of using the priorities within an ANP Supermatrix to validate the entire set of priority vectors within said matrix has been clearly shown in the linking validation example in Section 6. The need for such a test was demonstrated by showing different cases where the current methods would not detect problematic data: overall incoherency even with highly consistent PCMs, perfect PCM consistency but still an incoherent Supermatrix, and finer levels of incoherency. While the most common event may be overall incoherency, simulations returned unintended rankings from 6–30 percent of the time when Supermatrix coherency is not addressed. In an effort to further improve the coherency of the ANP Supermatrix a general linking validation method was developed and demonstrated. By using this linking validation approach decision makers can identify and revise problematic priority vectors and therefore have more confidence in the results from their model.

The application of the linking validation method is exciting and seems crucial to improving the decision making process. It is also important to recognize that much like consistency, coherency is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an accurate model. Just as one can be totally consistent but wrong, one could also be totally coherent and wrong. However, one difference between consistency and coherency is that coherency runs across multiple scales. Which in theory it would be more difficult to be systematically wrong across multiple scales in a way that is also coherent much like having all the jurors in agreement about the wrong decision.

Future extensions will also be valuable to develop other ways to conduct and even refine the linking validation process. There are two other areas of research that are worth addressing. First, the simulations provided herein highlight the need for even more precision in the pairwise comparison process. This simulation used real numbers between 1 and 9. Limiting decision makers to integer values leads to higher levels of error in the simulations and hence were not presented here. The examples contained herein call for even more precision in the pairwise comparison process. For example, in Section 3.3 it was shown how small changes in the values from individual pairwise comparisons can lead to the undesired outcomes as it was noted that the second perturbation of a single comparison was a change in the comparison by much less than what might have happened had the comparison been forced to an integer value that wreaked havoc on the model. This level of sensitivity was observed in many of the observations from the simulations. The information gathered from further research could identify how precise the comparisons need to be in order to increase the success of the ANP.

Second, linking validations will have significant impacts on the coherency of priority vectors obtained by using fuzzy ANP methods. If one value of an element is used in one place, e.g. to compare the criterion against other criteria within an alternative, and then another value for that same element is used in another place, e.g. to compare the element with respect to the criterion’s contribution to each alternative, then the final rankings may be misleading because of issues with the coherency of the separately generated priority vectors. One possible solution is to introduce the fuzziness in (13) and then generate simulated fuzzy Supermatrices similar to the linking estimates. However additional considerations may also be necessary. Each of these lines of future research will further validate and extend the use of linking validation in the ANP.
