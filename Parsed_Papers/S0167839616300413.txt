                  Hierarchical generating systems that are derived from Zwart–Powell (ZP) elements can be used to generate quadratic splines on adaptively refined criss-cross triangulations. We propose two extensions of these hierarchical generating systems, firstly decoupling the hierarchical ZP elements, and secondly enriching the system by including auxiliary functions. These extensions allow us to generate the entire hierarchical spline space – which consists of all piecewise quadratic

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

We consider spline spaces spanned by Zwart–Powell (ZP) elements, which were originally introduced by Zwart (1973). These functions are compactly supported 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                     -smooth piecewise quadratic spline functions defined on criss-cross triangulations, which are also called four-directional grids or type-2 triangulations (Wang, 2001). ZP elements were also recognized as a special instance of box splines, see de Boor et al. (1993) and the references cited therein.

The approximation power of ZP elements has been studied thoroughly in the literature. It was shown by Lyche et al. (2008) that no local quasi-interpolant projector exists for the box spline space defined by translates of the ZP element. Quasi-interpolation operators and the approximation power of ZP elements have been studied by Dahmen and Micchelli (1984), Dagnino and Lamberti (2001) and Foucher and Sablonnière (2008).

Various applications of ZP elements and of the spline spaces generated by them have been described in the literature. These include computer tomography (Entezari et al., 2012; Richter, 1998), computation of isophotes (Aigner et al., 2009), approximation of medial surface transforms (Bastl et al., 2010), generation of offset surfaces (Bastl et al., 2008) and numerical simulation (Kang et al., 2014).

The underlying criss-cross triangulation, which is associated with the ZP elements, possesses a highly regular structure, which precludes the possibility of adaptive refinement. This is similar to the case of tensor-product splines.

Hierarchical splines are one of the main approaches – besides T-splines (Sederberg et al., 2003), PHT-splines (Deng et al., 2008) and LR splines (Dokken et al., 2013) – that were developed to overcome this limitation. Their construction was originally proposed by Forsey and Bartels (1988). About ten years later, Kraft (1997) published a selection mechanism that defines a basis for hierarchial splines and designed a quasi-interpolation operator. Yvart et al. (2005) studied hierarchical triangular splines, whereas Speleers et al. (2009) explored hierarchies of Powell–Sabin splines. Recently, Giannelli et al. (2012) proposed truncated hierarchical B-splines as a modification of Kraft's basis for hierarchical tensor-product splines to restore the partition of unity property without scaling and to improve numerical stability and sparsity properties. Quasi-interpolation operators in this framework were discussed by Speleers and Manni (2016).

The applications reported in the literature include surface fitting and reconstruction (Greiner and Hormann, 1997; Kiss et al., 2014) and isogeometric analysis (Vuong et al., 2011; Schillinger et al., 2012). The idea of truncated hierarchical B-splines has recently been generalized to spaces of functions spanned by generating systems that are possibly linearly dependent (Zore and Jüttler, 2014; Kang et al., 2014). In particular, these studies include the case of ZP elements.

In fact, Kang et al. (2014) in their paper use adaptively refined spaces spanned by hierarchical ZP elements for isogeometric analysis. Their result concerning linear independence (Lemma 4) unfortunately contradicts the related result of Zore and Jüttler (2014) and relies on local linear independence, which is not satisfied by ZP elements, not even after removing one of them to restore linear independence.

The completeness problems for spline spaces is one of the fundamental questions in spline theory. Given a partition of the domain into cells (e.g., a triangulation) and a generating system of smooth piecewise polynomial functions defined on it, does it span the entire spline space consisting of the piecewise polynomial functions with a specified order of smoothness? It is closely related to the computation of the dimension of a spline space. See the monographs of Lai and Schumaker (2007) and Wang (2001) for a detailed introduction.

Several approaches to answer the completeness question and to compute the dimension have been proposed in the literature. The very powerful approach of using techniques from homological algebra was introduced by Billera (1988) and has been further explored since, e.g., by Mourrain (2014) and Schenck and Stillman (1997). The important particular case of biquadratic splines on hierarchical T-meshes has been extensively studied using the smoothing cofactor method (e.g., Huang et al., 2006; Zeng et al., 2015), and similar results are available for higher degrees as well. Indeed, the case of tensor-product splines of general degree on hierarchical meshes has attracted particular attention due to the importance for applications.

Homological techniques for hierarchical tensor-product splines were used by Berdinsky et al. (2014, 2015). The characterization of the contact of polynomials via blossoming led to the results by Mokriš et al. (2014) and Mokriš and Jüttler (2014). These generalize the earlier results of Giannelli and Jüttler (2013) on bivariate splines to the full multivariate case.

The present paper extends the latter approach to the case of bivariate splines on adaptively refined criss-cross triangulations, which are obtained by collecting triangles from a hierarchy of nested criss-cross triangulations. The case of triangulations with only one level is studied in Section 2. Considering triangles from criss-cross triangulations of several levels simultaneously leads us to the definition of the multilevel spline space, which is formalized in Section 3.

Since ZP elements are defined on each of the criss-cross triangulations that form the hierarchy, it is natural to produce a generating system by selecting ZP elements of the different levels using a suitably modified version of Kraft's construction. In order to achieve completeness of this generating system, and to control its linear dependencies, we propose to decouple the ZP elements and to enrich the hierarchical generating system by additional functions, see Section 4. Suitably generalizing the techniques of Giannelli and Jüttler (2013) then enables us to establish the completeness property under certain technical assumptions in Section 5 and to analyze the resulting linear dependencies in Section 6.

After reviewing some well-known facts about Zwart–Powell box splines, we show that their restrictions span the entire space of

                      where each k is a connected subset of D that is not contained in any other connected subset of D.

We now classify the vertices which are contained in a multicell domain 
                        
                           
                              D
                           
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                        
                     . A regular vertex is characterized by the fact that 
                        
                           
                              D
                           
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                        
                      is a topological manifold with boundary in its sufficiently small neighborhood. Each regular vertex belongs to one of the types schematically shown in Table 1
                      (up to rotations by integer multiples of 
                        π
                        /
                        2
                      and reflections). The symbols shown below denote the number of vertices of the particular type, where e and f stands for vertices of valence 8 and 4 in the underlying grid and the lower index specifies the number of incident triangles. We omit the index ℓ to simplify the notation.

The remaining vertices will be called kissing vertices. Based on their valence with respect to the underlying grid, they will be called valence-4 kissing vertices and valence-8 kissing vertices, respectively. An example is shown in Fig. 2
                     . Note that the valence does not refer to the criss-cross triangulation of 
                        
                           
                              D
                           
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                        
                      but to the underlying grid. There is only one possible type of a valence-4 kissing vertex, while several types of valence-8 kissing vertices exist, see Fig. 2.

                        Proof
                        The proof consists of two steps: Firstly, we prove the theorem in the case of a single connected component without kissing vertices, based on the dimension result (2). Secondly, we extend it to domains with valence-8 kissing vertices and several connected components.


                           Step 1. We consider a simply connected domain without kissing vertices. According to Lemma 5 it suffices to prove that

Each non-axis-aligned (i.e., diagonal) boundary edge connects one vertex of valence 4 with one vertex of valence 8, and each boundary vertex has between zero and two incident non-axis-aligned boundary edges. Counting the contributions of the boundary vertices of the two different valencies separately gives

                           Step 2. First we extend our result to simply connected domains with valence-8 kissing vertices. Such a domain can be subdivided at the kissing vertices into several simply connected parts. (For instance, the domain in Fig. 5 (right) is subdivided into 6 connected parts without kissing vertices.) Any function in

                                    Δ
                                 
                                 
                                    ℓ

                           , which is defined on the entire domain, can be represented as a linear combination of the functions in the separated generating system on each of these parts. Clearly, each of these representations can be modified by adding a real multiple of the chessboard pattern, since the coefficients thereof correspond to the zero function.

We number the parts, starting with 1, so that each part is connected by a kissing vertex to exactly one part with a lower number, except for the first one. At each kissing vertex, exactly four functions in each of the separated generating systems on the parts joining there take non-zero values. We visit the parts according to the chosen ordering and add a scaled multiple of the chessboard pattern to make sure that one of the four associated coefficients takes the same value. Since the function is

                                    1
                                 
                              
                           -smooth at the kissing vertex, the remaining three coefficients take the same values too, as there are three equations characterizing a 
                              
                                 
                                    C
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           -joint at the kissing vertex. This completes the proof for simply connected domains with valence-8 kissing vertices.

Finally, we note that, since the support components are considered separately, the theorem extends to admissible domains with more than one connected component, as the representations on the different components are independent of each other.  □


                     Theorem 8 does not generalize to domains possessing valence-4 kissing vertices, since there are five functions in each of the separated generating systems on the parts joining there that take non-zero values. Moreover, the theorem is not valid for non-admissible domains, as demonstrated by the following example.

The dimension of the spline space defined on that domain is equal to 41 according to Lemma 2. Enforcing

                            is shown in Fig. 6 (right). The function is equal to zero everywhere except in the green region. Within that region, the function is defined as a linear combination of the six ZP elements with the coefficients specified in the picture. Due to the choice of these coefficients as a subset of a chessboard pattern, the function is

                           . However, it does not admit a representation by ZP elements of level 0.

Indeed, this function can be represented as a linear combination of 42 ZP elements on the simply connected domain obtained after removing AB, where only six coefficients (the ones shown in the figure) take non-zero values. These six coefficients correspond to the six ZP elements that are split into pairs of separated functions, and the non-zero coefficients are assigned to the separated functions that act on the right-hand side of AB. This representation on the simply connected domain is unique up to additions of multiples of the chessboard pattern. However, no addition of such a multiple gives a representation with the property that the six pairs of coefficients of the separated ZP elements possess matching values. ⋄

In the remainder of the paper we consider criss-cross triangulations of several levels and the ZP elements defined on them simultaneously. An adaptively refined spline space is defined with the help of a hierarchy of subdomains.

The next section proposes a generating system for the multilevel spline space. An affirmative answer to the completeness question will be given later in Section 5.

We introduce decoupled Zwart–Powell elements and auxiliary functions, which we will call partial chessboard functions. The enriched decoupled hierarchical generating system is then constructed using a selection procedure which is inspired by the work of Kraft (1997).

It should be noted that we use a slightly modified definition of the support in the remainder of the paper. Since the domain of all functions under consideration is the set

                      of level ℓ is a refinement of the coarser space spanned by the elements of the coarser levels. Raising the level ℓ increases the approximation power, see Foucher and Sablonnière (2008).

In Section 2, we introduced the separated generating systems by considering the support components of the ZP elements with a given multicell domain

                     . This system, however, consists of functions that are defined on 
                        
                           
                              D

                      only. We will now use the refinability of ZP elements to construct decoupled functions that continuously extend the separated ones to

The construction of decoupled functions is visualized in Fig. 7. A ZP element of level 0, whose support is the entire octagon, is used to define two decoupled functions according to (11). This element possesses two support components. The ZP element is represented as a linear combination of 12 ZP elements of level 1 with coefficients shown in the circles, which are then grouped according to the associated support components. The green and blue coefficients correspond to the left and the upper right support component. The supports of the elements associated with the red coefficients do not intersect

                     . Consequently, we obtain two decoupled functions in this case, the supports of which (hatched regions) are shown in green and blue.

                      shows an adaptively refined triangulation and the supports (red and green regions) of the two partial chessboards of level 1 defined on it. The colored circles (blue/green and red/yellow, respectively) correspond to the decoupled functions in the sets

                      uses the selection mechanism, which was introduced in Kraft (1997) to define a basis for hierarchical B-splines. We generalize this mechanism by applying it to decoupled functions and enriching the result with partial chessboards.

We need to assume – in addition to SIC, which is required by the definition of the EDHGS – that the multicell domains

                           is an admissible multicell domain of level ℓ.
                        


                     
                        Proof
                        The proof is inspired by that of Theorem 20 by Giannelli and Jüttler (2013). The EDHGS, however, is not linearly independent, thus the original proof does not apply directly.

                            as well. Moreover, the theorem can be extended to non-enriched non-decoupled hierarchical generating systems by assuming a stronger version of SIC.

The assumption of Theorem 16 that each difference set

                      is an admissible multicell domain implies that each 
                        
                           
                              Ω

                      is required to be connected to the boundary. This could be guaranteed by choosing a refinement strategy that always generates a thin stripe connecting the refined domain to the boundary. Thanks to the decoupling, it suffices to choose the width of this stripe as one cell of level ℓ. Fig. 11
                      (left) shows domains selected for refinement to level 1 and 2 (light and dark gray, respectively) as well as the stripes added to reach the boundary.

Finally, we present an example to show that the assumptions of Theorem 16 are indeed necessary for completeness of the EDHGS.


                     
                        Example 18
                        We consider the adaptively refined triangulation shown in Fig. 11 (right). The function, which is defined as the linear combination of the 8 ZP elements of level 1 with the coefficients specified in the picture, has been constructed by representing the function from Example 9 in the next finer level, using the refinement coefficients shown in Fig. 7. It clearly belongs to the multilevel spline space, since its restriction to 
                              
                                 
                                    Δ

                            is equal to the function from Example 9 and it also obviously belongs to

                                    2

                              (
                              
                                 
                                    Δ
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              )
                           , as it is a linear combination of level 1 ZP elements. However, it does not admit a representation with respect to the EDHGS, cf. Example 9. ⋄

Adding the function from this example to the EDHGS resolves the completeness problem in this specific case. We conjecture that this idea can be extended to more general configurations, thereby eliminating the assumption regarding the admissibility of the difference sets. A more detailed investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of the current paper.

                            which equals zero everywhere (on k) according to Lemma 6.

Secondly, considering the right-hand side (20) again for general arguments (i.e., also outside k), we express it in terms of ZP elements of the next finer level 
                              ℓ
                              +
                              1
                            using the refinement relation (11). This representation involves only ZP elements of level 
                              ℓ
                              +
                              1
                            with supports that intersect k, due to the definition of the decoupled functions (11) and the partial chessboards (14). The coefficients of these ZP functions of level 
                              ℓ
                              +
                              1
                           , however, are obtained by refining the chessboard pattern (21), and this is known to produce zero coefficients only (Zore and Jüttler, 2014, Example 22). This completes the proof.  □

The equations in Lemma 19 are instances of evaluations of linearly independent LDRs. The linear independence is obvious since the equations involve mutually disjoint sets of coefficients. We will refer to them as Linear Dependency Generators (LDGs).

An example for LDGs of level 
                        ℓ
                        =
                        1
                      is shown in Fig. 12
                     . Two such LDGs are obtained in this case, since 
                        S
                        (
                        
                           
                              D
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                        )
                      possesses two connected components (shown in gray). The LDG on the left connected component involves two partial chessboards (visualized by the red dots that represent the participating decoupled functions) and 76 decoupled functions (represented by blue dots). The other LDG involves 48 decoupled functions (represented by green dots) but no partial chessboard. In total, we get two LDGs of level 0 (each involving 18 decoupled functions but no partial chessboard), two of level 1 and one of level 2 (involving two partial chessboards and 88 decoupled functions) in this situation.

We show that the system of LDGs from Lemma 19 forms a basis of the space of LDRs. Consequently, the number of LDRs equals

                           , but no partial chessboards. Invoking Lemma 6 confirms that the associated coefficients are a multiple of the corresponding LDG.

We now continue by considering the levels ℓ from 0 to 
                              N
                              −
                              1
                            and visiting one connected component k after the other. In each step we prove that the associated coefficients are a multiple of the corresponding LDG. This is possible since the coefficients of the previously considered decoupled functions and partial chessboards have been chosen so that their sum is equal to zero (as they are linear combinations of LDGs) and the supports of the remaining decoupled functions and partial chessboards do not intersect k.

Consequently, the only functions that are active on k are the decoupled functions

                      In particular, this agrees with the observation that there is exactly one LDR among the separated functions of one level on a simply connected domain.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We defined the enriched decoupled hierarchical generating system (EDHGS) of ZP elements on adaptively refined criss-cross triangulations. The definition assumes that the subdomains – which represent the regions selected for refinement to a certain level – are chosen such that the resulting difference sets satisfy SIC. This assumption can be ensured by always refining sufficiently wide subdomains.

The completeness of the EDHGS was proved under an additional assumption. More precisely, the difference sets need to be admissible. This condition is fulfilled if each component of the refined area is connected to the boundary of the domain.

In addition, we studied the linear dependencies that are present in the EDHGS. They can be controlled easily and linear independence can be restored by simply eliminating one of the functions involved in each of the linear dependency generators, which have been identified. Combining this with the completeness result allows to compute the dimension of the multilevel spline space.

Future work may be devoted to the generalization of our approach to other classes of box splines.
