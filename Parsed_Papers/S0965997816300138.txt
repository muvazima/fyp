                  This paper examines the enhancement of static and dynamic travel range of electrostatically driven microbeams using shape optimization approach. Continuous functions of width and thickness are used for optimizing the geometry of both cantilever and fixed–fixed microbeams. Rayleigh–Ritz energy method is employed to compute the static and dynamic pull-in parameters. Particle swarm optimization and hybrid simulated annealing are used for shape optimization of microbeams. Constraints on design variables are imposed using penalty approach. Enhanced pull-in parameters obtained for variable geometry microbeams have been validated using 3-D finite element analysis. Optimized shapes of microbeams show significant improvement in static and dynamic travel range. Pull-in displacement is increased up to 54.92% for cantilever microbeam and 40.79% for fixed–fixed microbeam with hybrid simulated annealing. Effectiveness of particle swarm optimization is brought out through representative test cases. The convergence of the particle swarm optimization is approximately five times faster as compared to the hybrid simulated annealing, while maintaining the same level of accuracy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Electrostatically driven micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) devices are attracting widespread interest of engineers and researchers due to promising scaling properties, high energy density and low power consumption [1,2]. Electrostatically driven microbeams, which act as actuators have many practical applications such as microgrippers, microswitches, microrelays, sensors, etc. [3]. The major restriction on the use of electrostatically driven microbeams is the operational instability known as pull-in instability, which was experimentally first observed by Nathanson [4] and Taylor [5]. The pull-in instability occurs when electrostatic force goes beyond elastic restoring force of the structure which leads to sudden contact of structure with substrate and the device becomes nonfunctional. The critical value of voltage at which pull-in instability occurs is called pull-in voltage and the corresponding displacement of the structure is called pull-in displacement. Together they are known as pull-in parameters.

As pull-in represents an operational doorstep for the MEMS system, an accurate estimation of pull-in parameters is crucial at the design stage of electrostatically driven MEMS devices [6–8]. Pull-in is desirable in applications like material property extraction [9] and switching operations [10]. However, it is detrimental to many applications like micromirror [11], biosensors [12,13], microresonators [14] and tuning of Atomic force microscope optical levers [15]. The motivation of the present investigation is to delay the occurrence of pull-in instability of electrostatically driven MEMS actuators for improving the device performance.

Detailed description of modeling of electrostatically driven microactuator is given in the articles of Lee [16] and Batra et al. [17]. Microactuator can be mathematically modeled using the Galerkin’s method based reduced order model (ROM) [18,19]. Among electrostatically driven MEMS devices, fixed-fixed microbeams and cantilever microbeams are widely used and their pull-in instability has been thoroughly studied by various researchers. Hence, microactuators in the present analysis are modeled as fixed–fixed microbeam and cantilever microbeam. Dimensions of the microbeams under investigation indicate that computationally efficient Galerkin’s reduced order model can be used in the present analysis and the Rayleigh–Ritz energy based method as a solver. ROM is specially preferred for design optimization problems where repetitive analysis has to be carried out by an optimization algorithm until the objective function is extremized.

It is well known that when the applied voltage is raised gradually, inertia of the structure becomes negligible for the system behavior. The critical value of voltage at this point is known as static pull-in voltage and the distance traveled by the tip of cantilever microbeam and mid point of the fixed–fixed microbeam is called as static travel range or static pull-in displacement [20]. Many researchers have presented the pull-in phenomenon and the methods to estimate the stability of static deflection of the beam type microactuators [21]. The stability of motion around deformed position of the electrode is addressed and this is particularly important since the behavior of these devices is non linear [2,22]. Therefore, there is a chance for a dynamic instability to provoke pull-in called dynamic pull-in, below the static instability limit of voltage [23]. The pull-in instability of the system in this situation is called as dynamic pull-in instability. Maximum static pull-in displacement of prismatic cantilever microbeam and fixed–fixed microbeam with rectangular cross-section is 45% and 40% of initial gap respectively.

Electrostatic force distribution and mechanical stiffness of the structure are influenced by the shape of microbeams. Hence, shape optimization is most popular passive method to enhance the travel range of microbeams. Various researchers presented their study carried out in the past on the performance improvement of MEMS devices through shape variations. For example Abdalla et al. [24] optimized shape of microbeams for maximization of pull-in voltage. Lake et al. used optimization method for design of slotted MEMS resonator [25]. Joglekar and Pawaskar [26] used shape optimization using Nelder–Mead algorithm for performance improvement of the electrostatically driven microactuators. However, they did not account dielectric breakdown voltage as limiting voltage for actuation of MEMS devices which is one of the important constraint of electrostatic MEMS devices. Moreover, the rise in pull-in displacement is limited compared to its referential prismatic microbeams because of constant thickness or constant width while varying the geometry [27]. In the present study, an attempt is made to vary width and thickness of variable geometry microbeams using parametric functions to enhance the stable travel range of the device. To this end, hybrid simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization methods are used for shape optimization. Penalty approach for violation of constraints is employed.

Aim of this paper is to present the conceptually novel design of electrostatically driven microbeams having enhanced travel range by shape optimization exploiting initial gap. While optimizing the shape, rise in applied voltage is limited by dielectric breakdown voltage [28].

In the present paper, static and dynamic pull-in instability of microbeams subjected to DC step voltage is addressed. For structural analysis, Rayleigh–Ritz energy method, including various source of nonlinearity such as electrostatic force, midplane stretching and fringing field effect, is used for estimation of pull-in parameters. Reduced order model based on Galerkin’s approach is used for numerical solution of equations. Hybrid simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization are used for shape optimization of microbeams. Dielectric breakdown voltage is considered as upper limit of the rise in voltage. For prismatic microbeams, pull-in parameters are compared with experimental and numerical findings. Estimated pull-in parameters of variable geometry optimized microbeams are compared with 3-D finite element simulation package COMSOLTM

                     . When a step voltage is applied between fixed and deformable electrode, attractive electrostatic force causes deflection of microbeam. Beyond a critical value of voltage, deformable electrode snaps the fixed electrode, resulting in collapse of the device. Value of voltage and the deformation at this point is calculated using Rayleigh–Ritz energy method. For analysis, potential energy of the system consist of following terms:

                         is calculated numerically at static pull-in point. Subscript ‘ps’ represents pull-in in static mode.

In dynamic mode due to sudden rise in voltage, deflection of microbeam becomes a function of time and space represented as w(x, t). Energy method is used for estimating dynamic pull-un parameters of parallel plates and torsional plates MEMS devices by Nelson and Barbastathis [33] followed by Joglekar and Pawaskar [26] for variable width microbeams. Approximation of deflection of microbeams w(x, t)  in dynamic operating condition is assumed by the Eq. (13).

Response of the electrostatically driven MEMS devices up to dynamic pull-in voltage is periodic [26,32] and at pull-in point, velocity becomes zero, beyond pull-in response becomes non-periodic. For extracting dynamic pull-in parameters, conditions expressed in Eq. (15) hold true,

Dynamic pull-in parameters are estimated by solving Eq. (15) numerically using code developed in MATLABTM. In Section 3.3, pull-in parameters estimated using energy method are compared with data in the literature. For referential prismatic microbeams and variable geometry microbeams results are compared with 3-D simulation package COMSOLTM.


                        Table 1
                         shows comparison of pull-in voltage of prismatic microbeams, reported by various researchers with the pull-in voltage obtained by Rayleigh–Ritz energy method. The values of pull-in parameters estimated from code developed in MATLABTM show excellent agreement with the literature. In Table 1, only values of pull-in voltage are compared, pull-in displacement value is not mentioned by many researchers in their study.

In addition to the comparison of pull-in parameters of prismatic microbeam, results are validated with 3-D FEA simulation using COMSOLTM MEMS multiphysics [29] module. Values of estimated pull-in parameters using energy method and 3-D FEA is presented in Table 2
                        . Estimated pull-in parameters show good agreement with those obtained from 3-D FEA COMSOLTM
                     

Optimization problem under investigation is solved for selecting the best design of microbeams having maximum pull-in displacement. Appropriate side constraints, geometric constraints and behavior constraints are implemented through penalty approach. The minimum width and thickness constraints has been adopted from the handbook of design rules for PolyMUMPS [40]. Study on micromachining using gray scale lithography along with dry anisotropic etching presented by Waits et al. [41] indicates that present microfabrication facility is capable of generating the complicated 3-D features from silicon structures. To restate the objective of this paper for quick reference, the aim of this is to arrive at the width and thickness profiles which can maximize the pull-in displacement keeping the area of overlap and volume of the microbeam same as that of referential prismatic microbeam. Continuous width and thickness functions are used for varying width and thickness along the length. For cantilever microbeam it is mathematically expressed as,

                         for fixed–fixed microbeam, in order to keep symmetry of loading and boundary conditions. This will rest assure that torsion and bending effects are not asymmetrical. Here, constraints on each design parameters is imposed to avoid non realistic solutions. Maximum and minimum width as well as thickness value is decided on the basis of dimensions of the microbeam available in the literature and minimum feature size which can be fabricated using microfabrication facilities. It is obvious that rise in pull-in displacement will bring rise in actuation voltage. For MEMS devices, rise in actuation voltage is restricted by the dielectric breakdown voltage of the fluid present between the two electrodes. In the present case, dielectric medium is taken as air, Paschen’s law of breakdown voltage is not applicable when the gap between two electrode is less than  4 µm [28]. Modified Paschen’s curve for the initial gap than 5 µ indicates, there is a low risk if the breakdown voltage is set approximately 50 V/µ [42]. Following equations represent objective function and equality and inequality constraints in normalized form.

In the Eq. (18), f represents objective function with design vector Y and wps
                         is the pull-in displacement in static mode, wpd
                         is the pull-in displacement in dynamic mode, to be maximized. Term P and C with different subscripts show penalties and cost for violating constraints respectively. For example, term Parea
                         and Carea
                         represents penalty and cost for violating constant area of overlap. Expression for penalty and cost of violation of different constraints are mathematically represented as follows:

                           
                              i.
                              The term Parea
                                  specifies the penalty for violation of constant area of overlap of the variable geometry microbeam.

Swarm intelligence (SI) is a very wide research domain of optimization and several algorithms have been developed under the roof of SI to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. Particle swarm optimization was developed by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995, which models social behavior of bird flocking in search of food [43,44]. In PSO, system starts with a random set of solutions and searches for optimum value by updating generations. Each candidate solution is known as particle and set of particles is called as swarm, moves in n- dimensional search space in a cooperative manner. Movement of each particle in swarm is performed by a variable called velocity, that is influenced by a local and a social factor [45]. Each particle moves through search space based on the best positions found so far by itself Pbest
                         and the best position found by the swarm i.e. global best Gbest
                        . Objective function (fitness function) value is calculated for each particle p in the search space Rn
                        . Position and velocity of each particle at ith iteration is S(i) and Vel(i) respectively. Movement of each particle in PSO is influenced by three factors (i) Particle’s own direction search (ii) Best position of the particle itself (iii) Best position found by the whole swarm. After every iteration position and velocity of every particle is updated using equation

In this section, results
                     
                     
                      obtained using particle swarm optimization and hybrid simulated annealing for optimizing pull-in displacement using Eq. (18) are discussed. For generalization purpose, nine representative test cases for fixed–fixed and cantilever microbeam are considered. Upper and lower limit of geometrical dimensions of microbeam for each test case is shown in Table 3
                     .

Width and thickness constraints in normalized form are chosen from the prismatic beam dimensions available in various research articles [6,9,26]. Nomenclature for various test cases of microbeam is as follows, S indicates static mode and D represents dynamic mode of actuation. Numerals represents row number of the Table 3. Here row number indicates geometric constraints for the respective test case, for example, S1 represents static mode of actuation having geometric constraints defined in row number 1 of Table 3. Similarly, D3 represents dynamic mode of actuation having constraints corresponding to row number 3 of Table 3.

Normalized value of width and thickness for referential prismatic beam is chosen as

The choice of selecting the swarm size is user dependant and problem specific. The swarm size is decided on the basis of numerical experiment carried out for one of the representative test cases (test case S9 for cantilever).

The swarm size dependency shown in Fig. 2 clearly indicates that the maximum pull-in displacement value obtained using swarm size 10, 15, 20 and 25 can be improved by increasing the swarm size. If the swarm size is increased beyond 30, not much improvement is observed in the maximum pull-in displacement value. Therefore, in order to save computational effort without compromising the accuracy of results, swarm size is decided as 30.

Pull-in displacement is optimized in static and dynamic operating conditions of cantilever and fixed–fixed microbeam discussed separately in the following sections.

In this section, the optimized design variables and enhanced pull-in parameters obtained using PSO and HSA are compared for each test cases of cantilever microbeam. Both static and dynamic behavior is analyzed for cantilever microbeams.


                           Table 4
                            shows the comparison of the optimized design parameters and static pull-in parameters for cantilever microbeam using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and hybrid simulated annealing (HSA) algorithm.

As shown in Table 4 parameters using both the optimization techniques are compared for each test case. Nomenclature of test case is as follows. For example, in test case if it is written as S2 (PSO) it means that it is static test case having geometric dimension limits defined in row no 2 of Table 3 and design variables are optimized using particle swarm optimization. It is clear from the Table 3 that by using PSO, static pull-in displacement is maximum for test case S3, which indicates 54.32% rise in pull-in displacement as compared to referential prismatic microbeam. While implementing hybrid simulated annealing, the results show that maximum rise in static pull-in displacement is 54.92% for test case S3.


                           Table 5
                            presents optimized design variables and dynamic pull-in parameter for test cases D1 to D9 for cantilever microbeam.

As presented in Table 5, while employing particle swarm optimization, maximum rise in dynamic pull-in displacement is 49.90% for test case D3. On parallel lines, using hybrid simulated annealing, increment in dynamic travel range is 49.81% for test case D2. Test cases having maximum range for thickness and width have shown significant improvement in the pull-in displacement in static and dynamic operating conditions. Width and thickness profiles of cantilever microbeams, optimized in static and dynamic operating conditions show striking similarity in most of the test cases. Optimized width and thickness profiles of cantilever microbeam in dynamic operating condition using PSO and HSA are shown in Fig. 3.

Convergence criteria for the optimization problem is set as follows:

If the difference of the objective function value of two consecutive iterations is less than or equal to 
                              
                                 10
                                 
                                    −
                                    7
                                 
                              
                           (value of function tolerance), the optimization algorithm will stop iterations and the minimum value of the objective function is reported as optimized value. Convergence graphs for test case S9 is shown in Fig. 5a for PSO and for HSA is shown in Fig. 5c for cantilever. It clearly indicates that solution converges around 5000 iterations using PSO, which is almost 5 times faster than those obtained using HSA. It is depicted from convergence graph that hybrid simulated annealing is one of the alternatives among the optimization algorithms for the problem under investigation. Solution using HSA is converged in around 32000–38000 iterations. Width and thickness profiles of cantilever microbeam show striking similarity in most of the test cases.

In this section, for fixed–fixed microbeam, the optimized pull-in parameters using PSO and HSA are compared for 9 different test cases in static and dynamic operating conditions.

Results of fixed–fixed microbeam for static operating condition is shown in Table 6
                           . It shows that using PSO, maximum pull-in displacement is observed in test case S3 showing 34.20% rise as compared to referential prismatic fixed-fixed microbeam. On parallel lines, shape optimization using hybrid simulated annealing indicate that static travel range is maximum in test case S2 and it is increased by 40.79% compared to prismatic fixed–fixed microbeam.


                           Table 7
                            shows the comparison of the optimized design and pull-in parameters for fixed–fixed microbeam using particle swarm optimization and hybrid simulated annealing optimization techniques in dynamic operating condition. In dynamic mode of actuation, shape optimization using PSO show 39.15% rise in travel range for the test case D2. While shape optimization using hybrid simulated annealing indicate 38.76% rise in dynamic pull-in displacement for test case D2.

Comparison of optimized width and thickness profiles of fixed–fixed microbeam using PSO and HSA in dynamic operating condition is shown in Fig. 4.

Width and thickness profiles of various test cases show close proximity with those obtained from hybrid SA. Convergence graph for test case S9 of fixed–fixed microbeam using PSO is shown in Fig. 5b. The graph of convergence using hybrid simulated annealing is shown in Fig. 5d for the test case S9. Hybrid simulated annealing provides a successful method for the problem under investigation. Hybrid SA converges after 32000–38000 iterations. This converged solution should avoid local minimum and provide a good approximation of a global optimum. The major drawback in using HSA is that it takes significant computational time to converge.

Varying width and thickness simultaneously using parametric functions has shown significant improvement than those obtained using the variable width microbeams. Joglekar and Pawaskar reported the enhancement in pull-in displacement using variable width and constant thickness geometry. Using the same constraints on width, area of overlap and constant volume, the pull-in parameters are compared for each test cases in Tables.

Optimized pull-in parameters for variable geometry microbeam is validated using 3-D finite element analysis software COMSOLTM 
                           [29] in multiphysics mode. Deformable electrode is modeled as structural domain in COMSOLTM which uses Arbitrary Euclarian Lagrangian (ALE) method to calculate the deformation due to electric field. Electrostatic domain is defined by box surrounding the deformable electrode which transfers the load to deformable electrode. Results of prismatic microbeam and variable geometry microbeam using proposed energy method and COMSOLTM is compared in Table 2 and it shows predicted results for static test case S9 is having less than 2% difference with those obtained from COMSOLTM. For 3-D FEA, half symmetry model is considered to save computational effort. Deformation contour in static operating condition is shown in Fig. 6 for both microbeams.

Voltage-displacement graphs for cantilever and fixed–fixed microbeam are shown in Fig. 7
                            which reconfirms pull-in parameters estimated from energy method are in close proximity with the COMSOLTM 3-D FEA package.

To validate the dynamic pull-in parameters, time history diagrams of optimized microbeams developed using MATLABTM code are compared with those obtained from with 3-D FEA simulation package COMSOLTM. As shown in Fig. 8
                           , estimated response of the microbeams at various voltage is showing close match with 3-D FEA software results.

Optimized design parameters for static and dynamic pull-in displacement using hybrid simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are summarized by following important points

                              
                                 •
                                 Using particle swarm optimization, maximum rise in static pull-in displacement is observed as 54.32% for test case S3 and dynamic pull-in displacement is raised by 49.90% in test case D3.

Application of PSO for shape optimization of fixed–fixed microbeam show rise in static pull-in displacement by 34.20% for test case S3 and 39.15% rise in dynamic pull-in displacement for test case D2.

Using particle swarm optimization, results are converged within the range of 5000–6000 iterations for all the test cases of fixed–fixed and cantilever microbeam.

Using hybrid simulated annealing, for optimized cantilever microbeam, maximum rise of 54.92% of static pull-in displacement is obtained for test case S3. Similarly, for dynamic pull-in maximum rise of 49.81% is obtained for test case D2.

Out of 9 static test cases of cantilever microbeam, optimized pull-in parameters of test case S4 using PSO shows rise in pull-in displacement as 24.55% and those obtained using HSA is 33.43% which shows significant difference in the results using both the methods. Here, hybrid SA though taking long time is giving better results.

Out of 9 static test cases of fixed–fixed microbeam, optimized pull-in parameters of test case S2 using PSO shows rise in pull-in displacement as 32.10% and those obtained using HSA is 40.79% which shows considerable difference in the results using both the methods.

Shape optimization of fixed–fixed microbeam using hybrid simulated annealing shows maximum rise in static pull-in displacement which is of 40.79% in test case S2 while, in dynamic pull-in displacement 38.76% rise is obtained in test case D2.

To get the convergence of design variables using hybrid simulated annealing method around 32000–38000 iterations are required for various test cases of microbeams.

Estimated static pull-in parameters for fixed–fixed and cantilever microbeam are compared with the 3-D FEA package COMSOLTM results, shows less than 2% variation in the estimated results.

Validation of dynamic pull-in parameters is demonstrated by comparing time history for both the microbeams for representative test case D9.

Various test cases are presented to demonstrate the applicability of particle swarm optimization and hybrid simulated annealing method for shape optimization of electrostatically actuated microbeams.

In this paper, novel design of electrostatically driven microbeams is presented for enhancement of travel range. Shape optimization of microbeams for enhanced travel range is carried out successfully using PSO and hybrid SA. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first instance of PSO being used for optimizing a width and a thickness profiles for travel range enhancement of electrostatically driven microbeams. From the presented results,following conclusions can be drawn:

                        
                           •
                           Particle swarm optimization is successfully applied for shape optimization of electrostatically driven microbeams and it is almost five times faster than hybrid simulated annealing.

Pull-in parameters are more sensitive to thickness variation than width variation. Since constant area and volume constraints are imposed, more material is deposited towards the fixed end of the microbeam, which causes rise in the flexural rigidity and ultimately leads to increase in actuation voltage. A similar phenomenon is also reported by many researchers in the past like, Abdalla et al. [24], Najar et al. [51], and Joglekar and Pawaskar [52].

Width and thickness profiles obtained using PSO show striking similarity with those obtained using hybrid SA. Similarly pull-in displacements obtained using PSO show close proximity with the hybrid SA in most of the test cases. Moreover, using PSO, computation effort is reduced drastically without significant lose in the results of pull-in displacement in static and dynamic operating condition.

Out of 18 (9 static and 9 dynamic) test cases optimized using PSO for cantilever microbeam, pull-in displacement results are having approximately 1% difference with the respective test cases optimized using hybrid SA except for test case S4. For test case S4, hybrid simulated annealing outperform the particle swarm optimization.

Out of 18 (9 static and 9 dynamic) test cases optimized using PSO for fixed–fixed microbeam, results of PSO show significant difference for static test case S2 from HSA. In this test case, HSA proves to be better.

Design parameters obtained under static operating conditions for cantilever and fixed–fixed microbeams are quite close to optimized design parameters of respective beams obtained under dynamic operating conditions for most of the test cases.

Optimized pull-in parameters obtained in the present investigation compare well with 3-D finite element analysis model which helps in building confidence in use of the presently used numerical method.

Constraints of microfabrication can be added in the present investigation.
