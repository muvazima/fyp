                  In real-world applications of optimization, optimal solutions are often of limited value, because disturbances of or changes to input data may diminish the quality of an optimal solution or even render it infeasible. One way to deal with uncertain input data is robust optimization, the aim of which is to find solutions which remain feasible and of good quality for all possible scenarios, i.e., realizations of the uncertain data. For single objective optimization, several definitions of robustness have been thoroughly analyzed and robust optimization methods have been developed. In this paper, we extend the concept of minmax robustness (Ben-Tal, Ghaoui, & Nemirovski, 2009) to multi-objective optimization and call this extension robust efficiency for uncertain multi-objective optimization problems. We use ingredients from robust (single objective) and (deterministic) multi-objective optimization to gain insight into the new area of robust multi-objective optimization. We analyze the new concept and discuss how robust solutions of multi-objective optimization problems may be computed. To this end, we use techniques from both robust (single objective) and (deterministic) multi-objective optimization. The new concepts are illustrated with some linear and quadratic programming instances.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

There is a still a gap between theory and practice in optimization, being evident in the fact that optimization methods are still not used for many real-world problems for which they could make an impact. Among others, there are two reasons why mathematical optimization does often not lead to solutions that are applicable in practice: First, most real-world problems are of multi-objective nature, and second, the input data is often not known beforehand. Both aspects have been considered extensively in multi-objective and in robust optimization. However, the combination of both aspects has not been well researched so far.

As an example, consider the well known shortest-path problem: In this problem one often has multiple objectives such as the length of the path and its costs (as studied for more than 30years, e.g., Martins, 1984). Additionally, arc lengths might be uncertain (compare, e.g., Aissi, Bazgan, & Vanderpooten, 2009; Yu & Yang, 1998) due to unknown traffic conditions, and costs might be unknown since they depend, e.g., on fuel prices. Shortest path problems have many applications, for example, they can be used to compute passengers’ paths in timetable information systems. Within this setting, multiple criteria refer to the length of the journey, its price, or to the number of transfers, and have been algorithmically treated in Disser, Müller-Hannemann, and Schnee (2008) and Müller-Hannemann and Schnee (2007). On the other hand, timetable information has also been studied under uncertainties which are given by unknown delays in public transportation (Goerigk, Heße, Müller-Hannemann, Schmidt, & Schöbel, 2013; Goerigk, Knoth, Müller-Hannemann, Schmidt, & Schöbel, 2013). However, an uncertain and multi-objective formulation has not been presented so far. In this paper we propose the concept of robust efficiency in order to handle uncertainties in general multi-objective optimization problems.

For estimating the effects of uncertainties, it is necessary to evaluate how sensitive an (optimal) solution is to disturbances of the input data. In the literature on single objective optimization, this is often done as an a posteriori step called sensitivity analysis (for an overview see Saltelli, Chan, & Scott (2000)). Sensitivity analysis provides ranges for input data within which a solution remains feasible or optimal. It does not, however, provide a course of action for changing a solution should the disturbance be outside these ranges. In contrast, stochastic programming and robust optimization techniques take the uncertainty into account during the optimization process in single objective optimization. While stochastic programming (see Birge & Louveaux (2011) for an introduction) minimizes the expected objective value of the solution based on a probability distribution of the uncertain data, robust optimization hedges against the worst case. Hence it does not require any probabilistic information. Whether robust or stochastic optimization is the more appropriate way of dealing with uncertainty usually depends on the application.

Robust optimization is applied to problems where a solution is required which hedges against all possible scenarios, i.e., realizations of the uncertain input data. For single objective optimization problems, many different approaches to model robustness have been suggested in the literature. Minmax robustness (also called strict robustness) has been first mentioned in Soyster (1973) and has been extensively researched, see, e.g., Ben-Tal et al. (2009) for many results. It requires that a solution should be feasible no matter what happens, i.e., for all possible scenarios, and aims at minimizing the objective function in the worst case. A second prominent concept is to minimize the worst case regret as suggested, e.g., in Kouvelis and Yu (1997). Since both of these concepts are rather conservative, alternative concepts have recently been proposed in the literature. See the overview in Goerigk and Schöbel (2013).

As pointed out before, many real world optimization problems require the minimization of multiple conflicting objectives (Stewart et al., 2008), e.g., the minimization of production time versus the minimization of the cost of manufacturing equipment, or the maximization of tumour control versus the minimization of normal tissue complication in radiotherapy treatment design. Naturally, the issue of uncertain data affects these multi-objective optimization problems in the same way that it affects single objective ones. Therefore, being able to find robust efficient solutions would be very valuable in these applications. While the need for dealing with uncertainty in multi-objective optimization has been realized, hardly any of the classical robustness concepts have been extended and applied to multi-objective optimization problems. Most of the research in this area m rather deals with Branke’s concept of robustness for single objective optimization (Branke, 1998). He proposes to replace the objective function f by its mean function 
                        
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        
                      which maps any point x to the average function value in a pre-defined neighbourhood of x. A minimizer of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        
                      is then more robust than a minimizer of f in the sense that the function values in its neighbourhood do not change too much.

Based on Branke’s idea for single objective optimization problems, Deb and Gupta (2006) introduce two concepts of robustness for multi-objective optimization problems. The first one replaces all objective functions by their mean functions as Branke (1998) does for single objective optimization problems. Efficient solutions to the resulting optimization problem are called robust solutions of the original problem. Deb and Gupta’s second concept minimizes the original objective functions but adds constraints to the problem that restrict the variation between the original objective functions and their mean functions to a predefined limit. The latter approach proves to be more pragmatic and enables the user to control the desired level of robustness.


                     Barrico and Antunes (2006) extend Deb and Gupta’s first concept by introducing the degree of robustness of a solution. This concept uses a predefined neighbourhood of a feasible solution and measures how much this neighbourhood can be extended without containing solutions whose function values vary from the function value of the original solution by a predefined ratio. Gunawan and Azarm (2005) measure robustness for multi-objective optimization problems by a so called sensitivity region in the space of the uncertain parameters. This region defines the allowed variation of the uncertain parameters without violation of predefined variation constraints of the objective functions. Since the sensitivity region may be asymmetric, Gunawan and Azarm (2005) introduce a worst-case-sensitivity region by fitting a ball of maximal radius around the undisturbed scenario into this region. More detailed overviews of these robustness concepts for multi-objective optimization problems can be found in Steponavice and Miettinen (2012) and Witting (2012).

There are not many extensions of the classical concepts of robustness from single objective to multi-objective optimization problems. While in single objective uncertain optimization the concept of minmax robustness has been extensively studied (see, e.g., Ben-Tal & Nemirovski, 1998; Ghaoui & Lebret, 1997; Soyster, 1973) for older contributions and Ben-Tal et al. (2009) for a recent survey, no general extension to multi-objective optimization exists. However, very recently, research interest on minmax robustness for multi-objective optimization can be observed. In a first approach, Kuroiwa and Lee (2012) extended the concept of minmax robustness to multi-objective optimization problems by replacing the objective vector of the uncertain multi-objective optimization problem by the vector consisting of the worst cases of the respective components. Other publications consider similar concepts of robustness. Fliege and Werner (2013) apply the same concept to portfolio selection problems, Yu and Liu (2013) apply it to an uncertain multi-objective game theory problem, and Chen et al. (2012) discuss uncertain multi-objective optimization problems with application in proton therapy for cancer treatment and use the same concept for handling the uncertainties. However, this approach is a bit restrictive and does not completely reflect the variety of multi-objective solutions as we will see later on in this paper.


                     Doolittle, Kerivin, and Wiecek (2012) follow a similar approach as Kuroiwa and Lee (2012). The authors reformulate the uncertain multi-objective optimization problem by replacing each of the objective functions by a new variable and adding additional constraints to the problem formulation (cf. the same approach for single-objective optimization problems in Ben-Tal & Nemirovski (1998)). This approach results in the same concept as presented by Kuroiwa and Lee (2012).

Another interpretation of minmax robustness for uncertain multi-objective optimization problems has been introduced by Avigad and Branke (2008) who present an evolutionary algorithm to find solutions to unconstrained uncertain multi-objective optimization problems. They interpret the worst case objective vectors for a given solution to an uncertain multi-objective optimization problem as the set of efficient solutions to the problem of maximizing the objective function at the considered solution over the uncertainty set. The concepts we present in this paper follow a similar approach.

In this paper we extend the concept of minmax robustness from single objective to multi-objective optimization in a general way. First applications of our new approach have been described in cutting stock optimization (Ide, Tiedemann, Westphal, & Haiduk, 2013) and in Kuhn, Raith, Schmidt, and Schöbel (2012) where a special bi-objective shortest path problem is considered under uncertainty, and applications in aircraft routing with uncertain weather conditions and transportation of hazardous materials are mentioned.

After introducing the necessary preliminaries from multi-objective and robust optimization we define a multi-objective uncertain optimization problem and its robust counterpart in Section ‘Robust counterparts of uncertain multi-objective optimization problems’. In Section ‘Finding robust efficient solutions for uncertain multi-objective optimization problems’ we apply both techniques from robust (single objective) and (deterministic) multi-objective optimization in order to find robust solutions of multi-objective optimization problems. The special case of uncertain multi-objective optimization problems in which the uncertain parameters in the different objective functions are independent of each other is investigated in Section ‘Objective-wise uncertainty’. First insights into the complexity of the concepts of the paper are given in Section ‘Illustrations of robust efficient solutions’ using linear and quadratic optimization instances. The paper ends with some conclusions and suggestions for further research in Section ‘Conclusion’.

We recall some notation of multi-objective optimization used in this paper. Multi-objective optimization deals with the problem of minimizing a function 
                           
                              f

Throughout the paper we have to distinguish between these three relations in proofs and theorems. Since most of the proofs and theorems are formulated analogously for each relation, we shorten the text by using a [././.] notation. Furthermore, we define the cones

Since an uncertain optimization problem is defined as a family of optimization problems with different objective functions defined by each scenario 
                           
                              ξ

                        , we need to clarify how to evaluate a feasible solution, i.e., which feasible solutions 
                           
                              x
                              ∈
                              X
                           
                         are considered robust optimal solutions of the uncertain optimization problem. This depends on the definition of robustness. As indicated in Section ‘Introduction’, many different concepts of robustness, interpreting optimality for an uncertain optimization problem, can be found in the literature. In this paper we concentrate on the concept of minmax robustness introduced by Soyster (1973), and extensively studied by, e.g., Ben-Tal et al. (2009). This concept adopts a pessimistic point of view by trying to hedge against the worst case, i.e., the goal is to minimize the objective function for the worst case scenario over all feasible solutions. Having specified this goal, we can now transform the uncertain optimization problem into its so called robust counterpart which is a deterministic optimization problem. It can be written as

                        We call an optimal solution to this problem robust optimal.

We note that because the novelty considered in this paper concerns the multiple objectives, we will only consider uncertain objectives and assume the feasible set to be deterministic. We can do this without loss of generality for the problems considered in this paper because as done in the concept of minmax robustness, we only call a solution robust, if it is feasible for every scenario.

The goal of this section is to extend the concept of minmax robustness introduced in Section ‘Uncertain optimization problems and minmax robustness’ to multi-objective optimization problems. Assume that we are given a multi-objective optimization problem

Given an uncertain multi-objective optimization problem

                     , the same question as in single objective optimization arises, namely, how to evaluate feasible solutions 
                        
                           x

                     . In uncertain multi-objective optimization problems, we cannot evaluate solutions by just taking the worst case over all scenarios because we obtain a vector of objective values for each scenario. The set of objective values of x is

                     Lemmas 3.5 and 3.6 show that our concept of robust efficiency is sound, because in the cases where the problem reduces to a deterministic multi-objective optimization problem or to an uncertain single objective optimization problem, respectively, our new definitions turn out to be the common definitions of efficiency and robust optimality.

Having introduced the definition of robust efficient solutions for uncertain multi-objective optimization problems in Section ‘Robust counterparts of uncertain multi-objective optimization problems’, we now apply knowledge from deterministic multi-objective optimization (see Section ‘(Deterministic) multi-objective optimization’) and single objective robust optimization (see Section ‘Uncertain optimization problems and minmax robustness’) in order to find robust efficient solutions to an uncertain multi-objective optimization problem 
                        
                           P
                           (
                           U
                           )
                        
                     . Throughout this section we show that insights from deterministic multi-objective optimization can be extended to robust multi-objective optimization.

The most common approach to computing efficient solutions for a deterministic multi-objective optimization problem is the weighted sum scalarization. The general idea is to form a single objective optimization problem by multiplying each objective function with a non-negative weight and summing up the weighted objectives. The weighted sum problem

We now generalize the weighted sum scalarization by reducing the robust counterpart of an uncertain multi-objective optimization problem to a single objective uncertain optimization problem in order to be able to compute robust efficient solutions by computing robust optimal solutions of the uncertain single objective problem. To this end, we introduce the robust version of the weighted sum scalarization problem of an uncertain multi-objective optimization problem

Methods 1 and 2 are adaptations of well known scalarization methods from multi-objective optimization to uncertain multi-objective optimization problems. Therefore they require the solution of a single objective uncertain problem for each setting of the parameters 
                           
                              λ
                           
                        , respectively

                         and i. The next method in Section ‘Approach 3: Objective-wise worst case’ on the other hand, is the adaptation of a robust optimization technique to the uncertain multi-objective optimization problem

                         and results in the necessity to solve a deterministic multi-objective optimization problem.

Instead of interpreting the supremum in the robust counterpart of our uncertain multi-objective optimization problem 
                           
                              P

                         as a multi-objective maximization problem, we can also interpret it as a point rather than a set.

This definition has been motivated by the notion of constraint-wise uncertainty as considered, e.g., in Ben-Tal et al. (2009) and is likely to appear in practical instances, e.g., if the coefficients of the objective functions are noisy. We note that many studies on robustness deal with interval-wise uncertainty which is also assumed to be independent and hence a special case of our assumption. For the resulting class of problems we are able to obtain further results for computing robust efficient solutions.

The first important insight is that the existence of a worst case for every objective function

                        , does in fact imply that a worst case scenario exists for the uncertain multi-objective optimization problem

Recall that Example 4.9 shows that the 
                           
                              ∊
                           
                        -constraint method for uncertain multi-objective optimization problems need not find all re solutions. Nevertheless, Corollary 5.6 confirms that the 
                           
                              ∊
                           
                        -constraint method finds all re solutions for owu problems, just as in deterministic multi-objective optimization.

One goal in robust single objective optimization is to simplify the robust counterpart of an optimization problem in order to compute robust solutions. A general property is Theorem 5.7:

In Section ‘Finding robust efficient solutions for uncertain multi-objective optimization problems’ we extended results from deterministic multi-objective optimization. We now want to extend Theorem 5.7 from single objective robust optimization to robust multi-objective optimization. Such an extension is only possible for owu problems, as we shall see in Examples 5.10 and 5.11, Examples 5.12 and 5.13. Before we state a similar result to Theorem 5.7 we need a lemma.

Together with Section ‘Completeness of the objective-wise worst case method’ we can deduce that an owu problem 
                           
                              P
                              (

                              )
                              )
                           
                         is equivalent to the deterministic problem

                                    P
                                    (
                                    U
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                         with a considerably smaller uncertainty set 
                           
                              U
                           
                        . This smaller uncertainty set also simplifies the calculation of a worst case, especially since (due to Lemma 5.2) we can do this for each objective function at a time.

So far we introduced the concept of robust efficiency and presented various methods to compute robust efficient solutions. This raises many questions on the structure of the set of robust efficient solutions, e.g., if it forms a set of robust nond-dominated points on the boundary of the feasible set in objective space similar to the non-dominated set in deterministic multi-objective optimization, and where in the feasible set robust efficient solutions may be located.

Unfortunately, as demonstrated in the master thesis of Majewski (2013), it turns out that even in the case of multi-objective linear programming, the structure of robust efficient solutions does not satisfy well-known properties of deterministic multi-objective optimization.
                        
                           •
                           While in deterministic linear multi-objective optimization there always exists an efficient solution at an extreme point of the feasible set (compare, e.g., Ehrgott, 2005), this is not the case for robust efficient solutions in uncertain linear multi-objective optimization, not even for owu functions.

Even worse, there exist examples of uncertain bi-objective affine optimization problems on the box 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          [
                                          0
                                          ,
                                          1
                                          ]
                                       
                                       
                                          2
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               in which all robust efficient solutions lie in the interior of the feasible set; a situation which cannot occur in deterministic affine multi-objective programming (compare, e.g., Ehrgott, 2005).

Hence, general conclusions are difficult to be drawn and a general intuition of a robust efficient solution may be hard to obtain. However, we can illustrate the solutions found by the different methods for particular instances.

                      taken from the same set).

                     -constraint method in grey. As one can see on the left, the solutions obtained with Method 1 seem to lie on the boundary of the feasible set, while Method 2 also finds solutions in the interior of the feasible set.

In conclusion, robust efficient solutions can lie basically anywhere in the feasible set (even for uncertain multi-objective linear optimization problems) and none of our three methods is clearly superior to the others. These results highlight again the complexity of uncertain multi-objective optimization.

We finally present a bi-objective example in order to illustrate the advantages of using robust efficient solutions over optimal solutions to the various scenarios.


                     Fig. 11
                      illustrates a bi-objective convex quadratic optimization problem. We investigate two types of solutions. First, we choose one nominal scenario (which might be the undisturbed, or the most likely scenario) and compute the efficient solutions for this particular case. If the nominal scenario occurs this is the best we can do, and it is what is often done in practice: Choose the most likely scenario and solve the optimization problem with this fixed scenario. We call this set of solutions the nominally efficient solutions Nom. We then use the approach of our paper and compute robust efficient solutions Rob to the uncertain bi-objective convex quadratic optimization problem assuming six other scenarios. In Fig. 11 the objective vectors of nominally efficient solutions Nom and robust efficient solutions Rob are compared to each other as follows.
                        
                           •
                           
                              Fig. 11(a) shows the objective values of Nom (black) and of Rob (grey) in the nominal scenario. It can be seen that under the nominal scenario, the nominally efficient solutions are slightly better than the robust efficient solutions, in particular, the objective vectors of robust efficient solutions under the nominal scenario are each dominated by objective vectors of nominally efficient solutions under the nominal scenario.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we have shown how minmax robustness can be extended to multi-objective optimization problems. In particular, we provide definitions for a solution being robust for a multi-objective optimization problem and denote this as robust efficiency. We analyze the resulting concepts and sketch three methods for computing robust efficient solutions. Furthermore, we present some illustrations of robust efficient solutions and provide an example motivating the use of robust efficient solutions over nominally efficient ones.

Our work leaves many avenues for further research. First, a deeper analysis of the various algorithms for finding robust efficient solutions is necessary. The different algorithms provide valid tools for finding robust efficient solutions but none of our methods is able to find all of the efficient solutions and there also exist robust efficient solutions which are not found by any of the methods presented. A classification of the solutions found by the various methods might be helpful and is under investigation for special cases, in particular for uncertain linear programming with multiple objectives and for uncertain multi-objective location problems.

Furthermore, we are interested in other concepts of minmax robustness for multi-objective optimization problems. The concept we use depends crucially on how the worst case over all scenarios is defined, which in the case of multi-objective optimization needs the definition of a supremum of a set. In our definition of robust efficiency, we furthermore use a certain kind of set ordering, namely a definition of dominance of sets. Replacing either the definition of the worst case or the definition of the set dominance by other ones (e.g., using a different ordering of sets from set valued optimization) will yield new concepts of robustness for multi-objective optimization problems, see Ide, Köbis, Kuroiwa, Schöbel, and Tammer, 2014; Ide and Köbis, 2013 for first steps in this direction.

Another consideration is to not only look at minmax robustness but also to extend more recent robustness concepts such as light robustness, adjustable robustness, or recovery robustness to multi-objective optimization. For light robustness, this has been done in Ide and Schöbel (2013) and Kuhn et al. (2012) for a special bi-objective case.

Finally, we work on applications in agriculture, where uncertainty comes from the fact that properties of the harvested goods heavily depend on the weather and are not known before harvest. These properties are crucial for the quality of the resulting products and thus uncertain multi-objective optimization is of high interest in this field of application.
