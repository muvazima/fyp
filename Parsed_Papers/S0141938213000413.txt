                  In a plasma display panel (PDP), ramp pulse is used for the reset operation. In this case, the stability of ramp slope is very important because the variation of ramp slope leads to the reset failure. However, the ramp slope is affected by the image load and operation temperature. In this paper, the variation of ramp slope is analyzed and a new ramp driver circuit is proposed. In the proposed driver circuit, the effect of image load is compensated for by redesigning the current path of the feedback capacitor. The slope variation caused by temperature variation is reduced by compensating for the threshold voltage shift of a MOSFET. The proposed ramp driver circuit provides multiple ramp slopes by adjusting the control signal and guarantees the stability of ramp slope against the changes of image load and temperature. The variation of ramp slope in the proposed method is reduced by 82.7% compared with the previous switched ramp driver circuit. Moreover, the additional hardware cost of the proposed driver circuit is minimal.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In a flat panel display, the price as well as image quality is very important to enlarge the market share. To do this in a plasma display panel (PDP), many efforts have been made to reduce cost and improve productivity, which can be achieved by optimizing the panel and the driver circuit. In order to improve the production yield of PDPs, most of PDPs use a ramp reset which changes the voltage of an electrode linearly. Ramp reset compensates for the difference of firing voltage of each cell on a panel by controlling the wall voltage [1–3]. Slow ramp slope can compensate for the deviation of firing voltage on a panel more precisely, but the driving time for reset period increases by the slow ramp slope. Therefore, ramp drivers that can generate multiple ramp slopes were proposed [4–6]. When wall voltage has to be controlled precisely, slow ramp slope is used; otherwise, ramp slope is set to steep slope which does not cause strong discharge. Multiple ramp slopes are used for other reasons such as contrast and image representation [7,8].

Conventional ramp driver circuit consists of a MOSFET and its gate driver that includes a gate resistor and a capacitor (CDG
                     ). CDG
                      is connected to the gate and the drain of the MOSFET. This MOSFET is located between a voltage source, VF
                     , and the panel of which the voltage is increased or decreased to VF
                      linearly by the ramp driver. In this circuit, the voltage variation of a panel is the same as that of CDG
                     . Since constant gate current flows through CDG
                     , the voltage of CDG
                      changes linearly and thus the panel voltage changes linearly as well. The slope of this ramp pulse is determined by the gate resistance and CDG
                     . Since the gate resistance and CDG
                      cannot be adjusted during operation, the gate control signal is adjusted for generating multiple ramp slopes by using a single driver circuit. In this method, the MOSFET is turned on and off repeatedly many times for a ramp pulse of which the slope is determined by the period and duty ratios of the gate signal.

The ramp slope must be controlled accurately. When the ramp slope is slower than the target slope, the electrode voltage cannot reach the final reset voltage. When the ramp slope is steeper than the target value, the time interval between the end of ramp reset and the next pulse, such as the addressing pulse, increases and the driving voltage margin is reduced. Unfortunately, the ramp driver cannot maintain the target slope because it is affected by the temperature and the image load that is the number of turned-on pixels on a panel. The threshold voltage (VT
                     ) of the MOSFET in a ramp driver is affected by temperature, which results in the variation of ramp slope. Discharge current in a panel is affected by the image load. When the MOSFET of the ramp driver is turned off, the voltage of CDG
                      is changed by the remaining discharge current and thus the panel voltage is affected by the image load.

In some commercial PDPs, the control signal of a ramp driver is adjusted according to the temperature in order to maintain the target slope. However, this method cannot provide accurate ramp slope because the variation of ramp slope caused by the image load and temperature is different for each PDP set due to the characteristic deviation of electrical parts and panels.

In this paper, a new ramp driver circuit for stable ramp slope is proposed. In order to compensate for the effect of the image load, the current path of the CDG
                      is redesigned. The effect of threshold voltage shift by temperature is compensated for by adjusting the voltage of gate driver. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by simulations and experiments.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains previous ramp driver circuits and the variation of ramp slope in these methods. Section 3 presents the proposed ramp driver and Section 4 shows the experiment and simulation. Section 5 gives results and discussion and Section 6 concludes this paper.


                     Fig. 1
                      shows a driving waveform of Y electrode in a 42-in. PDP. In this figure, RRN and FRN denote the Nth rising reset pulse and falling reset pulse, respectively. In this figure, ramp slopes of FR1, RR1 and FR2 are very slow to control the wall voltage precisely. From FR3 and RR2, the ramp slope is steep for reducing reset period. These various slope can be generated by a single ramp driver circuit. There are many cost effective ramp driver circuits [9,10].


                     Fig. 2
                      shows a conventional ramp driver circuit for the falling ramp pulse. The panel is modeled as a capacitor, CP
                     , and the final voltage of falling ramp reset is denoted by VF
                     . The difference between the ramp driver in Fig. 2 and a general MOSFET driver is that the gate resistance of RON
                      is high and CDG
                      is added between gate and drain of the MOSFET. Thus, input gate current is low and M1 is turned on slowly. On the contrary, the resistance of ROFF
                      is so low that M1 is turned off fast. Let VCC
                      denote the voltage of control signal (VS
                     ) for turning on M1. When VS
                      is VCC
                     , the panel voltage decreases linearly and falling ramp pulse is generated as shown in Fig. 1. In the conventional ramp driver, the ramp slope can be adjusted by changing RON
                     , VCC
                      and CDG
                     . The adjustment of these factors during operation is not easy.

In order to obtain multiple ramp slopes from a single ramp driver circuit, the conventional ramp driver circuit in Fig. 2 is used but the control signal is modified. Fig. 3
                      shows the modified control signal for generating multiple ramp slopes. When gate signal becomes VCC
                     , M1 is turned on and VP
                      decreases by ΔVON
                     . When gate signal becomes 0V, M1 is turned off. If the period of one switching cycle is TPRD
                     , the ramp slope is ΔVON
                     /TPRD
                      in this method. Therefore, the slope can be controlled by the period TPRD
                      and ΔVON
                     . In this paper, the method shown in Fig. 3 is referred to as a switched ramp driver.

The ramp pulse reset has to control the wall charge precisely because wall voltage setup by the ramp reset determines the performance of address operation. Therefore, accurate ramp slope is very important. However, the ramp slope is affected by the image load and temperature. In the following subsections, the analysis of the ramp slope variation in the conventional ramp driver and the switched ramp driver is presented.

The voltage variation and the current flow of the conventional ramp driver are shown in Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                        . VGS
                        , VDG
                         and VP
                         that is the panel voltage are presented in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 represents the current flow of the conventional ramp driver.


                        Initial phase: VGS
                         are 0V and VP
                         is assumed to be VP
                        
                        0. Thus, VDG
                         is VP
                        
                        0

                         becomes VCC
                        , and thus, gate current flows as shown in Fig. 5a. The gate current (IG
                        ) is given by the following equation:

                         and VGS
                         change as shown in Fig. 4.

                        period: When VGS
                         reaches VT
                         that is the threshold voltage of M1, M1 is turned on and current flows from CP
                         through M1 to VF
                         voltage source. This current is represented by dotted line in Fig. 5b. Since current flows from CP
                        , VP
                         decreases, and thus, the voltage difference between drain and source of M1 decrease as well. Therefore, VDG
                         decreases as much as VP
                         variation. In T
                        1, all gate current flows to CDG
                         in order to change VDG
                         in accordance with VP
                         variation. Consider the change rate of VDG
                        . Let ΔQDG
                         denote the variation of charge of CDG
                         for Δt. Assuming that VGS

                         and CGS
                         until VGS

Eq. (3) shows that the ramp slope is a function of VT
                        . Recall that VT
                         of a MOSFET varies with temperature. Therefore, ramp slope in (3) is changed by the temperature variation.

As shown in Fig. 1, the multiple ramp slopes are needed for reducing reset period and maintaining the reset performance. In order to generate multiple ramp slopes, the control signal in Fig. 3 is used in the switched ramp driver in which the driver circuit is the same as that in Fig. 2. The output waveform of this method is shown in Fig. 3 in which the voltage variation during TON
                         can be obtained by multiplying TON
                         and slopeconv
                         in (3). Therefore, the slope of a switched ramp driver is given by the following equation:

                        The slope of a switched ramp driver can be controlled by adjusting TON
                         and/or TPRD
                         which can be changed easily during operation. Therefore, a switched ramp driver can generate multiple ramp slopes without additional hardware cost. However, the ramp slope is changed depending on the image load and temperature, which results in the failure in reset operation.


                        Image load effect: In order to obtain a stable ramp slope, VP
                         and VDG
                         should not be changed during TOFF
                         as shown in Fig. 3. However, VP
                         and VDG
                         can be changed during TOFF
                        . Although M1 is turned off and a ramp driver does not change VP
                         during TOFF
                        , the remaining discharge current that flows between electrodes on a panel can cause VP
                         to change. Since the electrodes are floated in TOFF
                        , the voltage of a panel is raised by the remaining discharge current that is proportional to the number of cells which are turned on in the previous sub-field. Therefore, the voltage variation during TOFF
                         is affected by the image load. As the image load increases, VP
                         is raised higher during TOFF
                        . Note that VDG
                         is raised as much as VP
                        . In this paper, the increased voltage during TOFF
                         is denoted by ΔVOFF
                        . The voltage variation in a switching cycle is (ΔVON
                        
                        −ΔVOFF
                        ) and the ramp slope of the switched ramp driver is given by the following equation:

                        In (5), ΔVON
                         and TPRD
                         can be controlled but ΔVOFF
                         is not controllable because it is determined by the input image. The variation of ramp slope caused by the image load may lead to the failure of reset operation.


                        Temperature effect: Threshold voltage, VT
                        , of a MOSFET is changed depending on the temperature. In a conventional ramp driver, the ramp slope is varied with the temperature because the slope in (3) is affected by VT
                        . In the switched ramp driver, VT
                         and TON
                         in (4) are changed by temperature variation. Assuming that the rising slope of VGS
                         does not vary with temperature in Fig. 3, TON
                         decreases as VT
                         increases. Therefore, the ramp slope variation in the switched ramp driver is more serious than in the conventional ramp driver.


                     Fig. 6
                      shows the proposed ramp driver circuit in which the ramp slope variation caused by the image load and temperature is reduced. The control signal of the proposed driver circuit is the same as that in Fig. 3 and the slope can be controlled by adjusting TON
                      and TPRD
                     . The proposed ramp driver in Fig. 6 is different from the conventional ramp driver in blocks A and B. Block A is added to compensate for the effect of the image load and block B to compensate for the effect of temperature.

The reason of image load effect is that VP
                         and VDG
                         are changed by the remaining discharge current during TOFF
                        . In the proposed method, VP
                         changes during TOFF
                         but VDG
                         does not change, which can be achieved by adding a zener diode between CDG
                         and drain of M1. For simplicity, Fig. 7
                         shows an equivalent circuit to the proposed ramp driver during TOFF
                         to explain the compensation for image load effect. In Fig. 7, block B in Fig. 6 is removed.

During TOFF
                        , remaining discharge current flows through CP
                         but it cannot flow through CDG
                         because of ZD. Thus, the effective voltage variation of VP
                         for a switching cycle is reduced to (ΔVON
                        
                        −ΔVOFF
                        ) but that of VDG
                         maintains ΔVON
                        . At the beginning of TON
                        , (VDG
                        
                        +
                        VGS
                        
                        +
                        VF
                        ) is higher than VP
                        . Since VP
                         tends to be the same as (VDG
                        
                        +
                        VGS

                        VF
                        ), VP
                         decreases more than ΔVDG
                         by ΔVOFF
                        , and thus, the voltage drop of VP
                         is (ΔVON
                        
                        +ΔVOFF
                        ) during TON
                        . Since VP
                         increases ΔVOFF
                         in TOFF
                        , the effective voltage variation during a TPRD

                        It means that the term of ΔVOFF
                         in (5) is eliminated and the image load effect is compensated for by ZD.

In order to reduce the ramp slope variation caused by the temperature, (VCC
                        
                        −
                        VT
                        ) and TON
                         in (3) and (4) should not be changed by temperature. In the proposed method, VT
                         term in the numerator of (3) and (4) is removed and the variation of TON
                         is reduced by adjusting the gate driving voltage. Fig. 8
                         shows the equivalent ramp driver circuit to the proposed ramp driver in Fig. 6. In Fig. 8, MCOMP
                         in Fig. 6 is replaced with an equivalent circuit to explain the compensation for the temperature effect.

The basic concept for compensating for the effect of VT
                         variation is that VT
                         value is measured and stored in CCOMP
                         in Fig. 8. If the voltage of CCOMP
                         (VCOMP
                        ) maintains just below VT
                        , the gate driving voltage is (VCC
                        
                        +
                        VT
                        ) for turning on M1. In this case, VCC
                         term in (3) and (4) is replaced with (VCC
                        
                        +
                        VT
                        ) and thus the numerator of (3) and (4) becomes (VCC
                        
                        +
                        VT
                        
                        −
                        VT
                        )=
                        VCC
                        . Therefore, the ramp slope is not affected by VT
                        . If the VCOMP
                         is just below VT
                        , VGS
                         is set to the value of just below VT
                         during TOFF
                        . In this case, the difference of VGS
                         between TOFF
                         and TON
                         is very small, which results in the stable ramp slope against temperature variation. Recall that the effective TON
                         in (4) varies depending on the voltage difference between the VGS
                         of TOFF
                         and VT
                         as shown in Fig. 3. The followings explain the way of storing VT
                         in CCOMP
                        .

In the initial state of falling ramp reset, VP
                         is higher than VF
                        . VGS
                         and VCOMP
                         are 0V. In this circuit, (VF
                        
                        +5V) is supplied to a terminal of RDD
                         in Fig. 8. When the VS
                         becomes VCC
                        , VGS
                         becomes VT
                         and VP
                         decreases linearly. Since VGS
                         is VT
                         and VCOMP
                         is 0V, Q
                        1 and Q
                        2 are turned on. Then, current flows from the voltage source of (VF
                        
                        +5V) to CCOMP
                         and VCOMP
                         increases. When VCOMP
                         becomes (VT
                        
                        −
                        VBE
                        ), Q
                        1 is turned off because the base current of Q
                        1 does not flow from the gate of M1. Once VCOMP
                         reaches (VT
                        
                        −
                        VBE
                        ) in the beginning stage of falling ramp reset, VCOMP
                         maintains (VT
                        
                        −
                        VBE
                        ) during the falling ramp period.

When VS
                         is 0V, VGS
                         becomes (VT
                        
                        −
                        VBE
                        ) and M1 is turned off. In this case, TON
                         variation shown in Fig. 3 can be negligible because the voltage difference between the VGS
                         during TOFF
                         and VT
                         is always VBE
                         regardless of VT
                         value. Therefore, TON
                         in (4) is not changed by VT
                         variation. When VS
                         becomes VCC
                        , the gate driving voltage becomes (VCC
                        
                        +
                        VT
                        
                        −
                        VBE
                        ). Therefore, the VCC
                         in (3) and (4) is replaced with VCC
                        
                        +
                        VT
                        
                        −
                        VBE

                        In (8), the variation of VBE
                         caused by temperature is much smaller than that of VT
                         in a MOSFET. Therefore, the ramp slope variation can be reduced by the proposed method.

When falling ramp reset is completed, VGS
                         should be set to 0V for turning off M1. In the proposed ramp driver in Fig. 6, MCOMP
                         is added for turning off M1. The CCOMP
                         and D1 in Fig. 8 can be replaced with the parasitic capacitance and body-diode of the MCOMP
                         in Fig. 6. When MCOMP
                         is turned off, the proposed circuit can generate a ramp pulse. When MCOMP
                         is turned on and VS
                         is 0V, VGS
                         of the M1 is set to 0V and M1 is turned off. The maximum drain-source voltage of MCOMP
                         is 5V so additional cost for MCOMP
                         is small. The maximum voltage of transistors Q
                        1 and Q
                        2 is VCC
                        . The voltage source of VF
                        
                        +5V is implemented in almost commercial PDPs for the scan driver IC. Thus, additional hardware cost is minimal.

The stability of ramp slope of the proposed method in Fig. 6 is evaluated by simulations and experiments. The compensation for the image load effect is evaluated by simulations for the switched ramp driver and the proposed ramp driver. Remaining discharge current in the ramp reset operation is modeled as a current source IP
                      as shown in Fig. 9
                     . In this simulation, IP
                      is set to 150mA during TOFF
                      for the case when the image load is high. When the image load is low, IP
                      is set to 0A. In this simulation, panel is modeled as 100nF capacitor and panel voltage decreases from 200V to −170V linearly by the ramp driver.

The compensation for the temperature effect is evaluated by simulations and experiments. The temperature effect on the ramp slope is simulated for the conventional ramp driver, the switched ramp driver and the proposed ramp driver. In these simulations, a 100nF capacitor is used for a panel. This capacitor load is different from a panel in that there is no discharge current. However, the panel voltage variation in (2) and (7) during TON
                      is not affected by the discharge current, but by the gate current and the feedback capacitor, CDG
                     . The discharge current effect on the panel voltage during TOFF
                      is eliminated by the compensation method for the image load effect. Therefore, the results with the 100nF capacitor are the same as those with a panel. In this simulation, panel voltage decreases from 200V to −170V. The temperatures in the simulation are −55°C and 125°C and VT
                      of a MOSFET is set to 3.657V and 2.4V, respectively, according to the datasheet of the MOSFET used for this experiment.

In the experiment for evaluating compensation for temperature effect, each ramp driver circuit is implemented and the slope variation caused by the temperature is measured at −55°C and room temperature. In these experiments, a 100nF capacitor is used for a panel of which the voltage varies from 400V to 0V by the ramp driver.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The simulation results of the ramp slope variation caused by the image load are shown in Figs. 10 and 11
                     
                     . Fig. 10a shows the ramp slope variation when the switched ramp driver is used. In this figure, the dotted line represents the ramp pulse with low image load and the solid line represents that with high image load. In this figure, the slope is changed according to the image load and the deviation of reset period is 12.1μs. Fig. 10b shows the voltage variation for each switching cycle. When the load is low, ΔVOFF
                      is 0V and ΔVON
                      is 3.20V. When the load is high, ΔVOFF
                      is 0.41V and ΔVON
                      is 3.28V. Thus, effective voltage variation is 2.87V for a switching cycle, which means that the ramp slope is changed by the image load. Fig. 11a shows the ramp pulses of high and low image loads when the proposed ramp driver in Fig. 6 is used. In this case, the reset period difference between the cases of high and low image load is 1usec that is a period of a single ramp cycle. In Fig. 11b, ΔVOFF
                      is 0V and ΔVON
                      is 3.23V when the load is low. When image load is high, ΔVOFF
                      is 0.50V and ΔVON
                      is 3.70V. In this method, ΔVON
                      increases as much as ΔVOFF
                     , and thus, the effective voltage variation, (ΔVON
                     
                     −ΔVOFF
                     ), is 3.2V. In the proposed method, the average ΔVON
                     s of low and high image load are 3.224V and 3.202V, respectively, which are averaged ΔVON
                      for 5 data points. The ΔVON
                      difference between the cases of high and low image load is (3.224V−3.202V=0.022V). Since the number of ramp cycles is about 114 in the falling ramp reset, the voltage difference at the end of falling ramp is about (0.022×114=2.508V) which makes 1μs difference in the falling ramp period. Recall that ΔVON
                      is 3.2V for a single ramp cycle of which the period is 1μs. Fig. 11 shows that the ramp slope variation caused by image load can be reduced by the proposed method.

The simulation results of temperature effect on the conventional ramp driver, the switched ramp driver and the proposed ramp driver are shown in Figs. 12 and 13
                     
                     . Fig. 12a and b show the gate voltage, VGS
                     , in the switched ramp driver for the cases of VT
                     
                     =3.657V and VT
                     
                     =2.4V. Fig. 12 shows that TON
                      is a function of VT
                     . Fig. 13 shows the variation of ramp slope for each case. In Fig. 13a and b, the variations of reset period in the conventional ramp driver and the switched ramp driver are 12.3μs and 54.2μs, respectively. Fig. 13c shows that the variation of reset period is 7.1μs in the proposed ramp driver. Table 1
                      shows the deviation of ramp reset period depending on the temperature in simulation. The first column in Table 1 represents the period of falling ramp pulse at 125°C. The second to the fourth columns show the variation of reset period between −55°C and 125°C conditions of the conventional ramp driver, the switched ramp driver and the proposed ramp driver, respectively. The deviation of the switched ramp is larger than those of the conventional ramp and the proposed ramp method. Let the variation ratio denote the ratio of reset period variation to the falling reset period of 125°C. The average variation ratio of the switched ramp is 43.4% and that of the conventional ramp is 10.5% while that of the proposed method is 6.5%.

The experimental results of temperature effect on the ramp slope in the conventional ramp driver, the switched ramp driver and the proposed ramp driver are shown in Fig. 14
                     . In the conventional ramp driver, the falling ramp period changes from 110μs to 134μs with the temperature range from room temperature to −55°C, which means that the maximum variation of falling reset period is 21.8%. In the switched ramp driver, the maximum variation is 154.5% under the same condition. Fig. 14c shows the falling ramp pulse of the proposed ramp driver at room temperature and −55°C. In the proposed method, the falling ramp reset period ranges from 110μs to 123μs. The maximum variation of reset period is 11.8%. Table 2
                      shows the falling ramp reset period and ramp slope of the conventional ramp driver, the switched ramp driver and the proposed method depending on the temperature. The variation of ramp slope in the proposed method is improved by 41.7% and 82.7% compared with the conventional ramp driver and the switched ramp driver, respectively.

The switched ramp driver can generate multiple ramp slopes but ramp slope is changed by the image load and temperature more seriously compared with the conventional ramp driver. The ramp slope of the conventional ramp driver is more stable than that of the switched ramp driver but it can generate only a single ramp slope. The proposed ramp driver can generate multiple ramp slopes while the slope variation caused by the temperature and image load is reduced dramatically compared with the switched ramp driver. Since the ramp slope variation can be reduced by the proposed method, ramp reset performance can be improved and the driving time can be reduced.

The switched ramp is evaluated by simulation and experiment. The variation of ramp slope in experiment is much larger than that in simulation. This difference is caused by the difference of gate resistor, RON
                     , in Fig. 6. In the simulation, gate resistance was 500Ω while gate resistance was 2kΩ in the experiment. As the gate resistance increases, the rising slope of gate pulse (VGS
                     ) in Fig. 3 becomes slower. Therefore, the variation of TON
                      due to VT
                      variation increases when the gate resistance increases. Since the gate resistance in the experiment is larger than that in the simulation, slope variation in the experiment is larger than that in the simulation. It means that low gate resistance is better for reducing ramp slope variation.

As shown in Fig. 6, the proposed ramp driver requires additional switches-MCOMP
                     , Q
                     1 and Q
                     2. Thus, hardware cost increases, but additional cost is not large because the voltage and current load of these switches are very low. When the proposed ramp driver is used, gate voltage of ramp driver increases to (VCC
                     
                     +
                     VT
                     ) which may exceeds the maximum voltage rating of VGS
                      of a MOSFET. Although ZDG
                      in Fig. 6 is added, more attention should be paid to design VCC
                      in the proposed method. In this paper, the ramp driver circuit for the falling ramp reset is explained, but the rising ramp driver can be designed easily by modifying the proposed driver circuit.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper proposed a new ramp driver circuit which is used for a reset operation in a PDP. The variation of the ramp slope was analyzed and the method for reducing the slope variation caused by the image load and temperature was proposed. The stability of ramp slope is improved by the proposed method compared with the conventional ramp driver and switched ramp driver. The additional cost of the proposed method is very small compared with its performance improvement.
