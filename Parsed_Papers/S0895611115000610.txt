                  The main aim of this research is finding the feature vectors of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL and PCL). These feature vectors have to clearly define the ligaments structure and make it easier to diagnose them. Extraction of feature vectors is obtained by analysis of both anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments. This procedure is performed after the extraction process of both ligaments. In the first stage in order to reduce the area of analysis a region of interest including cruciate ligaments (CL) is outlined in order to reduce the area of analysis. In this case, the fuzzy C-means algorithm with median modification helping to reduce blurred edges has been implemented. After finding the region of interest (ROI), the fuzzy connectedness procedure is performed. This procedure permits to extract the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament structures. In the last stage, on the basis of the extracted anterior and posterior cruciate ligament structures, 3-dimensional models of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament are built and the feature vectors created. This methodology has been implemented in MATLAB and tested on clinical T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slices of the knee joint. The 3D display is based on the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) and Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) are anatomical structures responsible, together with the collateral ligaments, for the knee stability and ensure proper arthrokinematics, along with the shape of articular surface, muscles and contact forces. They also play an important role during passive and active motions of the knee joint. During a passive motion of the knee, the cruciate ligaments help to change rolling into sliding movements and during an active motion of the knee they resist translations and reduce shear forces. For that reason the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments belong to the group of anatomical structures frequently susceptible to injuries, especially in athletes [1–3].

Nowadays, it is estimated that the annual incidence of cruciate ligaments injury is about 1 in 3000 amongst the general population in the USA [4]. For that reason the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery is a major area of research in the whole world. The analysis of medical literature shows how much has been written regarding general treatment and various surgical procedures of the destabilized knee. These papers discuss in the first instance the reconstruction of the cruciate ligament [5–7] and the rehabilitation after such cruciate ligament reconstruction [8–11]. And although the first surgical reconstruction of the cruciate ligament was executed about one hundred years ago (Mayo Robson, General Infirmary in Leeds, 1895), the dispute over the appropriate treatment method of the instability of the knee joint has continued to end up in a general disagreement [4,12]. The success of ligaments reconstructive procedure depends on many factors. For accurate recognition and proper diagnosis usually MRI slices are used [13,14]. In orthopedists’ opinion each additional element supporting the diagnosis is very important, but there are multiple factors that may contribute to the incorrect diagnostics of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments. And the three-dimensional structures of reconstructed cruciate ligaments together with the construction of a vector containing the appropriate set of features are especially desired because they can still improve the diagnosis.

The knee joint T1-weighted MRI slices with pathological anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments feature blurred geometrical shapes and difficulty to precisely describe the knee joint anatomy. The presented method of enhancing the idea of fuzzy images, creating and using the entropy measure of fuzziness to the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments location in the T1-weighted MRI slices of the knee joint and the fuzzy connectedness idea to the segmentation of these structures, seems to be very effective and promising [15–19]. Fuzzy logic applied to the cruciate ligaments location allows a comprehensive knee joint computer aided diagnosis tool to be developed. The classical methods are useful in the case of artificial image analysis, but unfortunately do not give correct results in biomedical use. The biomedical images feature large complexity that requires taking into consideration many elements which influence each other. Two important problems are faced: the first concerns inaccuracy (lack of possibility of precise description of the segmented structures) and the second concerns data uncertainty (identical results are difficult to obtain especially for the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint).

Magnetic resonance imaging is today the primary method for the diagnostics of the knee joint cruciate ligaments lesions. Conventional radiography is an irreplaceable method in evaluation of bone injuries. In case of soft tissue injuries, especially intra knee joint structures, MRI is the method of choice. Therefore in this paper, the computer analysis of cruciate ligaments is shown on the example of MRI of the knee joint (Figs. 2 and 3
                     
                     ).

@&#METHODS@&#

The block diagram of the presented methodology providing the major outline of the overall algorithm is given in Fig. 1
                        .

In this paper the methodology of finding a 2-dimensional region of interest including the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (based on entropy measure of fuzziness and fuzzy c-means algorithm with median modification) and the extraction process of the cruciate ligaments structure from T1-weighted MRI series (based on fuzzy connectednes) are not described in detail. An exhaustive description thereof can be found in [15,19].

Generally the entropy measure of fuzziness is a mapping from the set of all fuzzy subsets of a base set X into the nonnegative real numbers. It may be expressed as highlighting the parts of the image with a significant difference in the intensity of the neighbouring pixels. Implementation of the entropy measure of fuzziness according to the block diagram (Fig. 1) also allows to determine the limitation of slices including the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments structures in the MRI series.

The most important weaknesses of the standard fuzzy c-means algorithm: it does not incorporate spatial context information which makes it sensitive to noise and image artefacts. For this reason a modified method of the fuzzy c-means algorithm is used in this paper. This modified method is based on the modification of the objective function by introducing a second term which formulates a spatial constraint based on the median estimator. The objective function of the fuzzy c-means can be also changed by introducing an element which depends on the mean value of neighbour pixels. The most important weaknesses of this modification: it propagates features of a mean filtered image into the clustering results, and blurred edges are one of the most important disadvantages of the method. Therefore in order to reduce the drawback, the median estimator has been added to the objective function.

Depending on the slice thickness, the anterior cruciate ligament structure may be present in 2–4 slices in a sagittal series and the posterior cruciate ligament structure may be present in 4–6 slices in a sagittal series. The selected slices are subjected to further analysis that yields the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament structures.

The segmentation process of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament structures based on a fuzzy connectedness concept is described briefly in Section 2.3 and the results are presented in Section 3.

In this study the Live-Wire approach with fuzzy C-means clustering has been used as a reference method in the segmentation process. An exhaustive description of this approach can be found in [20].

This article discusses the selection of the feature vector and its impact on the diagnostics of the cruciate ligaments lesions. This selection has been made in consultation with experts (orthopedists and radiologists), since their role in this process is very important and irreplaceable [21]. It is impossible to build a properly functioning computer aided diagnosis system without experts consultations.

Preliminary results of a pilot study on application of the feature vector into analysis and diagnostics of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments [22,23] received positive opinions from the reviewers encouraging the author of this paper to present a broader description of this methodology.

In order to lower the computational complexity and to increase the efficiency an automatic procedure of extracting the 2-dimensional region of interest (2D ROI) that includes the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments structures has been implemented. This procedure is based on the analysis of the T1-weighted MRI slices in a sagittal series (the resolution of the T1-weighted MRI slices of the knee joint is usually 256×256 pixels) and the processed area has been reduced three times on the average (the average length of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament 2-dimensional region of interest is about 100×100 pixels). The 3-dimensional region of interest (3D ROI) including the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments of the knee joint is obtained by mapping the 2D ROI on all of the T1-weighted MRI slices of the knee joint. The 3D ROI is presented in Figs. 2 and 3.

This study implements the procedure of location of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament on the T1-weighted MRI slices of the knee joint based on the entropy and energy measures of fuzziness and Fuzzy C-Means algorithm with median modification. This procedure has been described in detail in [15,19]. Generally the entropy measure of fuzziness is a mapping from the set of all fuzzy subsets of a base set into the nonnegative real numbers. It may be expressed as highlighting the parts of the image with a significant difference in the intensity of the neighbouring pixels. The implementation of the entropy measure of fuzziness according to the block diagram (Fig. 1) also allows to determine the limitation of slices including the posterior cruciate ligament structures in the MRI series.

Further analysis related to the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament structures segmentation is based on the fuzzy connectedness method. In the literature a generalized definition of fuzzy connectedness can be found [24]. The generalized definition of fuzzy connectedness is based on the fuzzy affinity relation and introduces an iterative method permitting fuzzy connectedness to be determined with respect to a chosen image pixel – seed point. In order to increase the efficiency of computational procedures the fuzzy connectedness method has been limited to 3-dimensional region of interest (as discussed in Section 2.2). This paper includes a brief outline of the fuzzy connectedness approach. An exhaustive description thereof can be found in [19,25].

Generally the fuzzy connectedness can be defined as a fuzzy relation

To evaluate the fuzzy connectedness for a given image with respect to the selected seed point, all possible paths connecting the seed point with each and every image pixel have to be analyzed. The implementation of a 5×5 (instead of typically used 3×3) neighborhood window within the region, containing a single cruciate ligament (anterior or posterior) with the surrounding tissue, permits the most typical cases of under-segmentation to be eliminated without much impact on the overall analysis time.

All the stages in the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament segmentation and extraction process based on the fuzzy connectedness approach, are shown in Fig. 4
                         or Fig. 5
                        . In the first step of that process the fuzzy connectedness is determined with respect to the chosen image pixel – the seed point (the point marked in Figs. 4a and 5a). Said point has to belong to the extracted anatomical structure – anterior or posterior cruciate ligament. In the next step morphological operations are implemented. The morphological operations break the narrow links between the ligament and the undesired structures. The latter are then removed and usually the correct result is found (Fig. 4b or Fig. 5b). The result is superimposed on the original image (Fig. 4c or Fig. 5c).

At this point of the analysis a spatial 3-dimensional anterior and posterior cruciate ligament structure (linear interpolation may be used in order to fill in the gaps between slices and equal the voxel size in all directions) can be built or a skeleton of anterior and posterior cruciate ligament found (Fig. 4d or Fig. 5d).

An appropriate design of the feature vector is a very important part of any computer-aided diagnosis system. In the case of lesion diagnostics of the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint it is a particularly important process. On the basis of segmented structures of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament two main elements of the feature vector were determined: the surface area (Fig. 6
                        b) and the skeleton of the cruciate ligaments (Fig. 6c) respectively. In order to find the surface area all pixels belonging to the segmented anterior and posterior cruciate ligament structures have to be calculated. As mentioned earlier, depending on the slice thickness, the anterior cruciate ligament structure may be present in 2–4 slices in a sagittal series and the posterior cruciate ligament structure may be present in 4–6 slices in a sagittal series. Therefore, it is necessary to make the calculations for each of the slices containing extracted ligament structures.

In this paper the following features of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments have been calculated:
                           
                              •
                              surface area and perimeter of the extracted structure (anterior and posterior cruciate ligament),

the ratio of the extracted ligament area to the region of interest area,

the maximum distance between a straight line combining the start and end point (A-length Fig. 6d) of the skeleton and its top and bottom edges (B-length Fig. 6d),

B-length/A-length ratio (modified Feret ratio – the ratio of maximum diameter of the object in horizontal to the maximum diameter of the object in vertical).

This selection of the features above has been made in consultation with experts (orthopedists and radiologists). In their opinion the only surface area and the only perimeter of the extracted structure depend strongly on the size of the patient (for big patient surface area of the healthy ligament structure can be greater than the surface area of the pathological structure of the small patient).

During the diagnostic analysis each slice containing the largest area of the extracted ligament was chosen and then the ratio of the ligament area (Fig. 6b) to the region of interest area (Fig. 6a) was calculated. It is worth noting that the region of interest is dependent on the anatomy of the knee joint of the patient.

The skeleton of the cruciate ligaments permits to determine the maximum distance between a straight line combining the start and end point (A-length Fig. 6d) of the skeleton and its top and bottom edges (B-length Fig. 6d) – edge of the skeleton. This maximum distance is then used to calculate the ratio of B/A length and is useful in the diagnostics of cruciate ligaments lesions, especially for the posterior cruciate ligament (Fig. 10
                        ).

@&#RESULTS@&#

The research has been tested on 74 clinical T1-weighted MRI studies of the knee joint. This group consists of 27 healthy (e.g. Fig. 4) and 47 pathological (e.g. Fig. 4) cases of the anterior cruciate ligaments and 45 healthy (e.g. Fig. 5) and 29 pathological (e.g. Fig. 5) cases of the posterior cruciate ligaments.

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

On the basis of testing studies the following elements can be proven. By comparing the original T1-weighted MRI slices of the knee joint with the segmented anterior cruciate ligament structures, the expert radiologists stated that in 66 (89%) cases the proposed anterior cruciate ligament segmentation and extraction method yielded correct results (e.g. Fig. 4c). The evaluation has been performed by two radiologists and in 65 studies (88%) the anterior and cruciate ligament segmentation has passed the test. Quite similar results have been obtained for the posterior cruciate ligament structures. The radiologists stated that in 66 (89%) cases the proposed posterior cruciate ligament segmentation and extraction method yielded correct results (e.g. Fig. 5c).

Incorrect locations have been caused by the following factors: ligament displaced as a result of a broken thighbone (2 cases), lack of alignment of the thighbone and tibia along the same axis (5 cases) and location of the knee joint in the outermost part of the slice (1 case).

The breaking of thighbone structures in the vicinity of the knee joint excludes the possibility of using the proposed algorithm for finding the 2-dimensional region of interest that includes the cruciate ligament. This kind of pathology is not a common case. Its diagnosis is not a difficult problem for radiologists and does not require from them a time-consuming analysis of the T1-weighted MRI slices of the knee joint.

The presented methodology does not yield correct results in case of lack of thighbone and tibia aligned along the same axis. The envelope of the family of selected profiles described at length in [15], allows for a deviation of up to twenty degrees between both bones. The deviation of more than twenty degrees was found in patients with degeneration in the knee joint and such deviation caused incorrect location of the 2-dimensional region of interest.

Nowadays ligamentous injuries of the knee joint have become a growing problem having both social and medical aspects. Injuries of the cruciate ligaments are diagnosed on the basis of MRI studies. However, each medical study may be misinterpreted. In orthopedists and radiologists’ opinion, the most important criteria in the cruciate ligaments diagnostics are the surface area and the shape of cruciate ligament structures. Therefore the feature vector has to include the surface area (the ratio of the ligament area to the region of interest area) and the skeleton (B-length/A-length ratio) of the extracted structures of the cruciate ligaments (Figs. 7
                         and 10).


                        Tables 1
                         and 2
                         show the results obtained for the first 10 (3 healthy and 7 pathological) of the 74 anterior cruciate ligament cases. The selected results for both healthy and pathological cases of the anterior cruciate ligament are presented in graphical form in Fig. 7.

A comparison of the surface area of healthy and pathological structures of the cruciate ligaments (for corresponding slices - the largest area of the extracted anterior cruciate ligament in each case) on the basis of 74 clinical T1-weighted MRI studies of the knee joint, gives the following results. The ratio of the ligament area to the region of interest area is greater than 0.06 (6%) for injured anterior cruciate ligaments, and lower than 0.05 (5%) for healthy anterior cruciate ligaments (Tables 1 and 2). This is the first criterion for assessing anterior cruciate ligament pathology. In orthopedists and radiologists’ opinion, especially in case of doubt, it may be important and helpful to analyse the B-length/A-length ratio. The B-length/A-length ratio is greater than 0.3 for injured anterior cruciate ligaments, and lower than 0.3 for healthy anterior cruciate ligaments (Tables 1 and 2).


                        Fig. 8
                         presents the B-length/A-length ratio for all 74 anterior cruciate ligament studies. In this group there are the healthy cases as follows: 1, 4–5, 17, 19, 20, 25–26, 29, 35–36, 38, 41, 46, 48, 50, 52, 56, 58–60, 63–64, 68, 71, 73–74. The remaining cases belong to the group of pathological anterior cruciate ligament. For each study the maximum and minimum value of the B-length/A-length ratio has been shown for all slices which include the extracted anterior cruciate ligament structures. In Fig. 8 the B-length/A-length ratio corresponding to the largest area of the extracted anterior cruciate ligament structure has been marked for each study.

In order to present the quantification of results the B-length/A-length ratio obtained on the basis of the selection made by the expert and the B-length/A-length ratio calculated on the basis of the skeleton have been compared (Fig. 9
                        ). The beginning and end of the B- and A-length have been marked by the expert on the original T1-weighted MRI knee images. Fig. 9 presents the results (B-length/A-length ratio) for all 74 anterior cruciate ligament studies. The results are coincident and allow for the indication of healthy and pathological structures of the anterior cruciate ligaments. The differences in the values of the B-length/A-length ratio are due to the lack of possibility of precise description of the segmented structures and, especially, to the uncertainty analyzed data. The healthy structures are those for which the value of B-length/A-length ratio is lower than 0.3. This group includes 27 cases. The remaining 47 cases belong to the group of pathological anterior cruciate ligaments.

Quite similar steps are taken in order to analyse the posterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint. The results obtained for the first 10 (5 healthy and 5 pathological) of the 74 posterior cruciate ligament cases are shown in Tables 3
                         and 4
                        , and the graphical form of the selected results for both healthy and pathological cases of the posterior cruciate ligament are presented in Fig. 10.

The first criterion in the posterior cruciate ligament pathology is an assessment of the shape of the ligament (especially swelling ligament). In orthopedists and radiologists’ opinion the skeleton of the extracted posterior cruciate ligament structures is a good tool to evaluate the shape of the ligament. Having this in view the B-length/A-length ratio was calculated. A comparison of this ratio for healthy and pathological structures of the cruciate ligaments (for corresponding slices - the largest area of the extracted posterior cruciate ligament in each case) on the basis of 74 clinical T1-weighted MRI studies of the knee joint, gives the following results. The B-length/A-length ratio is greater than 0.4 for injured posterior cruciate ligaments, and lower than 0.4 for healthy posterior cruciate ligaments (Tables 3 and 4).


                        Fig. 11
                         presents the B-length/A-length ratio for all 74 posterior cruciate ligament studies. In this group the pathological cases are as follows: 6–11, 13–15, 17, 19–21, 24–25, 29, 31, 33–34, 37, 40–41, 46, 51, 55, 63, 66, 70–71. The remaining cases belong to the group of healthy posterior cruciate ligament. For each study the maximum and minimum value of the B-length/A-length ratio has been shown for all slices which include the extracted posterior cruciate ligament structures. In Fig. 11 the B-length/A-length ratio corresponding to the largest area of the extracted PCL structure has been marked for each study.

Quite similar steps are taken in order to present the quantification of results the posterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint. The B-length/A-length ratio obtained on the basis of the selection made by the expert and the B-length/A-length ratio calculated on the basis of the skeleton have been compared (Fig. 12
                        ). Also in this case the beginning and end of the B- and A-length have been marked by the expert on the original T1-weighted MRI knee images. In Fig. 12 have been presented the results (B-length/A-length ratio) for all 74 posterior cruciate ligament studies. The results for these anatomical structures are also coincident and allow for the indication of healthy and pathological structures of the posterior cruciate ligaments. Also in this case the identical values of the B-length/A-length ratio are difficult to obtain for reason of the data uncertainty and the lack of possibility of precise description of the segmented structures. The healthy structures are those for which the value of B-length/A-length ratio is lower than 0.4. This group includes 45 cases. The remaining 29 cases belong to the group of pathological posterior cruciate ligaments.

In present times the injuries of the anterior cruciate ligaments of the knee joint are much more frequent than the injuries of the posterior cruciate ligaments. In medical experts’ point of view, the diagnosis of the injuries is based upon several criteria dependent on the type of injury and the time elapsed from the moment of ligament injury. The basic criteria used in the diagnosis of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries are the following: increased intensity of the ligament signal in the entire volume in all sagittal slices, the surface area and ligament swelling. Frequently, the S-shape of the ligament is an additional criterion of the posterior cruciate ligament injury. Therefore, the skeleton of the segmented posterior cruciate ligament structure is another important feature.

In the opinion of two experts, a radiologist and an orthopaedist, the “shaving brush” type rupture of ligament is the most common injury of the anterior cruciate ligament, and also of the posterior cruciate ligament. In the MRI study it is characterized by massive swelling and fraying ligament fibers over their entire length.

Additionally, a partial damage in case of the posterior cruciate ligament is characterized by an irregular signal of the ligaments in the MRI study, swelling and disruption of the cruciate ligament structures [14].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The automatic method of location of the cruciate ligament on the T1-weighted MRI knee images, the segmentation and extraction procedures based on the fuzzy connectedness approach seem, in my opinion, to be a very effective and promising method in the process of 3-dimensional visualization of that structure. And together with the construction of a vector combining an appropriate set of features, this method is especially desired, since it may contribute to further improving the diagnostic accuracy.

In the opinion of experts, the surface area and the skeleton cruciate ligament are properly matched features.

The MRI study is a golden standard in the diagnostics of cruciate ligaments injuries. However, the consequences of performing this study on the wrong class of equipment or in the wrong way should be kept in mind. Thus, each additional element supporting the diagnosis is important. Such is the role of the proposed feature vector. This vector is the next stage in computer aided diagnostics of the knee joint, comprising three-dimensional models of the following structures: bones and both posterior and anterior cruciate ligaments.
