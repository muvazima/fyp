                  This paper provides a new model of network formation that bridges the gap between the two benchmark game-theoretic models by Bala and Goyal (2000a) – the one-way flow model, and the two-way flow model – and includes both as limiting cases. As in both the said models, a link can be initiated unilaterally by any player with any other in what we call an “asymmetric flow” network, and the flow through a link towards the player who supports it is perfect. Unlike those models, there is friction or decay in the opposite direction. When this decay is complete there is no flow and this corresponds to the one-way flow model. The limit case when the decay in the opposite direction (and asymmetry) disappears corresponds to the two-way flow model. We characterize stable and strictly stable architectures for the whole range of parameters of this “intermediate” and more general model. A study of the efficiency of these architectures shows that in general stability and efficiency do not go together. We also prove the convergence of Bala and Goyal’s dynamic model in this context.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The “area statement” corresponding to “Games, Information, and Networks” in the prestigious journal Operations Research states the following: “A fundamental understanding of network behavior, including the nature of interconnections, issues of stability, and decision making place operations research methodology at the core of this emerging research program.” This work seeks to contribute to the theoretical foundations of this research program at a methodological level.
                        2
                        Increasing attention to networks in different contexts is perceptible in operational research literature. Usually, applied to different problems (e.g. flow optimization for evacuation planning (Lim, Zangeneh, Baharnemati, & Assavapokee, 2012), terrorism (Lindelauf, Hamers, & Husslage, 2013), network security (Skorin-Kapova, Furdeka, Aparicio Pardo, & Pavón Mariño, 2012)); but also addressing theoretical issues (e.g. models of opinion dynamics (Acemoğlu, Como, Fagnani, & Ozdaglar, 2013), network formation and stability (Dieker & Shin, 2013; Harmsen-van Hout, Herings, & Dellaert, 2013; Janssen & Monsuur, 2012; Monsuur, 2007).
                     
                     
                        2
                      More specifically, we address the issue of stability and dynamics in models of network formation. The possibility of generating complex structures from simple assumptions is interesting in various contexts.
                        3
                        A remarkable example is Conway’s Game of Life (Gardner, 1970).
                     
                     
                        3
                      In the context of networks, where complexity is often an unavoidable ingredient, it is also interesting to provide models that generate simple or relatively simple structures from simple assumptions. In this line of research, the seminal paper by Bala and Goyal (2000a) introduced two benchmark game-theoretic models of network formation: the “one-way flow” model, and the “two-way flow” model. In both models each player can unilaterally create (i.e. initiate and support) links at a given cost with any other player, and the objective is to receive the maximal flow at the minimum cost.
                        4
                        In Jackson and Wolinsky’s (1996) model the formation of a link between two players requires the agreement of both. See Hellmann and Staudigl (2014) for a review on social network formation which includes a brief discussion of these basic game-theoretic models.
                     
                     
                        4
                      These two models differ in the way that the information and other benefits flow through the resulting network. In the one-way flow model the flow through a link runs only towards the player that supports it, while in the two-way flow model the flow through a link runs in both directions irrespective of who supports it. It is not surprising that such different models yield very different conclusions. In the absence of friction or decay, stable (in the sense of Nash equilibrium) networks are merely those minimally connected in either model, which means completely different architectures in each case.
                        5
                        Connectedness in the one-way flow model requires the existence of an oriented path from any player to any other player, while in the two-way flow model it only requires the existence of a path, and the orientation of the links is indifferent. “Minimal” in both cases means that every link is necessary to keep the network connected. Thus, minimal connectedness yields different architectures in each model.
                     
                     
                        5
                      The situation is also completely different in regard to stability in the strict Nash sense (i.e. where any unilateral deviation of any player means a loss): in the one-way flow model the “wheel” is the only strictly stable architecture, while in the two-way flow model the only strictly stable architecture is the “center-sponsored star”. Despite the elegance of these results, the extreme simplicity of the emerging structures
                        6
                        In the presence of decay, things become much more complicated, but remain very different from one model to the other.
                     
                     
                        6
                      – stars and wheels – is somewhat disappointing. Richer structures might have been expected to emerge even from simple assumptions.

Both models have been extended in several directions, but those extensions take one model or the other as their starting point and ignore the other.
                        7
                        The two-way flow model has received more attention, see e.g. Bala and Goyal (2000b), Goyal and Vega-Redondo (2005), Galeotti, Goyal, and Kamphorst (2006), McBride (2006), Feri (2007), Hojman and Szeidl (2008), and Bloch and Dutta (2009). For extensions of the one-way flow model see Galeotti (2006), Billand, Bravard, and Sarangi (2008), Derks, Kuipers, Tennekes, and Thuijsman (2009), and Derks and Tennekes (2009). We also address separately the extension of either model in the presence of constraints (Olaizola & Valenciano, 2013a, 2013b). Excellent books surveying this literature are Goyal (2007), Jackson (2008) and Vega-Redondo (2007). See also Jackson’s (2010) survey.
                     
                     
                        7
                      To the best of our knowledge, no joint generalization has been provided so far, that is, no model has been proposed that integrates both models as particular cases. Notwithstanding, these two models look like extreme cases in an unspecified sense of an unspecified model, so different that they are hard to compare given the lack of intermediate models. One may, for instance, wonder about how the “transition” from wheels to stars occurs, but no transition is possible without intermediate situations or models. This paper provides such an “intermediate” model: a model of network formation that in fact includes Bala and Goyal’s models as particular extreme cases.

As in those two models, a link can be initiated unilaterally by any player with any other in what we call an “asymmetric flow” network. As in the one-way flow model (without decay), the flow towards the player who initiates a link is perfect, without friction or decay, but in the opposite direction it is not. More precisely, if player i supports a link with j but player j does not support a link with i, all the information at node j reaches i without friction through this link, but only a fraction 
                     
                        
                           α
                        
                      of the information at node i reaches j through this link. Note that when 
                        
                           α
                           =
                           0
                        
                      this is the one-way flow model, while when 
                        
                           α
                           =
                           1
                        
                      the asymmetry of flow disappears and this is the two-way flow model. A second parameter of the model is the cost c (which we assume to be homogeneous across players) of initiating a link. Thus, Bala and Goyal’s models are actually the limiting cases of this asymmetric flow model.

This new model has inherent interest per se, apart from the nice fact of including both benchmark models as extreme cases. It is worth noting that asymmetry actually occurs in different contexts. In many situations the flow of information between two agents is not equally fluent in both directions. Also, information which is supposed to flow only unidirectionally may suffer some sort of leakage in the opposite direction. Asymmetry also appears in telecommunications, where within the bandwidth of a system data speed and quantity differs from one direction to the other direction. In all these cases there is two-way asymmetric flow (or “asymmetric flow” for short).

Unilateral formation and asymmetric flow combine in some situations. For instance, the information flow within a network of informers, e.g., about catastrophes such as fires and earthquakes. In the academic world, quotations between authors and recommendations, where it is prestige that flows to some extent in both directions, are basically unilateral decisions with asymmetric consequences. Websites’ links to other websites provide another example. This model can also be seen as complementary to the two-way asymmetric model of public relationships by Grunig (2001), where the point is to emit information and feedback is allowed but secondary. Finally, abundant asymmetric relationships are also conspicuous in the animal kingdom. A good example is provided by symbiotic relationships between individuals of different species from which two individuals benefit and which are often initiated unilaterally.

Thus, examples where asymmetry is present in bilateral relationships or transmissions and/or connections are created unilaterally abound. How each specific case should be treated is a different issue. In particular, the adequacy of a network formation model depends on the situation considered. In this respect, we have chosen basically the economically motivated model of network formation used by Bala and Goyal (2000a). On the plus side there is in the first place the simplicity of this decentralized formation model, which allows for a noncooperative game-theoretic analysis. This along with the asymmetric flow assumption provides a model which bridges the gap between Bala and Goyal’s models and raises questions about stable, strictly stable and efficient architectures, the answers to which go beyond the dichotomy of “wheels versus stars”. Here again wheels and center-sponsored stars are encountered (for certain configurations of values of the two parameters 
                        
                           α
                        
                      and c), but so are new, richer structures such as root-oriented trees, with the oriented line as an extreme case among them, and other more complex architectures. We study the ranges for the parameters where such architectures are strictly stable, which of them overlap and where (in particular this may be the case for wheels and stars for certain ranges of these parameters). In fact all these structures, including the oriented wheel and the center-sponsored star, turn out to be particular cases of a general architecture precisely described and characterized as the only one for which strict stability may hold. A similar study about non-strict stability yields a characterization of the architecture of Nash networks. We also study the efficiency of these architectures. By contrast with Bala and Goyal’s models, where efficiency and stability do not conflict, in the asymmetric flow model Nash and strict Nash networks may not be efficient and efficient networks may not be stable.

Finally, we address the extension of Bala and Goyal’s dynamic model and results. This extension is achieved at the cost of a lengthy algorithmic constructive proof of the existence of a sequence of best responses which yields a strict Nash network starting from an arbitrary network.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 an introductory example illustrates and anticipates in a simple context the general results presented later. Section 3 outlines the basic model and gives the necessary notation and terminology. Section 4 studies stability (Section 4.2) and strict stability (Section 4.1). Efficiency is briefly dealt with in Section 5. Section 6 applies Bala and Goyal’s dynamic model to this setting. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the main conclusions and lines of further research.

A brief discussion of the conclusions of stability for the simplest case, a three-player society, provides an easy advance illustration of the general model and results presented and proved in subsequent sections. Consider a three-player society and assume that (i) each node has an information of value 1 for the other players; (ii) information flows through a link without loss in the direction of the player that supports it, but only a fraction

                     ) flows in the opposite direction; and (iii) the cost of initiating a link is c (
                        
                           0

                     ). Given the small number of essentially different structures for a three-player network, it can easily be checked that the only architectures that can be strict Nash are the oriented wheel, the center-sponsored star and the oriented line (each of them for a certain range of the parameters 
                     
                        
                           α
                        
                      
                     and c). These three structures are shown in Fig. 1
                      along with the payoff of each player, the condition for strict stability of each structure and the aggregate payoff.
                        8
                        Nodes are represented by dots (without labels unless convenient), and links by arrows between them with the convention that the node at the tip of the arrow supports it.
                     
                     
                        8
                      In the case of the oriented wheel, there is an oriented path between any two nodes, therefore each node receives the information from the other two without loss, and pays a single link. Hence all nodes receive the same payoff

                     . Since each node receives the information from the other two without loss, adding a new link cannot be part of a best response, and then the only possible deviating best response of a player would consist of deleting her/his single link, which would mean a payoff of

                     . Therefore, the oriented wheel is strictly stable if and only if

                     . In a center-sponsored star, the node at the center of the star supports links with the other two nodes, thus receiving the information from both of them without loss at the cost of two links, which means a payoff of

The most rewarding among such responses would be that of the player supporting no links initiating a new link with the player at the root of the line, which receives all the information without friction. This would mean a payoff of

                      . Note that this condition is the reverse of the condition of strict stability for the oriented wheel. It is easy to check that no other structure with three players can be strictly stable.

                      the line is strict Nash but the wheel is not. In short, parabola

                      divides the region of possible values of the parameters into two disjoint regions: below it the wheel is strict Nash but the line is not, and above it the line is strict Nash but the wheel is not. The third structure, the center-sponsored star, is strictly stable above the straight line 
                        
                           c

                     , thus sharing strict stability first with the wheel and then with the line. Finally, as mentioned previously, it is easy to check that no other architecture is strict Nash for any value of the parameters. Note also that the points with the form 
                        
                           (
                           0
                           ,
                           c
                           )
                        
                      in the rectangle represented correspond to the one-way flow model, where the only strict Nash architecture is the wheel, and those with the form 
                        
                           (
                           1
                           ,
                           c
                           )
                        
                      correspond to the two-way flow model, where the only strict Nash architecture is the center-sponsored star.

As for non-strict Nash stability, the only architecture apart from the three considered above that can be stable consists of four links, where one player links with the other two and s/he is linked by both. This structure is stable for 
                        
                           c
                           ⩽

Now consider efficiency in the sense of aggregate payoff. The following conclusions may be reached for the three possible architectures of a strict Nash network. The aggregate payoff of the wheel is

                     , that of the center-sponsored star is

Moreover, it can easily be checked that in the first region it is the wheel that is more efficient than any other network architecture, while in the other two regions it is the oriented line. But observe that in view of the analysis of strict stability, in the region between parabolas

As the reader may guess, matters become more complex when the number of players increases. Nevertheless, we show that things remain tractable and results extend in a smooth and clear way. In particular, oriented wheels and root-oriented trees are stable for certain ranges of values of the parameters,
                        9
                        Observe that for the three-player case the center-sponsored star and the oriented line are the only root-oriented trees, while in general they are only the two extreme cases: the shortest and the longest oriented trees.

                      but other more complex structures appear as Nash and as strict Nash networks for certain values of the parameters, though they are all particular cases of a general pattern.

One network is said to be more efficient than another when the aggregate payoff is greater. A network is efficient if it maximizes the aggregate payoff.

In this section, we study the stability in the network formation game specified in the preceding section. Following Bala and Goyal (2000a), we consider two notions of stability: in the sense of Nash equilibrium and in the stronger sense of strict Nash equilibrium. We address this issue in two separate subsections: we first focus our attention on strict Nash networks (Section 4.1), and only when this issue is solved do we address the question of non-strict stability (Section 4.2).

Thus, in a strict Nash network a unilateral change of strategy means a loss for the player who deviates.

As a term of reference we first establish the range of values for the parameters within which the oriented wheel, the center-sponsored star and the oriented line are strict Nash networks. Let g be an N-network and

                        . Nodes in M form an oriented wheel, a wheel for short,
                           12
                           In the literature the adjective “oriented” is often omitted, so an oriented wheel is usually called just a wheel. But given the importance of its oriented nature we choose to use the term at least in the statement of the results, omitting it sometimes in the text for the sake of brevity. The same applies for oriented lines and trees as defined below.

In a center-sponsored star the center plays its only best response given that

                                        and consequently deleting a link would mean a loss. The payoff of each spoke agent is

                                       , while initiating the most rewarding link, i.e. with the center, would mean

                                             1
                                             -

                                             (

                                       , which yields the necessary and sufficient condition.

In an oriented line, given that 
                                          
                                             c

                                       , deleting a link would mean a loss. The least demanding best response would be that of the player supporting no links and would consist of initiating a link with the player that receives all, i.e. 
                                          
                                             n
                                             -
                                             1
                                          
                                       , without friction. The condition for this not to be a best response is the exact reverse of the one obtained for the oriented wheel. Observe that the oriented wheel and the oriented line only differ in one link.□

                         shows the regions where each of these three architectures is strictly stable. The wheel is strict Nash below the polynomial function

                        , i.e. in regions I and II. The center-sponsored star is strict Nash above the straight line 
                           
                              c

                        , i.e. in regions II and III. Therefore both structures are strict Nash in region II. The line becomes strictly stable just where the wheel ceases to be so, i.e. in region III. As the number of players grows, the range of values of the parameters for which the wheel is strictly stable widens while those for the line and the star shrink.

Note that Fig. 2 represents the particular case for

                         there are no more strictly stable architectures, but this is not so for

                        . In particular, many more root-oriented trees other than the center-sponsored star and the oriented line appear, each of them strictly stable for a certain range of the parameters, as shown below. A root-oriented tree is a network where there is a single node

                        , and that path is

                        -oriented. Observe that in a root-oriented tree all the information in the tree reaches the root without friction (at the cost of as many links as the root supports), while all other nodes receive some of the information in the network with some loss. Note also that on going further down the tree away from the root by any path the amount of information that reaches a node diminishes. In particular, a terminal node pays no links but receives less information than its predecessors closer to the root. The following notation proves useful. Let g be an

That is, using (4), for all nodes other than the root inequality

                              . This condition is necessary for all players other than the root, but the payoffs of the terminal players improve most if they initiate a link with the root (they receive less information than their predecessors).

Thus, g is a strict Nash network if and only if the following condition holds for every terminal node i:

Observe that because the center-sponsored star and the oriented line are root-oriented trees parts (ii) and (iii) of Proposition 1 are now corollaries of Proposition 2. Nevertheless, the range of strict stability which has been established for each of the three architectures in Proposition 1 allows a clearer idea of the ranges of the new ones yet to be established. In particular, observe that the boundary above which condition (6) holds is within region II in Fig. 5. Indeed, the bound for the cost c in terms of

In summary, oriented wheels and root-oriented trees are strict Nash networks for certain ranges of values of the parameters. As we show below, there is a still more complex architecture that can be strictly stable, in fact an architecture that incorporates all the preceding ones as particular cases, which we call “wheel of trees”. A wheel of trees is a weakly connected network which consists of a set of nodes

In a wheel of trees there are only two possible types of best response for a player other than the one that s/he is currently playing: that of a player in the wheel deleting her/his link in the wheel, and that of a player not in the wheel initiating a link with any player in the wheel. For the first action not to be a best response the condition is similar to the one obtained for the wheel in Proposition 1, but now each of the nodes in the wheel has a “weight” other than 1 if a tree hangs from it. In order for a player, say

In fact, Proposition 3 contains Propositions 1 and 2. To see this note that when the central wheel collapses into a node (i.e.

At first sight the bounds for c between which a wheel of trees remains strict Nash may seem somewhat obscure. However, it is easy to see by exploiting their polynomial form that both bounds lie within region II in Fig. 5 (between the straight line

It may well be the case that for a certain wheel of trees the lower bound for c is greater than the upper bound for any

                                       , in which case it is never a strict Nash network. For instance, in the three-player case the wheel of trees where one player supports a link with each of the other two and only one of them supports a link with her/him is not a strict Nash network whatever the values of the parameters.

A delicate balance is required for the interval defined by (8), within which a wheel of trees is strictly stable, not to be empty. Some examples may help to understand this better.

                              Proposition 3 gives the range of parameters for which a wheel of trees is strict Nash. We now show that this is the only possible architecture of a strict Nash asymmetric flow network. The following straightforward lemma is most useful in characterizing strict Nash networks.

                              In the asymmetric flow model a network is strict Nash if and only if it is a wheel of trees that satisfies 
                              (8).

Sufficiency was established in Proposition 3, so it only remains to show necessity. Let g be a strict Nash network. Assume that g contains a sequence of players

Such a common predecessor must be unique, otherwise a set of players would be arranged as a wheel in g.

Summarizing the study of strict Nash asymmetric flow networks the following picture emerges as one moves from south-west to north-east in the rectangle containing all pairs of values of the two parameters of the model (or from

                               along any horizontal straight line 
                                 
                                    c

                              ). First only the oriented wheel is strict Nash (region I in Fig. 5), then the center-sponsored star also becomes strict Nash. Then, as one moves further right, other root-oriented trees also become strict Nash until the last tree, i.e. the oriented line, also becomes strict Nash. In this range of values for the parameters (region II) where wheels and trees coexist as strict Nash some wheels of trees also appear as strict Nash but, unlike root-oriented trees, which remain strict Nash as

                                 15
                                 Note that this “narrowness” particularly concerns 
                                       
                                          α
                                       
                                    , but for each

                                     within that narrow interval it may well be the case that a wheel of trees remains strictly stable for a relatively wide range of cost. See, for instance, Example 1.

                               of values within region II. Finally, as soon as the last tree (the oriented line) joins the set of strict Nash networks the wheel abandons it. All root-oriented trees remain strict Nash in region III, but when 
                                 
                                    α
                                    =

                               a discontinuity occurs and only the center-sponsored star survives as strict Nash.

It is worth noting the different images of the two limiting cases, 
                           
                              α

                         and 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              1
                           
                        , from the point of view provided by the asymmetric flow model. The case 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0
                           
                         appears as just the case of maximal asymmetry and the conclusions about strict Nash networks for this case (i.e. the one-way flow model) remain unchanged for a wide range of values of the parameters. By contrast, when asymmetry disappears for 
                           
                              α

                         a discontinuity occurs: for values of 
                           
                              α
                           
                         slightly smaller than 1 all root-oriented trees are strict Nash, but only the center-sponsored star remains strict Nash for 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              1
                           
                        .

Note that Lemma 1 can be rephrased like this: if g is a strict Nash network then the outdegree of any node in g is 0 or 1. In Derks and Tennekes (2009), a network where all nodes have outdegree 0 or 1 is called proper.
                        
                           16
                           This notion is instrumental in the proof of existence of Nash networks in their setting. Their constructive proof yields a proper network, but they do not pay special attention to the architecture of such networks.
                        
                        
                           16
                         Thus, Lemma 1 establishes that every strict Nash network is proper. In fact, a careful examination of the proof of Theorem 1 shows that it is entirely based on Lemma 1, that is, on the proper character of g. Thus the proof of sufficiency in Theorem 1 can easily be adapted almost intact to prove the following.
                           Corollary 1
                           
                              A weakly connected proper network is necessarily a wheel of trees.
                           

Nevertheless, we prefer the term “wheel of trees” to that of weakly connected “proper network” because this architecture emerged in our constructive process in search of strict Nash networks. Moreover, the characterizing theorem requires that architecture to be made explicit for the formulation of condition (8).

We now address the structure of non-strict Nash networks. As 
                           
                              c
                              <
                              1
                           
                        , the obvious first conclusion is that Nash networks are weakly connected. The following weak version of Lemma 1 is rich in implications about their architecture.

                               (case 2). In the first case Lemma 2 applies to both links, and can be repeatedly applied in either direction as far as the links have the same orientation as the preceding ones until either W or

                               is reached or an inverted link is met, but then the second case arises. In this case the reversed link has its tail closer to a wheel than its tip, so the subsequent links either all have this orientation until the wheel is reached and Lemma 2 can be applied as in the oriented case, or at some point case 1 re-emerges. Thus, whatever the path connecting i and

                              , each of its links belongs to an oriented wheel.□

Thus, a Nash network either contains no oriented wheel or wheels that are all interconnected. A maze of oriented wheels within a network is referred to as a subnetwork consisting of a set of oriented wheels such that for any two wheels W and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    W

                         in this set there is a sequence of oriented wheels in the set s.t. the first is W, the last is 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    W
                                 
                                 
                                    ′
                                 
                              
                           
                        , and any two consecutive wheels in the sequence share at least one node. In order to simplify the statement of the result below the degenerate case of a single node is included as a maze of oriented wheels. This gives the following result.
                           Theorem 2
                           
                              In the asymmetric flow model the only possible architecture of a Nash network is that of a weakly connected network with at most one strong component consisting of a maze of wheels which is minimally strongly connected plus a number of root-oriented trees whose roots belong to the maze.
                           

First assume that g contains an oriented wheel. Therefore, from Lemma 3 all oriented wheels are interconnected and form a maze of wheels. If the maze contains all nodes the proof is complete. Otherwise, by reasoning exactly as in Theorem 1, the conclusion is that any other player lies in a root-oriented tree whose root belongs to the maze. If the network does not contain any oriented wheels, in view of Lemma 2 no three nodes

                                        but not every network with this architecture is a Nash network. As was the case for strict Nash networks, for this to be true some conditions involving the parameters must hold. First, every terminal node of the trees sets a lower bound for c similar to the one in (8), but now with non-strict inequality. Second, every link in the maze sets an upper bound for c, but now the variety of mazes makes it impossible to formulate them as precisely as for a strict Nash network beyond the following general condition: for every node i in the maze, and every

Observe that a strict Nash network is a Nash network whose “maze” consists of at most one single oriented wheel.

In a Nash network the nodes in the maze receive all the information from the network without decay (i.e.

A comparative study of the relative efficiency of the oriented wheel, the center-sponsored star and the oriented line such as the one in the introduction yields the following results. In an n-player society the aggregate payoff of the oriented wheel is

                     Thus, the oriented line is always beaten by the wheel or the star but, unlike in the three-player case discussed in the introduction, it may be that none of these structures is efficient. For instance, for 
                        
                           n
                           =
                           5
                        
                      and a certain range of values, the efficient network is a root-oriented tree of length 2 where the root supports only one link. A comparison with the two models by Bala and Goyal (2000a) is pertinent here. In the two-way flow model (
                        
                           α
                           =
                           1
                        
                     ) all Nash networks, strict or not, are efficient, while in the one-way flow model (
                        
                           α
                           =
                           0
                        
                     ) not all Nash networks are efficient, but the strict Nash networks (i.e. the oriented wheels) are.
                        19
                        A certain similarity is perceptible here. In the asymmetric flow model, any non-strict Nash network is less efficient than the strict Nash network that results by replacing the central maze by a single oriented wheel connecting its players.
                     
                     
                        19
                      In contrast, as seen in the three-player case and as is the case in general, in the asymmetric flow model Nash and strict Nash networks may not be efficient and efficient networks may not be stable. In other words, efficiency and stability do not in general go hand in hand in the asymmetric flow model.

We now consider Bala and Goyal (2000a) dynamic model in this setting. Namely, starting from any initial network g, in each period each player i responds, independently from the others, with a positive probability with a best response to 
                        
                           
                              
                                 g
                              
                              
                                 -
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                      (this includes any strategy that yields the same payoff to i as the current one when no strategy can improve i’s payoff), or randomizes across them when there are more than one. Otherwise, player i exhibits inertia, i.e. keeps her/his links unchanged. Note that in this model “miscoordination” is possible as a result of simultaneous best responses. We call this model simultaneous best response dynamics, by contrast with sequential best response dynamics, where in each period a single player chosen at random plays a best response while all other players keep their links unchanged, thus eliminating the possibility of miscoordination. In both cases, a Markov chain on the state space of all networks is defined. Bala and Goyal (2000a) prove that the sequential best response dynamic model converges to the oriented wheel for the one-way flow model, while the simultaneous best response dynamic model converges to the center-sponsored star for the two-way flow model. They prove this by showing that a finite sequence of best responses exists starting from any network, that leads to a strict Nash network.

                     , any network which is the result of a best response of a player is necessarily weakly connected. Note that, since 
                        
                           c
                           <
                           1
                        
                     , the player that plays it must be connected by a path with any other player in the resulting network, which, as 
                        
                           0

                                 It suffices to show that starting from any network, a sequence of best responses exists where at each stage a single node plays a best response while the others exhibit inertia that ends up generically at a strict Nash network. Given the complexity of generating such a sequence, we provide an algorithmic proof organized in three steps. First, we show that from any network a finite sequence of best responses exists which yields a network where at least one player receives all the information without loss (Lemma 4). We then prove that from any such network a sequence of best responses exists which yields a wheel of trees (Algorithm 1). Finally, we show that starting from any wheel of trees a sequence of best responses exists which generically yields a strict Nash network (Algorithm 2).

In this case, sequential best response dynamics would perpetually oscillate between these two architectures, but allowing for simultaneous moves convergence to a strict Nash network is guaranteed (Remarks after Claim 6 and Corollary 2).□

In view of Lemma 4, in order to prove the existence of the desired sequence of best responses, it is sufficient to prove it for networks where at least one player receives all the information without loss. The following algorithm takes one such network as its input and its output is a wheel of trees. The algorithm exploits this idea: if a player receives 
                        
                           n
                           -
                           1
                        
                     , a best response of any other player consists either of supporting a link with that player and deleting all links that are not necessary for receiving 
                        
                           n
                           -
                           1
                        
                     , or deleting all links but those whose deletion would mean a loss.

Let us see first that both procedures specify best responses after which the reference node keeps receiving all the information without loss.

                           and then Procedure 1 specifies a best response of j, or no best response of j includes link

                           and then Procedure 2 specifies a best response of j. In both cases, after the procedure, the (same or new) reference node keeps receiving information

                              Note that in both cases such a best response may coincide with j’s current strategy. In this case the network remains unchanged, but W and V (in Procedure 1) or

                           . Thus in all cases the outdegree of every node in g is 0 or 1. As established in Claim 1, the reference node receives all the information intact, therefore g is surely weakly connected. This along with Corollary 1 yields that g is a wheel of trees.□

Therefore the sequence of best responses generated by Algorithm 1 yields a wheel of trees which is the input of a second algorithm. The following lemma
                        23
                        The idea of this lemma was suggested to us by a referee, who also detected an important mistake in the first version of this second algorithm. With the help of this simple fact we were able to overcome the difficulties and prove a stronger result.

                           , where k is the number of nodes in the wheel (i.e. the central wheel is not a single node and there is at least one tributary tree), if breaking the wheel is a best response of a node i that does not support a tributary tree, then the node in the wheel supporting a link with i has a greater incentive than i to break it. Consequently, in these conditions, at least one of the nodes whose best response is to break the wheel roots a tributary tree.

                            is superfluous and severing it yields a new wheel larger than the previous one. Since breaking the wheel was not a best response for i in the previous wheel it cannot be one now either. Thus, the output of Procedure 3 is a wheel of trees which is the result of a sequence of two best responses, and V contains one more node.□

Therefore at some point the algorithm necessarily stops at END-2 yielding a strict Nash network. When

                                     is just a way of forcing the algorithm to stop in this case. When

                                     is an oriented wheel, and the algorithm stops at END-1.□

It only remains to prove that the algorithm necessarily terminates in finite time.
                        Claim 6
                        
                           When its input is a wheel of trees, Algorithm 2 
                           terminates in finite time.
                        

First note that every time a new wheel of trees is formed from another wheel of trees, a new node in the new central wheel supporting a single link joins V, and links in V never again have a chance to break a wheel in the algorithm. This means that the cycle that follows Q3 in either of the two possible ways cannot be repeated more than n times. Therefore the algorithm is certain to finish.□

                                 Observe that inertia has played an implicit role in the algorithms, as it has been implicitly assumed that at each best response in the sequence all other players maintain their strategies, but miscoordination has played no role. In other words, it has been proved that sequential best response dynamics converge to a strict Nash network except perhaps when the parameters are within the curve

Nevertheless, in this case a miscoordination simultaneous move in the wheel where more than one node deletes its only link followed by a best response of an appropriate single node would yield an oriented tree which is strict Nash throughout the curve.

Note that in Procedure 2 of Algorithm 2, if linking the root is a best response of a terminal node i in the tree, and i is indifferent between playing it or not, then unless the resulting wheel of trees is an oriented wheel Lemma 5 ensures that in the new central wheel at least one player will strictly improve her/his payoff by breaking it. Similarly, again by Lemma 5, when in Procedure 1 breaking the wheel is a best response of a node i which roots no tributary tree

                                     will strictly improve its payoff by linking up the root in the resulting tree. This means that indifference, i.e. best responses which do not entail a strict improvement, do not entail any risk of circularity, i.e. the process goes ahead. In fact, circularity only could occur between oriented line and wheel architectures for a zero-measure set of values of the parameters, but in that case the clause “if

                                    , then stop” prevents it.

This concludes the proof of Theorem 3. Moreover, in view of the preceding discussion, we have the following strengthening of its part (i).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We provide a new model of non-cooperative network formation with asymmetric flow which bridges the gap between two benchmark game-theoretic models so far seen as “orthogonal”, and gives rise to a significant variety of stable architectures. The beauty and elegance of Bala and Goyal’s results for their two models, yielding two primary and emblematic architectures, the wheel and the star, as strict Nash networks gives rise at the same time to a certain uneasiness as one feels that other structures should also arise from simple assumptions. It turns out that just a little asymmetry opens the door to another remarkable structure – root-oriented trees – as strictly stable, and also, within a margin for the parameters, the interesting wheels of trees, which are midway between the wheel and the star and include both as particular cases.

From the point of view provided by the asymmetric flow model, the two-way flow model appears as an extreme and somehow pathological case: in a center-sponsored star one player pays everything and everybody sees everything, while in the asymmetric flow model in a center-sponsored star the center pays everything but receives more information than anybody else, and in other stable architectures players receive more or less information depending on their position. Thus stability and asymmetry yield a clear hierarchy from the point of view of the amount of information received. In both Nash and strict Nash architectures, one set of players, the root in the tree, the central wheel in the wheel of trees and the maze in a Nash network, receives all the information intact from the network, while the rest, plugged into tributary trees, receive it with a certain decay. It is remarkable how such simple premises yield these structures in equilibrium, which embody logic from the informational point of view and appear as meaningful information-processing proto-structures. As for efficiency, it turns out that, by contrast with Bala and Goyal’s models, efficiency and stability do not in general go hand in hand in the asymmetric flow model.

Finally, it has also proved possible to produce a smooth extension of Bala and Goyal’s results about dynamics, although the greater complexity of the new setting requires a lengthy algorithmic constructive proof.

The model opens up several lines for further research. Note that if a certain decay 
                        
                           β
                           ⩾
                           α
                        
                      is also assumed in the flow through a link towards the player that supports it, then the model includes also as limit cases the one-way and two-way flow models with decay. Namely, in this model with “asymmetric decay”, the case 
                        
                           0

                           α
                           =
                           0
                        
                      is the one-way flow model with decay, while the case 
                        
                           0
                           <

                           1
                        
                      is the two-way flow model with decay. Here again the two-parameter (
                        
                           α

                     ) model covers all intermediate situations between the two models. Therefore, all the extensions explored in the literature for either of the two models of Bala and Goyal (2000a) can be studied taking the asymmetric flow model as the point of departure. One of these extensions consists of introducing different forms of heterogeneity. In this respect, the asymmetric flow model studied assumes homogeneity for the two parameters

                           α

                     , as a model of a form of parasitism, possibly under different assumptions about network formation. Still within the framework of the model considered here, it may be of interest to introduce mistakes into the dynamic model in order to study the stochastic stability of strict equilibria.

                      Finally, it may also be interesting to examine the effects of asymmetric flow on models based on pairwise stability à la Jackson and Wolinsky (1996).
