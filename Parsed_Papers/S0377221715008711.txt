                  A cooperative game consists of a set of players and a characteristic function determining the maximal gain or minimal cost that every subset of players can achieve when they decide to cooperate, regardless of the actions that the other players take. The relationships of closeness among the players should modify the bargaining among them and therefore their payoffs. The first models that have studied this closeness used a priori unions or undirected graphs. In the a priori union model a partition of the big coalition is supposed. Each element of the partition represents a group of players with the same interests. The groups negotiate among them to form the grand coalition and later, inside each one, players bargain among them. Now we propose to use proximity relations to represent leveled closeness of the interests among the players and extending the a priori unions model.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cooperative game theory studies situations where a set of agents (players) bargain for a fair allocation of a common profit resulting from their collaboration, namely a vector with the payoff of each player as coordinates (a payoff vector). In order to establish this allocation a number is known for each subset (coalition) of players representing the profit obtained by them and the mapping that assigns these numbers is named the characteristic function of the game. The Shapley value, Shapley (1953), is one of the point solutions for cooperative games mostly used and studied. It is a function obtaining a payoff vector for each game based in a set of reasonable conditions (axioms) which allow us to decide whether this value is or not the best solution for the problem. Several variations of the Shapley value have been proposed for situations where some additional information about the agents is known. Aumann and Dreze (1974) introduced coalition structures. A coalition structure is a partition of the set of players representing the different coalitions obtained at the end of game. Hence there should be no side payment between these final coalitions. This way has been improved by Myerson (1977) considering communication structures. A communication structure is a graph representing the bilateral cooperation possibilities among the agents. In this case the final coalition structure is the set of connected components in the graph but we can also use the information given by the graph about the internal structure of these coalitions. Owen (1977) proposed a different model from that of Aumann and Dreze based in a different interpretation of the coalition structures. He considered that the coalition structure is a partition of the set of players in a priori unions based in the relations among the agents. But these unions are not considered as a final structure but as a starting point for further negotiations. Thus, as in the original Shapley model, the grand coalition is the final coalition structure. This paper focuses on the Owen variation. So, a coalition of players forms a union if they have the same (or close) interests in the game. Owen obtained a Shapley-type solution (the Owen value) taking into account this information to get a fair allocation of the profit of the grand coalition. Later Casajus (2007) proposed a modification of the Owen model in the Myerson sense. That is, we have an a priori union structure and we know how these unions are formed by means of a connected graph in each group. This graph explains the relation of closeness existing among their players. But closeness is usually a leveled property. For instance, political groups can be organized in a priori ideological unions. Considering equal every ideological closeness between two political parties is actually a simplification of the situation. Aubin (1981), Butnariu (1980) and Mares (2001) introduced fuzzy sets to describe leveled participation of the players in the coalitions (fuzzy coalitions) or fuzziness in the worth of the coalitions given by the characteristic function (fuzzy payoffs). The Choquet integral, Choquet (1953), is a powerful tool from the decision theory which is a way of measuring the expected utility of an uncertain event. Tsurumi, Tanino, and Inuiguchi (2001) used the Choquet integral for fuzzy sets in order to define a Shapley-type solution of a family of games with fuzzy coalitions. Jiménez-Losada, Fernández, Ordóñez, and Grabisch (2010) 
                     Jiménez-Losada, Fernández, and Ordóñez (2013); Gallego, Fernández, Jiménez-Losada, and Ordóñez (2014) and Gallardo, Jiménez, Jiménez-Losada, and Lebrón (2014) proposed to use fuzzy structures as an additional information for a cooperative game. Particularly, they considered a fuzzy graph to study fuzzy communication structures in the Myerson way. Meng, Zhang, and Cheng (2012) analyzed games on fuzzy coalitions with a priori unions.

Now, we propose a more realistic version of the Owen situation. Following Owen (1977) and Casajus (2007) we consider a fuzzy graph where the fuzzy set of links defines the objective bilateral closeness of interests among the players. This structure is actually a known fuzzy binary relation called proximity relation. This fuzzy relation also establishes unions among the agents but these are not disjoint and each union is represented by a communication structure, thus players are asymmetric in them. While Meng et al. (2012) considered fuzzy coalitions but common a priori unions, we will take usual games but leveled closeness. Preliminaries introduce the needed aspects from cooperative games, a priori unions, communication structures and fuzzy sets to understand the paper. Section 3 analyzes the value introduced by Casajus (2007) in a different way, obtaining an axiomatization comparable to the one of the Owen value. In Section 4 we introduce several ways to reduce a proximity relation which are used later. Section 5 defines an Owen-type value for proximity situations, the prox-Owen value and finally in Section 6 we propose an axiomatization of the new value with reasonable axioms in this context.

A cooperative game with transferable utility, a game since now, is a pair (N, v) where N is a finite set of elements and 
                           
                              v
                              :

                              R
                           
                         is a mapping satisfying 
                           
                              v
                              (

                        . The elements of N are named players, the subsets of N are said coalitions and v is the characteristic function of the game. We denote as G the set of games. If (N, v) ∈ G and S ⊆ N then

                                 )

                         is a new game where vS

                        : T ⊆ N} is a basis of the games over N, that is for every (N, v) there are coefficients cT

                         is a partition of N. Players in Nk
                         for each k have similar interests in the game and they use the union in the bargaining to get a fair payoff. The set of games with a priori unions is denoted as GU.

The Owen value ω is an allocation rule over GU. It is supposed that players are interested in the grand coalition N but considering the a priori unions as bargaining elements. Let (N, v, P) ∈ GU with

                         from now on. A communication structure for N is a graph (N, L) where the set of vertices is N and the set of edges L ⊆ LN is the set of feasible communications among them. Hence we identify a communication structure for N with the set of links L. A game with communication structure is a triple (N, v, L) where (N, v) ∈ G and L is a communication structure for N. A cooperative game (N, v) can be identified with the game with communication structure (N, v, LN). The family of games with communication structure is denoted as GC. Let (N, v, L) ∈ GC be a game with communication structure. A coalition S ⊆ N whose vertices are connected by the links in L is called connected. The maximal connected coalitions correspond to the sets of vertices of the connected components of the graph (N, L) and they are denoted as N/L. This family N/L is actually a partition of N. If S ⊆ N is a coalition then

                        ) ∈ GC represents the restriction to S of the game and the communication structure. We use 
                           
                              S

                        . Following Myerson (1977), in a communication structure the final coalition structure is formed by the connected components of the graph, and they cannot get beneficial collaborations among them.

The Myerson value is an allocation rule for games with communication structure. Given (N, v, L) ∈ GC Myerson defines a new game (N, v/L) ∈ G incorporating the information of the communication structure,

A bilateral fuzzy relation, see Mordeson and Nair (2000), over K is a function ρ: K × K → [0, 1] satisfying the condition ρ(i, j) ≤ ρ(i, i)∧ρ(j, j). A proximity relation over K, is a fuzzy relation ρ satisfying: (Reflexivity)

In the Owen model players are organized in a priori unions but there is not information about the inner structure of these unions. Casajus (2007) proposed another allocation rule for games with communication structure following the sense of the Owen value that we name here the Myerson-Owen value. Given a game with communication structure (N, v, L) ∈ GC we consider the partition of N by its connected components N/L. Therefore N/L is a set of a priori unions for the players in N but the links in L establish how these unions are formed. We use again the quotient game (3) with the partition

                     Casajus (2007) obtained an axiomatization of the Myerson–Owen value. Now we provide a new characterization of this value with the purpose of defining all the axioms from the data (the game and the graph) and obtaining a better comparison with the Owen value. Consider the following axioms for ψ an allocation rule over GC.

Observe that now a null player can obtain profit due to his position in the graph inside a component if this position is essential for other players to cooperate. But if all the players in the component are null then it is impossible to get profits despite the strategic position inside the union of each player. A coalition S ⊆ N is a null coalition in (N, v) ∈ G if each i ∈ S is a null player for (N, v).

Now the equal treatment property for players depends on the structure in each component because they are asymmetric. The Myerson fairness axiom cannot be used to explain this asymmetry because the deletion of a link can cause a change in the number of components (unions) and then in the bargaining among them. So, we use the modified fairness proposed by Casajus (2007). This axiom can be seen as a balance among unilateral disconnection threats. The difference of payoffs for breaking up unilaterally a link, placing the players disconnected by this fact out of the game, is the same for both players in the link. Let (N, v, L) ∈ GC and ij ∈ L.

                           Casajus (2007) proved that the Myerson–Owen value satisfies efficiency and modified fairness but we replicate the proofs because they are used in the remark just after the theorem.
                     
                     
                        Theorem 1
                        
                           The Myerson–Owen value is the only allocation rule for games with communication structure satisfying the following axioms: efficiency, linearity, null component, substitutable components and modified fairness.
                        

We will test that each one of the axioms is satisfied by the Myerson–Owen value. Let (N, v, L) ∈ GC,

Suppose ψ, ψ′ different values over GC satisfying the five axioms. We take the smallest N and L such that ψ ≠ ψ′. Hence there is a characteristic function v with ψ(N, v, L) ≠ ψ′(N, v, L). Linearity and (1) imply that there exists uT

Now we deal with the logical independence of the axioms. We need to find five allocation rules over GC different to the Myerson–Owen value satisfying four axioms of our set but not the other one. The Owen value,

As we say in Section 2.1 the Shapley value is the only one satisfying efficiency, linearity, null player and equal treatment. Furthermore these axioms are independent and then there exist four allocation rules for G,

                                    ϵ always satisfies modified fairness.

ϵ satisfies efficiency if and only if ψ
                                    ϵ does.

ϵ satisfies linearity if and only if ψ
                                    ϵ does.

ϵ satisfies null player if and only if ψ
                                    ϵ satisfies null component.

ϵ satisfies equal treatment if and only if ψ
                                    ϵ satisfies substitutable components.

                        Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. Let a, b ∈ [0, 1] with a < b and a ≠ 0 or b ≠ 1. The dual interval scaling of ρ is a new proximity relation over N given by

                     Owen (1977) considered that the players in a game are organized in a priori unions (see Section 2.2) depending on their common interests. Now we suppose that it is possible to measure the closeness of the ideas of the players. In this order we are going to think of a proximity function describing the closeness among them. Let (N, v) ∈ G. If ρ is a proximity relation over N then ρ(i, j) represents the closeness level between players i, j ∈ N.

                        Definition 5
                        A game with a proximity relation among the players is a triple (N, v, ρ) such that (N, v) ∈ G is a game and ρ is a proximity relation over N. The set of the games with a proximity relation among the players is denoted as GP.

If we take a crisp proximity relation then we obtain a game over a communication structure in the sense of Casajus (2007), namely it is a set of a priori unions with a communication structure in each union. Particularly, if we consider a similarity relation, transitivity means here that if the measure of the facets of closeness between players i, k is ρ(i, k) and the one between players k, j is ρ(k, j) then i, j can assume at least (in the worst case) ρ(i, k)∧ρ(k, j) level of closeness. Games with crisp similarity relations are games with a priori unions. Next we see an example of a game with a proximity relation that is not any of these particular cases.

                        Suppose a set of five agents interested in making use of a land. They decide to cooperate getting the maximum feasible profit. Players 1, 2 are relatives, players 2, 3 are owners, players 1, 4, 5 are workers, 1, 2, 5 have been working together for a long time, and 1, 5 are beer friends.

                           Jiménez-Losada et al. (2010) introduced games on fuzzy communication structures using fuzzy graphs. In Jiménez-Losada et al. (2013) we proposed several Myerson values for these situations. Obviously a proximity relation is a particular kind of fuzzy graph, but our interpretation is different from the fuzzy communication structures. Now we extend the Owen model in a fuzzy way. We can see a proximity relation as a communication structure by levels of the players. Let (N, v, ρ) ∈ GP. For each t ∈ (0, 1] we suppose that a set of players form an a priori union with communication structure if they are connected at least at level t and this set is maximal.


                           Fig. 2 shows the different groups formed at each level t ∈ (0, 1] in the above example. Every group has a specific communication structure which determines how the union is formed. The reader can see for instance that if our demand to form a group is to connect them with level at least 
                              
                                 t
                                 =
                                 0.3
                              
                            then {1, 2, 5} is a union. But in this group the position of player 1 is not the same as in the others.

Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. We define the set function for every player i ∈ N given as

In a communication structure L ⊆ LN the set of coalitions which determines the a priori unions among the players are the connected components, the family N/L. In a proximity relation this role is played by the groups as we define now.

Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. A coalition S ⊆ N is a t-group for ρ with t ∈ (0, 1] if S ∈ N/[ρ]

Players in a null coalition do not obtain profit when the coalition is considered as a union or a partition of unions, but they can get profits as a coalition inside a bigger union depending on their position in the structure of this union. Therefore we can take these levels t ∈ (tS
                     , 1] as insignificant and rescale. The next axiom extends the null component property.

We extend the modified fairness axiom to a fuzzy situation. In this case, we take into account the mere reduction of the relation between two players. So we have to consider that this reduction of level only concerns to the interval between the reduced level and the original one.

The next theorem proves that the prox-Owen value is the only allocation rule satisfying all these axioms.

                        Theorem 7
                        
                           The prox-Owen value η is the only allocation rule over GP satisfying the following axioms: efficiency, null group, substitutable leveled groups, modified fuzzy fairness and linearity.
                        

We will test each one of the axioms.

                            and ρ is a crisp proximity relation. Hence in this case we obtain the uniqueness for the family of communication structures of the Myerson–Owen value (Theorem 1). We suppose that there is only one value for all the games with a proximity relation ρ with |im(ρ)| < d, d > 1.

Consider now a proximity relation ρ over N with

The prox-Owen value can be seen as a fuzzy version of the Myerson–Owen value for games with communication structures. Similarity relations is the subfamily of proximity relations associated to the a priori unions structures of Owen, because the bilateral relations among the players are transitive. Moreover if ρ is a similarity relation then [ρ]
                        t
                      is a structure of a priori unions for each t ∈ (0, 1]. We can obtain an axiomatization for the prox-Owen value over this subfamily. Obviously the prox-Owen value satisfies efficiency and linearity within this subfamily. As the restriction, the interval scaling and the dual interval scaling of a similarity relation are similarity relations then null group and substitutable leveled groups are also feasible axioms for similarity relations. Observe that the modified fuzzy fairness is not feasible because if we reduce the level of a pair of players we can break up the transitivity. In exchange, we introduce this other axiom used for the Owen value. For a similarity relation ρ and for two different players i, j ∈ N such that there is a group S ∈ N/ρ with i, j ∈ S we denote

                           The prox-Owen value is the only value over GS (the set of games with a similarity relation among the players) which satisfies efficiency, null group, substitutable leveled groups, substitutable players in a group and linearity.
                        

The uniqueness part is similar to Theorem 7 using substitutable players in a group instead of modified fuzzy fairness.

Hence we only have to check that the prox-Owen value satisfies substitutable players in a group over similarity relations. Let i, j ∈ N be two substitutable players in (N, v). As we said in Section 2.3 an a priori union structure is actually a communication structure L where every component is a complete graph, and

                           . Suppose L so. If i, j are in the same component in L the equal treatment for players in a union axiom (see Section 2.2) of the Owen value implies

We have introduced games with a proximity relation among the players. Proximity relations allow us to level the closeness relation among the players. This closeness can be interpreted as ideological proximity, social relation, economic interest or personal feeling. We propose an Owen-type value for these situations using the Choquet integral. Besides, an axiomatization for the value is given taking into account fuzzy conditions according to the context of the data. This work highlights how the properties of the Choquet integral are a powerful tool for the analysis of the fuzzy relations among the agents in a bargaining situation. The notation of the prox-Owen value as a Choquet integral simplifies the expression of the axioms and it also allows to see how the properties of the Choquet integral intervene in the proofs. Expression (11) shows the prox-Owen value as a linear combination of the Myerson–Owen value of the cuts. This formula is the calculus tool of the value as we show in the example. Also this last expression allows to interpret the axioms as intervals of different situations. Although the analysis of the proximity relations is a progress with respect to the foregoing knowledge in the Owen line, other interesting open problems are feasible using fuzzy tools.
