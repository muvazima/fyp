                  A novel optimal preventive maintenance policy for a cold standby system consisting of two components and a repairman is described herein. The repairman is to be responsible for repairing either failed component and maintaining the working components under certain guidelines. To model the operational process of the system, some reasonable assumptions are made and all times involved in the assumptions are considered to be arbitrary and independent. Under these assumptions, all system states and transition probabilities between them are analyzed based on a semi-Markov theory and a regenerative point technique. Markov renewal equations are constructed with the convolution of the cumulative distribution function of system time in each state and corresponding transition probability. By using the Laplace transform to solve these equations, the mean time from the initial state to system failure is derived. The optimal preventive maintenance policy that will provide the optimal preventive maintenance cycle is identified by maximizing the mean time from the initial state to system failure, and is determined in the form of a theorem. Finally, a numerical example and simulation experiments are shown which validated the effectiveness of the policy.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

When large-scale complex systems fail, the consequence on manufacturing and human safety can be devastating, such as when plants are shut down, chemical plants explode, or airplanes crash. However, due to site environments and economic reasons, it is almost impossible for practical engineering systems to realize zero risk and/or be completely safe. Therefore, knowing how to improve the system reliability and safety effectively is important. Consequently, improving preventive maintenance has become an efficient and objective approach to reducing risks.

Recently, the optimization of maintenance policies for repairable systems has attracted the attention of many researchers due to their various applications in engineering. From a methodology point of view, most optimal maintenance policies focus on modeling the repairable system and optimizing a certain performance indicator (e.g., maintenance cost, system availability, or reliability) under some constraints. For instance, Smidt-Destombes, Heijden, and Harten (2009) developed heuristics for a joint optimization of preventive maintenance (PM) frequency, spare part inventory levels and spare part repair capacity for a k-out-of-n system. Wang (2012), whose work is similar to Smidt–Destombes, proposed a joint optimization for inventory control of spare parts and the PM inspection interval, in which stochastic dynamic programming was employed to find the joint optimal solutions over a finite time horizon. A study by Dehayem Nodem, Kenné, and Gharbi (2011) which aimed to find the decision variables that minimize overall cost, including repair and PM costs, resulted in a method which found the optimal production, repair, and PM policies based on a semi-Markov decision process. Borrero and Akhavan-Tabatabaei (2013) formulated two analytical models based on MDPs for a single-machine, single-produce workstation subject to random failure; the purpose of these models was to obtain optimal policies using a cost function associated with three types of cost. More information on optimal maintenance strategies can be found in studies by Yeh and Lo (2001), Kyriakidis and Dimitrakos (2006), Bedford, Dewan, Meilijson, and Zitrou (2011), and Fallah-Fini, Triantis, Garza, and Seaver (2012).

From the volume of published literature, it is clear that the semi-Markov Process (SMP) is commonly used to model repairable systems in many maintenance policies (Çekyay & Özekici, 2010; Burak & Sloan, 2013), which shows that the SMP can characterize system dynamics and facilitate modeling a variety of systems well. On the other hand, many authors view the costs associated with maintenance, repair and replacement as a key factor in their work (Smith & Dekker, 1997; Jia & Wu, 2009; Zhang & Wang, 2011). However, for certain complex systems, such as space exploration and satellite systems, or complex control systems in steel or chemical plants, system reliability is much more important than upkeep costs. Under such circumstances, effort made to minimize upkeep costs may not be as relevant. Hence, situations where costs are a secondary factor are not taken into account in our study.

In addition to maintenance policies, the structure of a system has a significant effect on the system availability and reliability. Standby redundancy, as one of the important structures in reliability theory, attracts a substantial amount of interest in the field of system reliability and operational research. The common standby structures include the 2-or 3-unit standby (Subramanian & Anantharaman, 1995;Mahmoud & Moshref, 2010), the (2,
                     n
                     −2) standby (Papageorgiou & Kokolakis, 2007) and (Papageorgiou & Kokolakis, 2010), the k-out-of-N structure (Ding, Zuo, Tian, & Li, 2010;Ruiz-Castro & Li, 2011; Smidt-Destombes et al., 2009;Li & Zuo, 2008) and the M-for-N shared protection structure (Hirokazu & Atsushi, 2011). Among such structures, the 2-unit/component cold standby structure studied in this paper is a practical aspect of standby redundancy, and has been widely applied in engineering design, such as in space exploration and satellite systems (Sinaki, 1994), textile manufacturing systems (Pandey, Jacob, & Yadav, 1996), carbon recovery systems in fertilizer plants (Kumar, Kumar, & Mehta, 1996). It is worth mentioning that the issue studied in this paper comes from the practical flattener control system in a steel plant and the optimal results obtained have been applied to the PM policy of the flattener control system.

In view of the above discussion, in this paper, a novel optimal PM policy for a cold standby system with two components and a repairman is presented. In this study, a SMP and regenerative point technique was used to model the system under some reasonable assumptions and all possible states of the system and transition probabilities between them were analyzed. The optimal PM cycle was derived by maximizing the mean time from the initial state to system failure in the form of the theorem. Finally, results from a numerical example and simulation experiments, which were used to validate the effectiveness of the optimal PM policy are provided.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 the basic assumptions for system modeling are given, and all possible states of the system are determined. In Section 3, the semi-Markov kernel of the system corresponding to transition probabilities between states are further analyzed. In Section 4, the optimal PM cycle is derived by maximizing the mean time from the initial state to system failure. In Sections 5 and 6 a numerical example and simulation experiment is performed, and a conclusion with a brief summary is provided. Finally, in, Appendix A, the Proof of theorem 1 is given.

For ease of reference, some notations to be used in this paper are given as follows:

The system under consideration consists of a working component and a cold-standby spare component. It should be noted that the working and spare components are not different from each other, meaning that the two components have the same distribution of time-to-failure. In addition, the system includes a repairman who is responsible for the repair of the failed component and the PM of the working one. For simplicity, the following reasonable and necessary assumptions of the system were made.
                        Assumption 1
                        Two components are the same type so that their lifetimes are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). After repair or maintenance, both components are considered to be “as good as new”. Repair and maintenance times are arbitrary and independent. For simplicity of expression, one component is called C
                           1 and the other is called C
                           2.

Initially, the two components are both new and it is supposed that C
                           1 is in a working state and C
                           2 is in a cold standby state. If C
                           1 fails, C
                           2 begins to work instead of C
                           1 instantaneously. At this same time, the repairman begins repairing C
                           1. The time to switch from C
                           1 to C
                           2 is negligible or is not taken into account.

The failed component, after having been repaired, either begins to work or enters the cold standby state according to the state of the other component.

In order to keep components’ running properly, the working component needs to receive PM periodically at times kT(k
                           =1,2,…,
                           n) where T is a cycle length, provided that the spare component is available. If the spare component is not available, the PM is skipped until the next time for it to be done.

When the working component fails while the other is still being repaired or maintained, the system fails.

Under above assumptions, the various state of the system can be straightforwardly defined as follows:
                        
                           
                              
                              
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                       0
                                    
                                    A component works while the other is in cold standby. Both components are new at the time of entry into this state.
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                       1
                                    
                                    A component works while the other is in repair.
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                       2
                                    
                                    A component works while the other is in maintenance.
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                       3
                                    
                                    A component is in repair or maintenance while the other waits for repair or maintenance, this state represents system failure.
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  

The numbers 0, 1, or 2 denote the working state, standby state, and repair or maintenance state of the components, respectively. The system operational process is shown in Fig. 1
                     .


                     Fig. 1 is a typical scenario in which the system operational process is described as following steps. At the beginning, the system enters into S
                     0 at t
                     =0, then passes through S
                     1 and S
                     2 several times. Finally, the system fails in S
                     3 at t
                     =
                     t
                     5. For the above states of the system, S
                     0 is the initial state at which the system first enters into and cannot come back to after leaving. S
                     1 and S
                     2 are recurring states, which system passes through several times. S
                     3 is the absorption state in which system fails and stops, The system moves between states, which is referred to as “transitions” as illustrated in Fig. 2
                     . Note that not all transitions are bidirectional.


                     Fig. 2 depicts the possible one-step transitions between the states.

It can be seen that the times of entry into any state S

Next, the semi-Markov kernel of the system is analyzed. Initially, the system is in state S
                     0. If the working component fails before the PM action, i.e. X is less than X
                     
                        T
                     , then according to Assumption 2, we know that after the failure time, one component is in state 2 and the other is in state 0, which shows that the system is in S
                     1. Therefore, the state transition from S
                     0 to S
                     1 occurs at the failure time. Thus, p
                     01(t) can be expressed as:

                     However, if the working component does not fail before the PM is performed, i.e. X is greater than X
                     
                        T
                     , then the PM action will be carried out at the end of the cycle T. Meanwhile, the spare component must start working in place of the working one. In this situation, the state transition from S
                     0 to S
                     2 occurs at time T. Note that the cycle T is denoted by the random variableX

                        i1(t) is analyzed in a similar way. It is assumed that the system is in either state S
                     1 or S
                     2. In these states, in order for the system be in S
                     1 at time t, the failure of the working component must occur in the interval (0,
                     t], and the failure time must satisfy two conditions at the same time. One condition is that the failure time must be after the completion of the repair or maintenance of the other component, that is X
                     >
                     Y
                     
                        i
                     . According to Assumptions 3 and 4, after the failure time, one component is in state 0 and the other is in state 2, which shows that the system is in state S
                     1. Thus, the state transition from S
                     
                        i
                      
                     i
                     =1, 2 to S
                     1 occurs at the failure time. The other condition is that the working component must fail before the PM is performed, that is X
                     <
                     X
                     
                        T
                     , otherwise the system enters state S
                     2 from S
                     
                        i
                      
                     i
                     =1, 2 at the failure time. Thus, p
                     
                        i1(t) can be expressed as:

                     Now, we have derived all possible transition probabilities from one state to another, which is the semi-Markov kernel of the system.

From the semi-Markov kernel of the system, we see that the PM cycle T, as a random variable, is relevant to transition probabilities, so that the cycle T indirectly affects the CDF of any system state. Now, the issue in which we most interested is how the PM cycle affects the mean time to system failure. To address that issue, a novel optimal PM policy is presented and thereafter, a methodology for the policy is provided.

By taking the Laplace transform of Eqs. (3)–(7), the resulting equations are:

To evaluate the performance of our policy, simulation experiments under different parameter sets were carried out. Moreover, the results were compared with the approach of Mahmoud and Moshref (2010) under the same conditions. Note that in the approach of Mahmoud and Moshref (2010), the distributions of repair times and PM times are exponential distributions which is the same as in our policy; however, the distributions of lifetimes of the components are defined as F(t)=1−(1+
                        λ t)e
                        −λt
                        . Therefore, F(t), in simulation experiments, is rewritten as

                         to satisfy the same testing conditions. The parameter sets are shown in Table 1
                         and the results of the experiment are shown as Fig. 3
                        .

It is necessary to explicitly account for the parameters in Table 1. The parameter λ corresponds to λ
                        1 and λ
                        2, which are shape parameters. The parameter α corresponds to α
                        1 and α
                        2, which are scale parameters. The shape and scale parameters determine the failure rate of the components. The parameter μ corresponds to μ
                        1 and μ
                        2, which represent the mean repair rate. The parameter β represents the mean PM rate. Therefore, the corresponding parameters take the same value in a certain set. In Mahmoud and Moshrefs’ approach (2010), the components can suffer hardware and human error failures. The parameters μ
                        1 and μ
                        2 are mean repair rates, respectively, for hardware and human error failures. In practical complex systems, it is seldom possible that human error failure occurs. Thus, human error failures in this study are deemed as hardware failures so that the value of μ
                        2 is assigned to the same as μ
                        1, which also guarantees the same testing conditions.


                        Fig. 3 is the result of applying both our policy and the scheme of Mahmoud and Moshref (2010), respectively, which shows the variation of MTSF versus PM time T. By comparing curves depicted in Fig. 1(a)–(d), it can be seen that all the maximums of MTSF obtained by our policy are higher than Mahmoud and Moshref scheme under four sets of parameters. In particular, the maximum amount of improvement in terms of MTSF as high as 23.6% in Fig. 1(b). Hence, the proposed policy is better than the Mahmoud and Moshref scheme in terms of the maximum of MTSF.

On the other hand, Fig. 1 also reflects a certain relationship between MTSF and the parameters λ, α, μ and β. Comparing the curves between Fig. 1(a) and (b), we can conclude the following: (1) the maximum of MTSF increases with λ and α decreasing, given that μ and β are fixed (e.g. in parameter sets 1 and 2). And (2) The maximum MTSF increases with increasing μ and β, given that λ and α are fixed (e.g. in parameter sets 3 and 4).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

For a cold standby system with two components and a repairman, an optimal PM policy based on a semi-Markov process and regenerative point technique was investigated. In the policy, the optimal PM cycle is obtained in the form of a theorem by maximizing the function of mean time to system failure. The theorem illustrates that there are three kinds of results regarding the optimal PM cycle under different initial conditions. A numerical example and simulation experiments validated the effectiveness of the policy and demonstrated the influence the distribution of life of the component, repair rate and maintenance rate of an optimal PM cycle. The optimal PM policy has been applied to the maintenance action of the flattener control system, and the working time of components indeed enhanced by implementing the proposed PM policy in the shopfloor. Thus, the paper has certain practical significance to complex systems.

                        o
                     
                     <∞) satisfying Eqs. (31) and (32).

If r(0)⩾
                     k, then h(0)⩾
                     D. Thus

                                 ′
                              
                           
                           (
                           T
                           )

                           0
                        
                      for any positive T, which illustrates the optimal PM cycle T
                     
                        o
                     
                     =0 since m
                     0(T) is monotonous decreasing.

If r(∞)⩽
                     K, then h(∞)⩽
                     D, that is, h(T)<
                     D for any finite T, which illustrates the optimal PM cycle T
                     
                        o
                     
                     =∞.

On the other hand, if γ
                     1
                     η
                     1
                     <
                     γ
                     2
                     η
                     2, then h(0)<0, h′(0)<0 and h′(∞)>0. Thus h(T) is a unimodal function and monotonous increasing for any T
                     >
                     T
                     
                        o
                     ,where h′(T
                     
                        o
                     )=0. If γ
                     1
                     η
                     1 
                     =
                     γ
                     2
                     η
                     2, then h′(0)=0 and h(T) is monotonous increasing. In either case, if r(∞)>
                     K, then there exists a unique and finite T
                     
                        o
                     (0<
                     T
                     
                        o
                     
                     <∞) satisfying (31) and (32). If r(∞)⩽
                     K, then h(T)<
                     D for any T, thus the optimal PM time is T
                     
                        o
                     
                     =∞.
