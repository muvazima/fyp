                  Green supplier development focuses on helping organizations integrate activities to improve the natural environmental performance of their supply chains. These green-supplier-development programs require substantial resources and investments by a buyer company. Investigation into investment management in this context has only begun. This paper introduces a methodology to help manage investment in green-supplier-development and business-supplier-development practices. Managing these practices and their outcomes requires managing of a large sets of data. We propose a combination of rough set theoretic and fuzzy clustering means (FCM) approaches; first to simplify, and then sharpen the focus on the complex environment of evaluation of the investment decisions. The combined methodology, based on performance measures of supplier practices and agreed-upon investment objectives, identifies a set of guidelines that can help make decisions about sound investments in the supplier practices more effectively and judiciously. Various steps involved in the methodology are illustrated through using an example developed to highlight the salient steps and issues of the methodology. We show how the results may be interpreted to obtain many insights useful from both practical and research perspectives. Although the impetus to developing this methodology came from sustainability considerations, the methodology is general enough to be applicable in other areas where management and evaluation of investments is based on large data sets.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Organizations can make a broad variety of investments for greening their operations as they seek to competitively make themselves sustainable. An effective way for organizations to improve their overall sustainability is by greening their supply chains (Humphreys, Wong, & Chan, 2003). The process of developing and implementing sustainable supply chains is a complex task because it involves many interrelated supply chain activities and functions within and between organizations (Kiron et al., 2015). Suppliers may find it difficult to achieve sustainability and greening goals in a timely fashion without the help, support and cooperation of buyers (Seuring & Mueller, 2008b; Simpson & Power, 2005). It has come to light that supplier development and green supplier development programs may be the most effective way to improve supply chain sustainability (Bai & Sarkis, 2010b; Blome, Hollos, & Paulraj, 2014; Govindan, Sarkis, Jabbour, Zhu, & Geng, 2014; Vachon & Klassen, 2006). It has been noted that the most effective way to improve the sustainability and greening of the entire supply chain is to develop shared objectives and procedures for stakeholders throughout the supply chain (Grimm, Hofstetter, & Sarkis, 2014). Not only is the greening important and needed for developed countries, but for developing countries as well (Jabbour & Jabbour, 2009; Kannan, Jabbour, & Jabbour, 2014). The green supplier development not only involves the acquisition of capital expenditure items but also investments in technology, training, research and development, knowledge transfer, etc.

The complexity of such shared programs, involvement of multiple stakeholders, and the potentially large capital costs makes the investment decision – selection of the programs to invest – a multi-faceted and intricate task (Bai & Sarkis, 2014; Varsei et al., 2014). A method or technique that can identify effective green and sustainable supplier development programs and also indicate the level of effective investment is a valuable tool for organizations seeking to justify and/or prioritize such programs.

In order to help managers make decisions in this multifaceted environment, this paper introduces a novel technique, which reduces the complexity of the decision setting and simultaneously finds guidelines that identify the most effective programs given the level of investment in these programs. The method introduced here eschews a “meta-analysis” approach lest we miss some relationships helpful in identifying the investments and their influence on overall performance. Managers find it useful to have such data available in considering many conflicting issues and impacts that can result from these investment decisions.

In this paper, fuzzy cluster means (Başkır & Türkşen, 2013; Bezdek, 1981; Tan & Isa, 2011) and rough set theory (Pawlak, 1982) are introduced as complementary components in a novel methodology. First, this methodology reduces the set of all available programs to a set of potentially beneficial programs that are worthy of investment; next, it clusters these programs based on their general characteristics and then identifies how well they relate to greening performance. The model developed in this paper succeeds in reducing the complexity of the decision scenarios to make them more amenable for analysis and understanding, while minimizing information loss.

The research in this paper contributes to the literature by furthering investigation into investments for sustainability with a supply chain focus, and especially the under-explored topic of green supplier development (Bai & Sarkis, 2010b). The technique utilizes two methodologies that are rarely applied to engineering economy or investment decisions. Thus, we seek to expand the scope of the two methodologies and offer a synthesized practical example of their application.

The remainder of the paper provides some general background on the green supplier development environment and tools for investment and appraisal evaluation of green supplier development practices. Then, the two analytical approaches used for investment appraisal modeling are introduced. An illustrative, hypothetical, example is provided to build comprehension of the multi-methodology technique. Insights from the results and conclusions are presented with directions for future investigation on this topic.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

The integration of environmental sustainability practices into organizations can range from reactive activities in response to regulations to more proactive activities that include developing plans to gain competitive advantages from greener practices (Buysse & Verbeke, 2003; Wu, Jim Wu, Chen, & Goh, 2014). Within the past two decades, there has been recognition for expanding environmental sustainability management beyond the scope of a single organization to more effectively address the environmental burdens of products and processes (Sarkis, 1995). This recognition has recently appeared as a concern for many executives in a variety of organizations. For example, the UN Global Compact in a recent survey of over 800 executives found supply chain management issues one of the top barriers to the improvement of corporate sustainability (United Nations Global Compact, 2013). The interest in green supply chain management (GSCM) has seen exponential growth in the past decade for these reasons (Kiron et al., 2015). The interest in practical and theoretical GSCM has resulted in empirical studies, case analyses, theory development and mathematical and analytical modeling (Brandenburg, Govindan, Sarkis, & Seuring, 2014; Seuring & Muller, 2008b). A recent, ongoing, unpublished survey has shown sustainability in supply chains as one of the most mentioned emergent topics in supply chain management (Handfield & Wieland, 2014).

Given this wide interest in GSCM, let us start with an explanation of what is GSCM. The topic has evolved considerably over the years and has followed the major accepted terms and paths of practice and research. Environmental supply chain management, green logistics, environmental purchasing, sustainable supply chain management, have been used as alternate terms for GSCM. In fact, a review paper on defining sustainable or green supply chain management showed that over 30 definitions exist in the literature (Ahi & Searcy, 2013). The most general theme in all these definitions is that GSCM incorporates natural, environmental concerns in supply chain management. GSCM can include a broad variety of practices ranging from environmental supplier selection and development, eco-design, green marketing, environmentally conscious operations, and reverse logistics (Kannan et al., 2014; Sarkis, 2003; Sarkis, Zhu, & Lai, 2011).

An important but often neglected topic, both in practice and research literature, is the issue of green supplier development (Bai & Sarkis, 2010b). Green supplier development goes beyond just requiring supply chain partners to become greener; it involves a buyer helping its suppliers to become greener. The initiatives and investments required for green supplier development can be extensive and relatively more expensive than a typical supplier development program. Since this field and topic are relatively new and the expertise is relatively scarce for these programs and projects, the expenses can be higher. Let us consider for example, furniture manufacturer Herman Miller who was seeking to improve the designs of one of its high-end office chairs by reducing the amount of polyvinyl chlorides in the arms of the chairs. In order to implement the new design, Herman Miller needed to invest in updating of suppliers’ manufacturing processes. Just the retooling of new equipment alone for this one small component for one supplier required an investment of $200,000 (Lee & Bony, 2008); imagine the costs then, if there was the need to develop greener capabilities in many suppliers of different components for a given manufactured product. The green-supplier-development investments can reach significant fraction of the total and can easily range in tens of millions of dollars.

Not only do green-supplier-development investments and their appraisal focus on specific capital equipment investments, but may also include costs of training, knowledge sharing, and other more intangible items and risks (Dou, Zhu, & Sarkis, 2014). Green-supplier-development practices have been categorized into three groupings (Bai & Sarkis, 2010b): (1) Green knowledge transfer and communication, (2) Investment and resource transfer, and (3) Management and organizational practices. The first category may include programs such as training suppliers on the issues of environmental cost controls, providing technical expertise to suppliers, eco-design, product development training, setting environmental performance targets for suppliers, and joint and team problem solving of environmental issues. Investment and resource transfer under green-supplier-development practices may include transferring employees with environmental expertise to suppliers, rewarding suppliers for better environmental performance, and financing suppliers’ major environmental capital expenditures. The third category green management and organizational practice can comprise aspects such as requiring and aiding in acquiring ISO 14,000 certification for suppliers, setting long-term contracts that include environmental dimensions, building top management commitment for greening the supply chain, and developing a formal process for supplier development for suppliers’ suppliers.

As can be seen in Table 1
                     , green supplier development practices cover a broad range of possible activities. Since organizational resources are generally limited, identifying which practices to invest is a capital investment decision (Narasimhan, Kim, & Tan, 2008). The investment appraisal of which green-supplier-development practice to invest is an important strategic decision for the buyer firms (Dou et al., 2014; Dunn & Young, 2004; Humphreys et al., 2004).

Formal models for general green supply chain management decisions are only starting to receive increased attention from the research community (Bai, Sarkis, Wei, & Koh, 2012; Brandenburg et al., 2014; Suering & Muller, 2008a). In the GSCM literature, most analytical modeling for investment decisions has been on supplier selection (e.g. Bai & Sarkis, 2010a; Genovese, Lenny Koh, Bruno, & Esposito, 2013; Govindan, Rajendran, Sarkis, & Murugesan, 2013; Igarashi de Boer, & Fet, 2013; Jabbour & Jabbour, 2009). However, overall, green supply chain analytical modeling is still a relatively novel area of investigation (Seuring, 2013) with only about 10% of sustainable-supply-chain studies relying on analytical or decision modeling (Brandenburg et al., 2014). Most of these quantitative modeling efforts utilize the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) or linear programming optimization approaches (Seuring, 2013). Other techniques, mostly focusing on green supplier selection issues, have been proposed, but are not as well developed or advanced (Govindan et al., 2013; Seuring, 2013).

The literature on appraisal for investments in supplier development in general and green supplier development in particular is quite limited. Previous extant studies on general supplier development (e.g. Krause, Handfield, & Tyler, 2007; Sucky & Durst, 2013; Wagner, 2011) sought to determine which programs significantly contribute to general supplier development, however, most of the studies are broadly empirical, or introductory conceptual discussions. Opportunities exist for models of general and green-supplier-development-investment decisions, and these area are fertile for additional investigation (Bai & Sarkis, 2010a; Dou et al., 2014; Simatupang & Sridharan, 2004).

In one of the few formal modeling approaches investigating green-supplier-development decisions, rough set theory was used to evaluate incomplete and intangible information (Bai & Sarkis, 2010b). That specific model has limited scope because it did not focus on managerial decisions nor did it focus on investment appraisal. It was developed and applied only for formal evaluation of the effectiveness of green supplier development programs. One other recent study, noting the gap in this field, investigates supplier development using AHP as its foundation (Dou et al., 2014). Although useful, AHP has a number of limitations, including the need to have decision makers and analysts closely involved in acquisition of data, the use of relatively subjective data, and theoretical/mathematical concerns such as rank-reversal.

Surprisingly, given the many quantitative decision tools and techniques that exist ranging from simple scoring and matrix methods to more advanced mathematical programming, none have sought to further investigate application for green-supplier-development-programs investment. To build on the previous research and fill in the aforementioned gap, we introduce an extension of the application of rough set theory, incorporating its use with fuzzy clustering means for investment appraisal and evaluation of green-supplier-development practices. The technique utilizes the advantages of both approaches to guide managers in these investment-ranking decisions. In the next section, we provide some background on these approaches to set the stage for introducing the methodology with an illustrative application.

To introduce the proposed investment decision methodology, we first provide some general background and notation needed for the rough set and fuzzy clustering means (FCM) methods. We then describe the methodology by concurrently offering an illustrative application of investment decision for sustainable supplier development.

Rough set theory (Pawlak, 1982) has been applied as a data mining technique to help evaluate large sets of data. It is a non-parametric method that can classify objects that are indistinguishable with respect to previous occurrences and knowledge into sets containing similar objects. It has been utilized for sustainable supply chain and operations management concerns (Bai & Sarkis, 2010a, 2010b). The results of rough set techniques, provided as various rules and decision trees, offer many options to the decision maker and thus provide flexibility for implementation (Bai & Sarkis, 2010b). In the methodology presented here we utilize rough set techniques that can be integrated into a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach, with specific emphasis on investment management of sustainable supplier development. We now present some definitions to help set the foundation for the rough set approach.

                           Let U be a nonempty finite universe of objects, and let R be an equivalence relation between objects in U. Thus, the equivalence relation R can be defined that two objects are equivalent if and only if they have the same value for every attribute based on a set of attributes (Pawlak, 1991). The equivalence class containing an object x is defined by

Lower approximations describe the domain objects which definitely belong to the subset of interest. Upper approximations describe objects which may possibly belong to the subset of interest. Approximation vagueness is usually defined by precise values of lower and upper approximations. The difference between the upper and the lower approximations constitutes a boundary region for the vague (rough) set. Hence, rough set theory expresses vagueness by employing a boundary region of a set. If the boundary region of a set is empty it means (BNR
                        (X)= ∅) and that the set is crisp, otherwise the set is rough (inexact). In many real world applications, the boundary regions are not usually crisp. BNR
                        (X)> ∅ provides us with a rough set for our evaluation.

                               is the information entropy of attribute set C which does not contain attribute c. The above expression identifies the difference between the information entropy and the information entropy of the reduced set that does not include attribute c. This information significance function can be used to measure the significance of conditional attributes and will help to reduce the number of practices and organizational characteristic attributes to be considered and only keep those conditional attributes that provide strong evidence and relationships with the performance outcomes.

Given that rough set theory cannot directly handle continuous numerical data; FCM can be used to discretize such data, making the data amenable to rough set theory (Hu, Xie, & Yu, 2007) and our methodology applicable. FCM uses clustering, which is a technique to generate groups of subsets of data so that objects in each cluster are more similar to each other than objects from different clusters (Ghorbani, 2005; Hartigan, 1975; Izakian & Abraham, 2011). One problem of applying traditional (hard) clustering techniques is that there are only two discrete values, one or zero, to indicate if a data point belongs to a unique cluster or not. Hard clustering requires well-defined boundaries between clusters, which is not the characteristic of most real world applications (Damaskopoulos, Vitkauskaitė, & Gatautis, 2008; Gumilar, Zarnić, & Selih, 2011).

In real world situations, events or objects can be represented as data objects in multi-dimensional space. Fuzzy theory introduced by Zadeh (1965) provides a mechanism to represent and manipulate uncertainty and ambiguity in multi-criteria data objects. The best known of the fuzzy clustering methods is the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm (Bezdek, 1981). The FCM algorithm classifies the data objects by grouping similar objects into clusters (Başkır & Türkşen, 2013; Tan & Isa, 2011). Thus, objects in one cluster are more dissimilar when compared to objects in another cluster. This clustering of data objects is achieved by iteratively minimizing an objective function that is a function of the sum of distances between the objects in a cluster and the center of that cluster, for all clusters. The degree of membership in the fuzzy clusters depends on the closeness of the data objects to the cluster centers and is quantified by a value in the interval [0, 1]. A higher degree of membership value represents greater association between that object and a particular cluster centroid. FCM clustering has been widely applied to feature analysis, clustering, and classifier designs in fields such as geology, medical imaging, target recognition, image segmentation, and performance evaluation (Bai, Dhavale, & Sarkis, 2014).

The FCM algorithm assigns objects to each category by using fuzzy memberships. It partitions a set of n objects

After FCM clustering, each object has a membership value for each cluster. These membership values are in the range [0, 1] and indicate the association strength between the object and a particular cluster. By assigning each object to the cluster with the highest membership value, the clustering of the objects is obtained.

Given the definitions and expressions in the previous section of the rough set and FCM characteristics, we now apply them in a multistage methodology using an illustrative application. There are 3 stages and 6 steps in the methodology to evaluate investment practices of green-supplier-development programs. The goal of the methodology is to identify the type and level of environmental, business, and organizational characteristics factors that come into play in an investment in green-supplier-development programs. Further details such as number of suppliers, types of programs or practices, and performance results of the illustrative application are defined below.

Let us first define the decision table (an information system) for green (environmental) supplier-development-practices-investment evaluation. The table is defined by T = (U, C, V, D, W, f
                     v, f
                     w,), where U = {S
                     1, S
                     2,…, S
                        m
                     } is a set of m suppliers who are part of the supplier development program for a given buyer. C = {c
                     1, c
                     2,…, cn
                     } is a set of n environmental- and business-supplier-development programs or practices, and organizational characteristics (also called conditional attributes) for each supplier. D = { D 
                     1, D 
                     2,…D k
                     ) is a set of k decision outcomes or decision attributes representing the performance outcomes as defined by the buyer. The functions f
                     v and f
                     w are used to define the set of values V and W for each conditional and decision variable respectively.

For our illustrative case, let U = {Si, i = 1, 2, … ,30} (i.e. 30 suppliers) with fifteen conditional attributes C = {c
                     j
                     , j = 1, 2, 3,…,15} each. The conditional attributes include various green (environmental), business and organizational supplier-development practices. We assume there are six environmental practices E1,…,E6, six business practices B1,…,B6, and three organizational characteristics O1, O2 and O3. The environmental-supplier-development practices may be selected from the list in Table 1. Business practices for supplier programs may include such characteristics as cost, delivery reliability, delivery speed, flexibility in meeting volume requirements, or other traditional business-supplier-development practices (e.g. see Krause et al., 2007; Sarkis & Talluri, 2002 for additional categories and examples).

The company can evaluate the impact of its investment in supply chain on many different performance measures. Some of these performance measures (also referred to as decision attributes) may be based on financial measures others may be based on environmental or social responsibility considerations. Our illustrative case has only two sets of decision attributes D1 and D2. D1 and D2 are, respectively, environmentally-oriented and business-oriented performance measures. The values of these performance measures for each supplier are determined by buyer's management personnel who have in-depth exposure and access to the supplier-development programs and practices. The performance measure D1 for example indicates how well each supplier has contributed in attainment of the company's environmental goals. Table 2
                      shows the data (information system) developed for the illustrative case. We now present the series of steps required to complete the combined rough set and fuzzy clustering mean analysis and concurrently apply those steps to the illustrative case.


                     Fig. 1
                      provides a schematic diagram of our methodology encompassing the Rough Set and FCM procedures and how they are combined to extract the information needed for the decision makers. Please note there are three stages in our procedure and each stage has steps which are numbered consecutively across the stages to provide a unique number for each step. Fig. 1 may be consulted for a visual depiction of the sequence of steps described in the following methodology.


                     Stage 1: Determine key environmental and business supplier development practices and organizational characteristics
                  

In this stage we focus on the use of rough set theory to identify the reduced, key, set of environmental and business supplier-development practices and organizational characteristics according to supplier performance outcomes (decision attributes) to remove superfluous or less influential attributes from the information systems.


                     Step 1: Develop the information system table
                  

In the illustrative case, the environmental and business supplier development practices and buyer's investment in them can be grouped into ranges based on relative investment. These values may also be estimated on an ordinal scale by management personnel based on actual historical data, or anecdotal exposure and perception. Business practices for supplier-development programs may include such characteristics as improving cost, delivery reliability, delivery speed, flexibility in meeting volume requirements, etc. Environmental practices can be the amount of waste generated by the supplier programs, greenhouse gas emissions, or a number of other environmental practices. Even though we have two major program groupings, environmental and business, each of them can be further disaggregated into more specific practice measures. In our case, there are six categories each of the above two programs (E1–E6 and B1–B6). They are scored on the following ascending scale, based on buyer and suppliers’ investments. The numerical value used for an attribute in the FCM algorithm is shown in a square bracket: No Investment (NI), [1]; Low Investment (LI), [2]; Moderate Investment (MI), [3]; High Investment (HI), [4]; Full or Very High Investment (FI), [5].

The data in Table 2, used in the illustrative case, is developed by the authors for explanatory purposes. For example, a high amount of monetary investment by the buyer and its supplier in an environmental supplier practice (E1) for the first supplier (Supplier 01) has been assigned a value of HI (i.e.
                        
                           f
                           (
                           01
                           ,
                           E
                           1
                           )
                           =
                           HI
                        
                     ).

The three organizational characteristic variables (O1–O3) have three levels each. In our case, O1 represents organizational size, O2 to represents profitability of organization, and O3 represents organizational learning ability. We use ordinal ascending scales as shown below:

Size of the organization: (O1), 3 levels: Small (S), [1]; Medium (M), [2]; Large (L), [3]. Profitability: (O2), and Learning Ability: (O3), three separate levels each: Low (L), [1]; Moderate (M), [2]; High (H), [3]. It may be noted that (L) indicates a superlative characteristic in the O1 category whereas diminutive one in O2 and O3. The decision attributes or performance measures, D1 and D2, are also assigned the following three levels: Low performance (L), [1]; Moderate Performance (M), [2]; High Performance (H), [3]. They are placed in the last two columns of Table 2. Discrete measures of performance are needed for discriminatory capabilities of our methodology.


                     Step 2: Reduce attributes and form core attribute set.
                  

To form the core attribute set, the information entropy for the conditional attributes (C), will be determined using the expression (6). In this illustrative case, the conditional attributes for individual categories (business-supplier-development practices, environmental-supplier-development practices or organizational characteristics) are separately reduced. Let I(C) be represented asI(B)for the information entropy of business-supplier-development practices,I(E) for the information entropy of environmental-supplier-development practices, and I(O)for the information entropy of organizational characteristics.

In our illustrative example, |U| is the cardinality of the universe of 30 suppliers. |Xi
                     | is the number of suppliers with similar conditional attributes levels (i.e. investment levels) as a supplier i. Supplier 03 is in the same environmental-development-practices-investment level as supplier 18 and supplier 27, thus |X
                     03| = |X
                     18| = |X
                     27| = 3. To conserve space similar calculations for the business and organizational characteristic categories are not displayed. Thus, the environmental category information entropy for the original, full set of environmental-supplier-development practices is:

                                 −
                                 
                                    58
                                    900
                                 
                                 
                                 =
                                 
                                 0.9356
                                 .
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  

Second, identify the information significance of each of the attribute sets (business-supplier-development practices, environmental-supplier-development practices or organizational characteristics).

For example, using expression (6) we calculate 
                        
                           I
                           (
                           E
                           −
                           E
                           1
                           )
                        
                      = 0.9356. Thus, Sig
                     (E)(E1) = 0.9356 −0.9356 = 0. The environmental-supplier-development practices that provide significant, meaning non-zero, values are practices E2, E3, E4 and E5 with significance values of 0.0067, 0.0045, 0.0023, and 0.0023, respectively.

Third, remove attributes that do not contribute information to the decision-making; form an initial set, core(C), made up of only the conditional attributes with non-zero significance values.

                        
                           (14)
                           
                              
                                 c
                                 o
                                 r
                                 e
                                 
                                    (
                                    C
                                    )
                                    =
                                    {
                                 
                                 c
                                 ∈
                                 C
                                 
                                    |
                                    Si
                                 
                                 
                                    g
                                    C
                                 
                                 (
                                 c
                                 
                                    )
                                    >
                                    0
                                    }
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  

Fourth, the final reduced core attribute matrix must satisfy the condition of I(core(C)) = I(C). If it does not, then one of the attributes that was removed is added back into the core set and the new core set's information entropy is calculated; the procedure is repeated until meeting the condition I(core(C)) = I(C). Once the condition is met, we can form the final reduced core attribute matrix shown in Table 3.
                     
                  

For example, the environmental practices category information entropy of the core set (I(core(E)) is compared with the information entropy of the original environmental category conditional attribute set (I(E)). To calculate I(core(E)), expression (6) is used and only includes conditional attributes E2, E3, E4 and E5. We find that I(core(E)) = 0.9356 = I(E) = 0.9356. The reduced set of business practices and organizational characteristic categories will be similarly, separately calculated to form the reduced core attribute set shown in Table 3.
                  


                     Stage 2: Clustering objects by the fuzzy c-means algorithm for each category
                  

In this stage, the FCM approach is used to perform the segmentation of the 30 suppliers for each different conditional attribute category.


                     Step 3: Set parameters for FCM
                  

The FCM algorithm requires two important user inputs; information about c (the number of clusters) and m (the order of fuzziness). Selecting suitable (c*, m*) pairs is a challenge because of the unanticipated behavior of the FCM algorithm that can occur. These initialization difficulties impact cluster quality. While the difficulty of deciding the number of clusters could affect the area of cluster coverage and fuzziness of cluster boundaries, the difficulty of obtaining the initial cluster centroids could affect the cluster compactness and classification accuracy. There are many different validity indexes for choosing the number of clusters (c) and the order of fuzziness (m) in the conventional FCM.

For the illustrative case, we assign initial values for the clusters (c) to be 4 for each category and the order of fuzziness (m) to be 2.


                     Step 4: Compute cluster centers and membership value by fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm
                  

In this step, we assign suppliers to each category by using the fuzzy memberships of FCM algorithm. This step is completed by utilizing the expressions (8)–(13).

For the case example, 4 cluster centers or centroids for each area, 
                        
                           H
                           =
                           {
                           
                              h
                              1
                           
                           ,
                           
                              h
                              2
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              h
                              c
                           
                           }
                        
                     , for c= 4, are found. Clusters are based on the reduced set of supplier-development-practices levels of investment and organizational characteristics. After FCM clustering, each supplier will be associated with a membership value uik
                      for each cluster as displayed in Table 4
                     . These degrees of membership have values in the range [0, 1]. Higher values indicate greater strength of the association between that object and a particular cluster.


                     Step 5: Cluster suppliers by membership value
                  

A supplier is assigned to a cluster for which it has the highest membership value in Table 4. In the illustrative case, for example the membership value of Supplier 01 for the four E_clusters are 71.90%, 12.30%, 8.30% and 7.60% respectively; thus Supplier 01 is best assigned to E_Cluster1. Table 5
                      shows cluster results for all suppliers and attributes. Supplier 01 is in the environmental cluster 1, business cluster 1 and organizational characteristics cluster 1. This information from across all 30 suppliers will be used to generate ‘rules’ that will include the clusters and levels of investments for given organizational characteristics. These rules will help determine where to invest various resources and the characteristics of the suppliers for these resources.


                     Stage 3: formation of rules between clustering result and decision attributes
                  

In this stage we take the clustering result of the previous steps and relate them to the two decision attributes (or performance measures) D1 and D2 through a series of rules developed to discern the intrinsic relationships. To complete this step, expressions 15–19 shown in the following step are used.


                     Step 6: Form the discernible relationship matrix
                  

For rough set approaches, any decision table may be regarded as a set of generalized decision rules of the form:

                                 ,
                                 w
                                 ∈

                                 ,
                                 D

                     where ∧(g, v) is called the condition or premise; in our illustrative example it is the clustering result for the environmental-practices cluster, the business-practices cluster and the organizational-characteristics cluster. The decision or conclusion is represented by ∨(D, w), which in our illustrative example is a decision attribute. The ∧,∨are Boolean notations for “and” and “or” respectively. Indices v, wrepresent the values (belonging to the sets V and W) for each clustering result g and decision variable D, respectively (Yao & Zhao, 2008).

As an example of a decision rule let us consider (E_Cluster1) ∧ (O_Cluster1) → (D, H). This rule indicates that if a supplier belongs to environmental cluster 1 and organizational cluster 1, then this supplier's performance will rank in the high category. In our model, such rules are derived from existing, available data and are used to guide organizations to invest in the most rewarding supplier-development practices.

A number of steps are needed to determine the rules. First, we need to determine a binary indiscernible relation SIM(G). This relation describes a binary relationship between two elements in the set U.

                     where Vg
                     (x) is the value of clustering result g for supplier x.

Based on the results displayed in Table 5, we set up a binary, indiscernible relationship matrix shown in Table 6
                     . The matrix indicates the suppliers who are in the same clusters. Since

                           g

                           G
                           ,
                           
                              V
                              g

                              x
                              )
                           
                           =

                     , all the main diagonal elements of this matrix are equal to one. In addition, our results, for example, show that Supplier 01, Supplier 09, Supplier 14, and Supplier 22 belong to the same groupings in business-practices, environmental-practices and organizational-characteristic clusters. Hence Table 6, which shows the relationship matrix, has the binary relationship is set equal to “1” between Supplier 01, Supplier 09, Supplier 14, and Supplier 22.

We define an indiscernible set SG
                     (x), which is the maximal set of objects belonging to set U that are indiscernible from x based on cluster result G.

                                       )

                     In other words, SG
                     (x) represents a maximal set of suppliers that are undistinguishable from Supplier x when the clustering result G is considered.

To illustrate this concept using our example, recall that we already know one such set: {Supplier 01, Supplier 09, Supplier 14, and Supplier 22}. The other sets with binary indiscernible relationship are identified from the matrix in Table 6. The complete indiscernible set for the illustrative example is: [{Supplier 01, Supplier 09, Supplier 14, Supplier 22}, {Supplier 04, Supplier 19, Supplier 21}, {Supplier 05, Supplier 30}, {Supplier 15, Supplier 26, Supplier 27}, {Supplier 20, Supplier 28}].

The Table 5 shows the clusters to which suppliers belong based on application of FCM algorithm. To accommodate the needs of our methodology, this information needs to be restructured; it is shown in Table 7
                     . In that table, the suppliers that belong to the same clusters of environmental and business supplier-development practices and organizational characteristics are grouped together as belonging to the same type. For example, Table 5 shows that Supplier04, Supplier19 and Supplier21 belong to environmental cluster 4, business cluster 1, and organizational cluster 2. Thus these suppliers are considered of the same type (Type20) in Table 7. Since there are 4 clusters of each environmental, business and organizational practices, the number of possible supplier types is 4 × 4 × 4 = 64. Our illustrative problem has only 30 suppliers and in some situations more than one of them belong to the same type. Table 7 shows 21 distinct types (out of possible 64) to which 30 suppliers belong. Furthermore, it may be noted that in some instances the D1 decision attribute of the suppliers belonging to the same type may be different as in Type20 and Type21. It will be important to keep the difference between suppliers (as in Table 5) and supplier types (as in Table 7) in mind in the following discussion.

Now we form a matrix titled the discernibility matrix whose elements are defined as follows:

                     where an element of αG
                     (x, y) is a set of different clustering results between supplier type x and supplier type y. This element is also an element of the indiscernible set of supplier y (see Eq. 17). D(x) is the value of decision attribute D for supplier x. In other words, an element of the discernibility matrix is the set of all clustering results that discern supplier types x and y and at the same time do not have the same decision attribute D1. If the decision attribute D1 is the same for two supplier types then the corresponding matrix element is a null set as defined by expression (18). A similar analysis may be completed with decision attribute D2. To avoid repetition and save space, we only focus on the D1 in this paper.

This discernibility matrix has dimensions of 21 × 21 since there are 21 distinct supplier types in the illustrative problem (see Table 7). In the following paragraph, we describe how some elements of the matrix are obtained. Table 8
                      shows the first column of the matrix.

As an example, let us look at the relationship between Type 01 and Type 02; this will form an element. To find this element, let us first find from Table 7 the suppliers that belong to Supplier-type01 (Suppliers01, 09 and 14) and Supplier-type02 (Supplier02 only). Now let us take a look at Supplier01 and 02 rows in Table 5. Note that both these suppliers belong to Business_Cluster1, but Supplier01 belongs to E_Cluster1 and O_Cluster1 whereas Supplier02 (from Supplier-type02) does not. Since this column notes variations of Supplier01 (it is the first column in the matrix), the element is written as (E_Cluster1∨O_Cluster1).

For another example, let us look at the Type 01 and Type 07 relationship. The two supplier types have similar performance level (H) on the decision attribute D1. Thus by definition entry is written as a null set, 
                        ⌀
                     , instead of (B_Cluster1 ∨ O_Cluster1). This is because we want to find rules, which are used to distinguish between different performance levels; thus the suppliers with same performance level need not be compared with each other. When the performance levels are different then we compare each of those Types with Type01, and determine varying levels of cluster involvement with Type01, which is shown in the Table 8. Table 8 shows only the first column corresponding to Type01. The complete matrix is obtained to provide the rules, which are described below. They provide insight into expected performance outcome for levels of investments in environmental-, business-, and organizational-supplier-development practices.


                     Step 7: Form the decision rules
                  

We now are now in a position to derive the discernibility rules (functions) ΔD
                     (x), which is a discernibility rule for an object (supplier) x in a decision table D if and only if

As can be seen, expression (21) has three separate rules: (E_Cluster1 ∧ O_Cluster1), (E_Cluster1 ∧ B_Cluster1), and (B_Cluster1 ∧ O_Cluster1) for Supplier Type01 and for decision attribute D1. A similar analysis is completed for Supplier Type 02 to 21 for D1. The list of rules found and the number of times they occurred are summarized in Table 9
                     . A Similar analysis is repeated for all supplier types but with decision attribute D2, the results of which are also presented in Table 9.
                  


                     Table 9 has the complete set of rules (based on the illustrative data from Table 2) for a company interested in investing in supplier development pertaining to environmental, business practices and whose effectiveness is measured either on environmental performance metric , Δ
                     D1, and business performance metric, Δ
                     D2. For example, the rule that appears first in the table, (E = 1) & (O = 1), which is same as (E_Cluster1 ∧ O_Cluster1), states that if suppliers belong to E_Cluster1 based on investment in environmental practices and also to O_Cluster1 based on organizational characteristics then they are expected to have high environmental performance. This is a relatively strong rule because it occurs in five instances. Interestingly enough for the illustrative problem, this rule is also equally dominant for business performance as can be seen under the column headed in the table. For the illustrative problem, two other rules that equally do well for both performance measures are (E = 1) & (B = 1) and (B = 1) & (O = 1). All these rules are bolded in the table for a quick reference. Based on the information in the table, the following generalization can be made: the suppliers who belong to E_Cluster1, B_Cluster1 and O_Cluster1 exhibit the highest level of performance under both the environmental and business performance metrics. Thus the buyer organization should identify the environmental- and business-supplier-development investments that it has made with these suppliers as desirable and beneficial set of investments. Furthermore, the organizational characteristics of these suppliers should be also taken into consideration for future investments. We summarize this information in Table 10
                      in the next section.

A summary of analysis of the clusters and rules can provide insights into the investment strategies for environmental and business supplier development. The results in Table 9 show that there are other possible investment strategies other than the three mentioned earlier that can result in good, if not the best, performance. On the other hand, the table also lists some practices that generate poor performance.

A buyer organization may not be able to adopt all best green- and business-supplier-development-investment practices simultaneously; it may have to pick and choose the strategies due to resource limitations and other enterprise obligations and restrictions. It should also determine if the recommended strategies would work within its business and community environment. Hence, it would be helpful to decision makers to delineate the relationship between investment strategy and performance. Table 10, generated from the results in Table 9, provides the information needed with that objective in mind.


                     Table 10 provides an index associated with the number of occurrences in rules for each cluster for the two performance attributes D1, the environment, and D2, the business. One of the clusters, E_Cluster1, has appeared 11 times as part of the rules that show high environmental performance and it also appears 10 times for high business performance. This fact indicates that E_Cluster1 and high environmental and high business performance have a very strong relationship. Another cluster that has similar high performance in both areas is B_cluster1 with 8 and 9 occurrences in the two respective areas. We can also identify the clusters that indicate poor performance. The worst performing cluster for both performance perspectives is B_Cluster4 with E_Cluster4 close behind. The cluster O_Cluster1 identifies organizational characteristics most helpful in high performance under both environmental and business measures since it occurs 12 and 9 times respectively. A decision maker also can obtain information about clusters that are mediocre with respect to performance from this table.

To describe our progress so far, we started with Table 2, which has the raw data about the level of investment by the buyer organization and its suppliers in various supplier development and improvement opportunities. These opportunities were grouped under two categories, investments in green or environmental practices and business practices. The table also has data on evaluation of each supplier carried out by the personnel of the buyer organization on two metrics, the performance of the supplier based environmental performance and business performance. In the next step, using the rough set theory we reduced the number of investment options the decision maker may need to consider without losing any information valuable to making decisions. The reduced set of investment options are in Table 3. In the next step, we use FCM algorithm to form clusters of suppliers based on similarities in their level of investments in supplier development practices as shown in Table 4. Each supplier is then assigned most likely clusters based on the highest degree of membership. The cluster membership for each supplier is detailed in Table 5. Using Tables 6 and 7 we regroup the suppliers into Types where all suppliers who have the similar cluster membership in environmental, business and organizational characteristics are put in into one type. The ‘type’ may be viewed as higher level of clusters compared to the clusters obtained using FCM in Table 5. Then we apply the rough set decision rule to discernibility matrix obtained from Table 7. In Table 8 we show just the first column of such a matrix for environmental performance. The actual rules developed from the discernibility matrix are in Table 9 and summary of their frequency of occurrence is in Table 10. Now we describe how the summary can be used by the decision makers to develop courses of actions.

At this point, we are able to identify the environmental and business supplier development practices that are most beneficial, as well as determine the organizational characteristics of suppliers that are most useful in superior performance. Table 11
                      provides the final centroid values and interpretation. These centroids were used in the final iteration of the FCM in forming the clusters. It may be recalled that E_Cluster1 was identified as being associated with high performance for both environmental and business perspectives.


                     Table 11 indicates that this cluster centroid has co-ordinates of E2 = 4.78, E3 = 2.86, E4 = 2.72, and E5 = 4.06 (on a scale of 1–5). This information indicates to us that supplier who belonged to this cluster had high investments in green-supplier-development practices E2 and E5 and comparatively lower investments in the E3 and E4 green-supplier-development practices. The advice, in this case, to the decision makers would be to increase the investment in E2 and E5 and lessen the emphasis on investments in E3 and E4. The other cluster that was identified as equally important in our decision rules is B_Cluster1 (see Table 10). Based on centroid values, the decision makers are advised to emphasize investment in business supplier development practice B2 to obtain higher returns under both performance metrics. This result implies that the technique may find that some business oriented practices can contribute to environmental performance in addition to business performance.

As far as the organizational characteristics are concerned, the highest performance is associated with characteristic O1, the size of the organization. This result can be analyzed as larger-sized organizations providing superior performance under both measures. The other two characteristics are not too far behind since centroid values for O_Cluster1 are O1 = 2.08, O2 = 1.96, and O3 = 1.92 (on a scale of 1–3)

Overall, the data in our hypothetical example suggest that buyers that focus on investments in E2 and E5 green-supplier-development practices and on B2 business-oriented-supplier-development practices can achieve greater environmental and business performance outcomes. It is also found that large suppliers with high profitability and high learning ability tend to have high environmental and business performance.

In addition to the guidance on investment in supplier development practices contained in the above sections, there are both research and practical insights that can be gained from each step of the methodology. Those insights are discussed below.


                     Stage 1: identification of key investment practices for each category: In this stage, we determine green-supplier-development practices, which are not needed for further consideration. It is noted that environmental- and business-supplier-development-practices E1, E6, B3 and B4, may not be useful investments since they are redundant in achieving environmental performance results. For operating purposes, organizations should evaluate why these practices overlap other practices and whether it is appropriate to reduce investment in these areas. From a research or theoretical perspective, those practices could be eliminated from research models. The process of first developing a reduced set of practices may provide ways for organizations to save money, while still generating good environmental and business performance from its suppliers. This stage can help companies to focus on rewarding practices, and avoid practices that should not be considered for investment purposes.

Supplier-development practices can also be ranked according to the information significance based on investment levels. Organizations may gain a deeper understanding of investment practices. In our illustrative example, it was found that all organizational characteristics (O1–O3) play a useful role in identifying good performance.


                     Stage 2: clustering objects for each category: After the attribute reduction process was completed, four practices were eliminated as redundant and the remaining eight practices and three organizational characteristics provided useful information on performance. If the rough set approach alone is used to find the decision rules, without the FCM clustering stage, thousands of rules will be generated. Such a large set of rules means so much information with limited human means to process; it presents a confusing and conflicting picture for organizations as well as researchers. Clear actionable guidance would be elusive or absent. Clustering objects for each category by FCM not only reduces the number of rules, but helps to identify clearly groups and levels of the investments to pursue. The clustering results show that organizations do not simultaneously focus on all investments due to the limited resources. This finding also explains and highlights the significance of this study.

A serendipitous advantage of the combination of the two techniques is that the rough set theory cannot directly handle continuous data but FCM can be used in discretizing continuous numerical data to make it amenable for rough set methodology (Hu et al., 2007).


                     Stage 3: rules between clustering result and decision attributes: For the illustrative example, the rules relating the clustering result and the environmental performance or the business performance provide some insights and managerial implications into various green-supplier-development investment and the performance outcomes. Organizations should pay attention to two sets of rules about how to achieve good performance from the investments. First, the number of occurrences (Table 10) will help guide the decision maker to focus only on rules that provide strong evidence of correlation with the performance outcomes. Second, we found three rules, shown in bold in the Table 9, which also appear as high-frequency rules in Table 10. For our illustrative example, they provide a ‘win–win’ situation for both, the environmental and business performances.

Decision makers can gain by considering the other side of the coin, by examining the rules that would lead to a supplier's poor performance in return on investment and to help the supplier steer clear of the risks. We found B_Cluster4 has a high correlation to the poor environmental and business performance; in our illustrative example, it generated 3 and 6 observations, respectively. This indicates that suppliers should be concerned about investing in practice B6. This occurrence indicates that not all investments considered beneficial to business aspects improve business performance, and clearly implies that organizations can expect superior performance if they are careful in selecting the investments in supplier-development practices.

Green (environmental) supplier development programs are achieving greater importance as organizations respond to various competitive and regulatory pressures. These programs require substantive investments. Rigorous and careful analysis of investment in supplier development programs would lead to improved environmental and business performance. Since there are operational and strategic considerations, investment techniques and models will require reassessment over time. The complexities of such decisions begin to increase as both inter-organizational business requirements and sustainability issues arise. In this paper a novel methodology was introduced that included both rough set theory and FCM to help organizations make thorough and rigorous investment analysis and decisions.

An illustrative example was introduced that focused on utilizing an information system table that was based on investments in various green-supply-chain-development and business-supply-chain-development practices for various suppliers. Organizational characteristics and outcome performance values from these investments were also part of the information system table. In such situations the number of practices, programs, and suppliers involved could be quite extensive. To help understand and manage the investments in these programs, rough set was used to help reduce the investment alternatives and thus the complexity by identifying the most information-rich dimensions. Even after the initial simplification with rough set, the number of rules and complexity of relationships can still be formidable. Thus, a clustering approach, in our case FCM, is utilized to further reduce the ‘rules’ that are generated for investment decisions.

This paper represents the first time that rough set is used with a clustering approach that will eventually lead to simplified rules development. Thus, the contribution of this paper is not only the application of these techniques to a sustainability investment situation in a supply chain context, but also in the innovation of integrating the tools for a more complete and rigorous approach for analysts.

Although the results can be interpreted from a managerial perspective, the methodology and its outcomes can also be used for research purposes. Using data from various investments, relationships between attributes and outcomes can be used to generate hypotheses of relationships that can be investigated in broader studies. The methodology can be used for general multiple-criteria decision making as well. All these areas are fruitful for future development and research.

The methodology and this study are not without limitations. In the paper, a hypothetical illustrative example was presented. Applying the methodology to a practical situation with actual data would help in understanding the feasibility of the methodology. Although there is significant flexibility with the methodology, the factors utilized, incomplete data, analysts’ understanding, and application idiosyncrasies can all influence the effectiveness of the methodology. With adoption of enterprise resource planning software by many companies, the collection and managing large amount of data will not be a significant issue in application of methodology proposed in this paper.

This paper uses FCM as the clustering approach, whether other clustering approaches would be more appropriate or provide different insights can be investigated. FCM may be sensitive to the parameters selected; further investigation on the most appropriate parameters and their sensitivity will be required.

Overall, there are many opportunities for further investigation of the technique and the green-supplier-development investment environment. This paper sets the foundation for additional research and application in a number of directions. We look forward to pursuing and supporting these investigations.
