                  Products are often demanded in tandem because of the cross-selling effect. The demand for an item can increase if sales of its cross-selling-associated items are achieved or decrease when the associated items are out of stock, resulting in lost sales. Therefore, a joint inventory policy should be pursued in a cross-selling system. This paper introduces customer-driven cross-selling into centralized and competitive newsvendor (NV) models by representing an item’s effective demand as a function of other items’ order quantities. We derive first-order optimality conditions for the centralized model in addition to pure-strategy Nash equilibrium conditions and uniqueness conditions of the equilibria for the competitive model. We further develop gradient-based (GB) and iteration-based (IB) algorithms to solve the centralized and competitive models, respectively. A computational study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The computational results show that a larger cross-selling effect leads to a larger order quantity in a centralized NV model but a smaller order quantity in a competitive NV model, and a larger positive correlation between items’ demands leads to higher profits with smaller order quantities in both models. Moreover, NVs will order more items if the demand variance is greater, however resulting in lower profits. In a competitive situation, one will prefer smaller order quantities than in a centralized decision situation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The classical newsvendor (NV) model is a single-period problem that maximizes the expected profit under stochastic demand by determining a product’s optimal order quantity. The NV model typically assumes that inventory remaining at the end of a planning period can be disposed of at a price lower than the unit purchasing cost. In recent decades, the academic literature on single-period inventory management has been replete with newsvendor problems, although new models continue to emerge. A comprehensive review of newsvendor research prior to 1999 is available in Khouja (1999), and a recent review that extends the work of Khouja (1999) by considering several specific extensions can be found in Qin, Wang, Vakharia, Chen, and Seref (2011).

There are two types of models that extend the classical NV model to analyze multi-item inventory systems. One is a NV model with constraints, e.g., storage, budget, or weight constraints, integrating multiple items together for a joint decision (Abdel-Malek & Montanari, 2005a, 2005b; Chen & Chen, 2010; Khouja & Mehrez, 1996). The other type of model considers the demand relationships between items. One of the most popular topics is the newsvendor problem with substitutions. However, cross-selling was rarely introduced into newsvendor formulations, even though it creates an important mutual relationship between items. This paper investigates the newsvendor problem by introducing cross-selling into multi-item NV models. As an initial comparison, we briefly review the NV model with substitutions.

An unsatisfied customer may select another product that is similar to the original choice in function, color, style, size, or price as a substitute. Assuming that each item is a substitute for another item, Parlar and Goyal (1984) proposed a two-item newsboy model. Khouja, Mehrez, and Rabinowitz (1996) developed the lower and upper bounds of order quantities for a two-item NV model and presented a numerical algorithm employing a Monte Carlo simulation. Rajaram and Tang (2001) proposed a service rate heuristic for solving the centralized NV model with normally distributed demand for substitutable items. Parlar (1988) extended the problem to consider the competitive situation and proposed a two-item competitive model with substitutions. Lippman and McCardle (1997) further developed the multi-item competitive NV model with substitutions and proved the existence of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Netessine and Rudi (2003) derived first-order conditions for both the multi-item centralized and competitive NV models with demand substitutions and proved the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. Huang, Zhou, and Zhao (2011) reinvestigated the competitive NV model with demand substitutions by considering the shortage penalty cost and proposed an iterative algorithm. For more extensive literature related to this topic, please see Bitran and Dasu (1992), Bassok, Anupindi, and Akella (1999), Smith and Agrawal (2000), Mahajan and van Ryzin (2001), and Dutta and Chakraborty (2010).

As for the mutual effect among the demands for different items, the ability to substitute is obviously a promoting factor for the substitutable item when original choices are out of stock. However, the existence of cross-selling may produce opposing effects in contrast to the substitution. Cross-selling implies that “a customer who has purchased a particular product may also be willing to purchase a related product” (Shen & Su, 2007) or that some items are always purchased together due to their unknown interior associations (Anand, Hughes, Bell, & Patrick, 1997). If one of a set of jointly demanded items is out of stock, the sales pattern for the associated items will be altered and demand for the other item in this set may decrease as a result (Wong, Fu, & Wang, 2005; Zhang, 2012; Zhang, Kaku, & Xiao, 2011). Cross-selling can be seen as a type of complementary pattern that is the distinct opposite of substitution.

Although the cross-selling effect may result in sales losses when some items are out of stock, one can also take advantage of the cross-selling effect to create new sales opportunities (Kamakura, Ramaswami, & Srivastava, 1991; Knott, Hayes, & Neslin, 2002; Kotler & Connor, 1977). In this case, the cross-selling is driven by vendors. Many studies on cross-selling have emerged in subject areas such as sales marketing, financial services, customer behavior, and data mining. One can refer to Yasar and Andy (2002), Kamakura, Wedel, de Rosa, and Mazzon (2003), Ansell, Harrison, and Archibald (2007), Salazar, Harrison, and Ansell (2007), Chuang and Lin (2008), Günes, Akşin, Örmeci, and Özden (2010), and Li, Sun, and Montgomery (2011) for the related topics. However, academic research on cross-selling in operations management does not account for a substantial proportion of the literature.


                     Akşin and Harker (1999) explored the trade-offs between service and sales in the operation of call centers in retail banking. They indicate that “cross-selling can have detrimental effects on customer service due to the additional load it creates on the system”. Güneş and Akşin (2004) further studied the worth of undertaking a value-creation initiative such as cross-selling. Byers and So (2007) proposed a queuing model for optimizing control policies for cross-selling in telephone service centers, where the probability of a successful cross-sale for the existing customer is uniformly distributed. Gurvich, Armony, and Maglaras (2009) investigated a call center with cross-selling capability and studied the operational decisions for staffing, call routing, and cross-selling according to various forms of customer segmentation. They assumed that the probability of a customer accepting a cross-selling offer was an arbitrary non-increasing continuous function of the customer wait time. Aksin, Armony, and Mehrotra (2007) administered a state-of-the-art survey and reported that cross-selling activities were a prevalent practice in call center operations management.

Some studies proposed selling bundled items as multi-product packets (packaged goods) because of negative correlations in demand and complementary consumption with the same outcome as cross-selling. Ernst and Kouvelis (1999) investigated a business practice where two items could not directly substitute for each other, while packaged goods could substitute for individual items and vice versa. Netessine, Savin, and Xiao (2006) researched the revenue management problem of cross-selling products or services in an e-commerce setting, assuming that the probability of a customer buying a two-item packet was a function of the synthetic price of the two packaged items. However, these studies focused on bundled goods being substitutable and did not correlate the cross-selling effect among the individual items.

Research on cross-selling is sparse in the existing literature on inventory management. Zhang et al. (2011) presented a deterministic two-item EOQ model with correlated demand caused by cross-selling, which was later extended to a case of multiple items (Zhang, 2012). These papers showed that lost sales of the major item can affect the demand for the minor item, wherein they introduced cross-selling into the EOQ model of inventory management.

Another relevant paper is the Netessine and Zhang (2005) investigation of the newsvendor problem with complementary items. In their paper, the demand for an item can be increased by the sale of other items, which is defined as complementarity. Thus, the effective demand for an item is equal to the sum of its original demand and the demand derived by the sales of its complementary items. Their model assumes that the original “bare” demand must be distinguishable from the derived demand. This is a rigorous condition that is not easily satisfied in the cross-selling environment in practice (this point will be examined in Section 2.1). This paper investigates NV models in the cross-selling environment without identifying original demand.

The paper contributes in the following aspects: (1) we investigate the centralized newsvendor problem with cross-selling and propose optimality conditions, bounds on the optimal solution, and a gradient-based (GB) algorithm for solving the model; (2) we propose bounds on the equilibrium order quantities for a competitive NV model and an iteration-based (IB) algorithm; and (3) we conduct numerical experiments to establish how the parameters affect newsvendor decisions in the cross-selling environment.

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 formulates the centralized NV model with cross-selling, develops the first-order conditions for optimality, and proposes the lower and upper bounds of the optimal order quantities. Section 3 presents the competitive version of the model, develops the first-order and uniqueness conditions for the Nash equilibrium, and establishes the lower and upper bounds of the equilibrium order quantities; theoretical comparisons between the two models are subsequently presented. Section 4 presents the gradient-based (GB) and iteration-based (IB) algorithms for the centralized and competitive models, respectively. Section 5 conducts a computational study through extensive numerical examples and provides some observations. Section 6 concludes the paper.

Suppose that two items, i and j (i, j
                        =1,…,
                        n), are associated with each other because of cross-selling. Let D
                        
                           i
                         denote the total demand for item i with the probability function Pr(D
                        
                           i
                        ) and the probability density function f(D
                        
                           i
                        ) (we assume that Pr(D
                        
                           i
                        ) and f(D
                        
                           i
                        ) are continuous). Total demand implies that no items are out of stock over the entire planning horizon, where the demand for an item will not be decreased because of losing the cross-sales associated with its cross-selling items. In a situation when cross-selling is driven by customers, some of item i is sold together with item j and vice versa. Therefore, if item j is out of stock and results in lost sales, some of item i is no longer in demand in comparison with total demand D
                        
                           i
                         (Zhang, 2012; Zhang et al., 2011). Let r
                        
                           ji
                         represent the cross-selling coefficient, i.e., the decreased demand for item i caused by a lost sale of one unit of item j, and Q
                        
                           i
                         indicate the order quantity of item i. Denoting that x
                        +
                        =max(x,0), the effective demand for item i over a single-period planning horizon is represented as

                           j

                           j
                        )+ represents the shortage of product j.

In Eq. (1), order quantity Q
                        
                           j
                         can be either larger or smaller than D
                        
                           j
                        , depending on the NV’s decision. In case of Q
                        
                           j

                        D
                        
                           j
                        , item j is out of stock and the demand for item i is decreased because of losing the cross-sales associated with item j. Thus, if Q
                        
                           j
                         is given, the quantity of item i in demand is equal to

                                    e
                                 
                              
                           
                         
                        effective demand. However,

                                    e
                                 
                              
                           
                         is observable only when Q
                        
                           j
                         has been determined, so 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    D
                                 
                                 
                                    i

                         is also unknown before the decision is made. To address this difficulty, we can observe the total demand {D
                        
                           i
                        }
                           i=1,…,n
                         when no items are out of stock and then formulate NV models based on the effective demand of Eq. (1).

Another parameter in Eq. (1) is the cross-selling coefficient r
                        
                           ji
                        . This can be estimated with the loss rule 
                           
                              i
                              →
                              ♢
                              j
                           
                         that provides the probability of whether the customer will not select item i because of the lost sales of item j. Consider that whenever a customer buys item i, he/she also buys item j with a certain probability. Assuming that this pattern of purchasing behavior will not change even if item j is removed from the inventory, then the probability that the customer will not select item i because of the lost sales of item j is calculated as follows (Wong et al., 2005):

                        The cross-selling coefficient can be determined as the product of

                              ♢
                              j

                         and the average number of item i in the transaction containing item set {i, j}. This paper assumes that the cross-selling coefficient can be obtained by using the above loss rule with data mining techniques.

It should be noted that although the loss rule reflects the impacts when an item is out of stock, the item need not be actually out of stock when we calculate the probability 
                           
                              conf
                              (
                              i
                              →
                              ♢

                              )
                           
                        ; the only information required is the transaction records/database (Wong et al., 2005). Therefore, the model of the effective demand can be based on the total demand D
                        
                           j
                        . In other words, we need not await the emergence of stock depletion for estimating the cross-selling coefficient. This is more applicable than the model in Netessine and Zhang (2005), and we will revisit this at the end of Section 2.1.

If demand is random, then 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    D
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                                 
                                    e
                                 
                              
                           
                         is a stochastic variable. Thus, it is more reasonable to formulate effective demand as

As previously mentioned, Netessine and Zhang (2005) proposed a model for describing the effective demand with complementarity, which is similar to cross-selling. Let d
                        
                           i
                         represent the individual/original demand for item i while no cross-selling products exist. Denote α
                        
                           ij
                        
                        ⩾0 as the proportion of customers willing to purchase item i who will also purchase item j when cross-selling products are sold together.

                         is independent and can be distinguished from the increased demand caused by the sales of other items. However, it is difficult for a manager to distinguish the original “bare” demand from the sales because it is rare that all items except one are out of stock. The most easily obtained information is total demand (D
                        
                           i

                         in Eq. (1)), which can be extrapolated from sales when there are no stock depletions in the inventory system. It is also unrealistic to assume that all items are always in stock, and we cannot know the total demand solely from sales. In this case, we suggest a demand estimation method considering unobservable lost sales, which will obtain the total demand (Agrawal & Smith, 1996; Nahmias, 1994). Otherwise, we could conduct a marketing census and integrate the known sales quantity to improve the total demand information. Therefore, we assume that the total demand can be known without requiring the information of the original “bare” demand, which is suitable for formulating a NV model in a cross-selling environment where lost sales occur.

Note that the above equations are not dependent on specific distributions of demand. Even if the distributions of demand are provided, it is still difficult to derive a closed-form solution from Eqs. (5a) and (5b) because

                         is a function of decision variable Q
                        
                           j
                        , resulting in intractability in calculating the probabilities in the equations. However, Eqs. (5a) and (5b) can be used to develop bounds for the optimal order quantity, which is beneficial in numerically solving the model. Moreover, we can also analyze the impact of cross-selling from Eq. (5b), thus providing managerial insights.

Without the second and third terms on the left-hand side, Eq. (5b) becomes the solution to the simple newsvendor problem without cross-selling. We can see that the simple NV model is generally not optimal under a cross-selling situation. It is easy to see from Eq. (1) that

This is entirely contrary to the substitution situation, where a higher degree of substitution stimulates a larger order quantity. Furthermore, based on the third term on the left-hand side of Eq. (5b), the optimal order quantity can also be increased due to the possibility that the stock depletion of item

                        Eqs. (9a) and (9b) are intractable for deriving a closed-form equilibrium solution. We will use them to develop bounds of the equilibrium order quantity for numerically solving the model and analyze managerial insights when newsvendors play games in the cross-selling environment. From Eq. (9b), we can see that the simple newsvendor solution is again suboptimal relative to the individual decision. It is obvious that the equilibrium order quantity of item i will be adjusted downward due to the lost sales of other items (see the term

                         (see Eq. (1)). This implies that an increase in any player’s order quantity increases the marginal payoff of all the other players. Therefore, if a player chooses a higher order quantity, then the other players will have an incentive to raise their order quantity. The players’ strategies are complementary to each other and the game is supermodular.

The upper bound of the equilibrium order quantity is equal to the optimal order quantity of the single-item NV model. This means that in the competitive environment, a firm will 
                           never
                         expect to stock at a single-item NV level. However, in the centralized model, Eq. (7) shows that it is possible for the optimal order quantity to be 
                           larger
                         than the order quantity in the single-item model. In the centralized model, one can coordinate the order quantities across all items and minimize the sales loss caused by cross-selling, leading to a larger effective demand. However, in a competitive situation, it is difficult to coordinate decisions across all firms. Thus, each firm conservatively replenishes its inventory by predicting that the effective demand may be decreased by the shortages of other firms’ items because of the cross-selling effect. Proposition 4 provides the uniqueness conditions of the equilibrium.

The difference between Eqs. (5b) and (9b) is that the third term on the left-hand side of Eq. (5b) does not emerge in Eq. (9b). As previously mentioned, the third term in Eq. (5b) represents the possibility that the stock depletion of item i may result in lost sales of other items. However, in a competitive situation, firm i does not make a joint decision on other firms’ businesses; therefore, the joint probability of including lost sales of other items, i.e.,

In the centralized situation, the manager can sell some unprofitable items to increase the total profit because sales of these unprofitable items may increase demand for profitable items due to cross-selling. However, the decrease in profit of the unprofitable items may be even lower than in the competitive situation.

Deriving a closed-form solution for a multi-item newsvendor problem with arbitrary distributions of demand remains a challenge because analytically solving the first-order conditions is complex. This paper employs an approximation of effective demand to define the probability of

To address substitutable demand, Rajaram and Tang (2001), Hopp and Xu (2008), and Huang et al. (2011) proposed using a specific probability distribution to approximate effective demand and avoid the multiple integrals. The basic idea for developing an approximation of effective demand is introducing a service rate, i.e., the expected proportion of the satisfied demand. Let γ

In the descent/ascent method, an important component is the linear search along the descent/ascent direction.

                        . We employ the algorithm and the open source code provided by Genz (2004) to calculate the probability of the bivariate joint normal distribution, thus calculating the gradient.

If the relative improvement of the objective function is smaller than a small positive number δ for q consecutive iterations when implementing the gradient-based (GB) algorithm, then stop. This paper sets δ
                        =0.01 and q

                        Topkis (1998) suggested a so-called “simultaneous optimization” method to solve a supermodular game. Based on this method, Huang et al. (2011) proposed an iterative algorithm for solving a competitive NV model with substitution. This paper develops a similar algorithm to solve a competitive NV model with cross-selling.

To solve the competitive model, we must determine the order quantities that satisfy Eq. (9a), that cannot be precisely realized by numerical algorithms. We introduce a relative precision factor ε

To evaluate the performances of the GB and IB algorithms, we use a grid search (GS) to enumerate possible values of the order quantities based on a predetermined step, providing solutions as a comparison. Solving the problem through GS, we first select values on the interval of order quantities bounded by the lower and upper bounds. If the predetermined precision of the order quantities is Δ, then the GS algorithm will need to check

We then generate two-item, three-item and four-item problems with asymmetric parameters, as well as two-item and three-item problems with symmetric parameters. In the two-item symmetric examples, the demand is correlated to each other and we let the demand correlation coefficient change from −1 to 1. For the other examples, the demand is independent.

                           −1)r
                           <1, which requires r
                           <0.5 for the case of n
                           =3. Thus, we let r
                           
                              ij

We will use all examples to evaluate the performance of the algorithms (Section 5.2) and investigate how the single-item NV model deviates from the optimal and the equilibrium solutions, respectively, when cross-selling exists (Section 5.3). In Section 5.4, the numerical examples are used for (1) observing the influence of cross-selling on optimal and equilibrium solutions based on (but not limited to) the two-item asymmetric examples, (2) investigating the influence of the demand correlation based on the two-item symmetric examples, (3) observing the influence of demand variance from the two-item and three-item symmetric examples, and (4) comparing the centralized NV model with the decentralized NV model based on the two-item asymmetric examples.

We set the grid search step Δ
                           =1 to solve all the numerical examples through GS and compare the results with those yielded by GB and IB. All of the algorithms are coded in Visual C++ and run on a computer with a 2.83gigahertz Intel Core 2 Quad Q9500 CPU and 4G of memory. Table 1
                            presents the computational time of the three algorithms.


                           Table 1 shows that when the item number is smaller, GS performs much better than GB. However, the computational time of GS increases rapidly as the item number becomes larger. For some 4-item examples, GS requires more than two hours to solve the NV model. Thus, for larger scale problems, it will be very difficult for GS to obtain the solution within a reasonable time. In contrast, the computational time of GB increases relatively slowly over the item number. However, IB is the most efficient algorithm; its computational time is less than one second and does not significantly increase as the item number increases. Therefore, GB and IB are competent for solving larger scale examples of the NV model.

For the centralized model, we compare the deviations of the optimal profit and the optimal order quantities between GB and GS. Let π
                           
                              GB
                            denote the best profit obtained by the GB algorithm and π
                           
                              GS
                            represent the best profit obtained by the GS method. The relative deviation is then calculated by (π

                            presents the deviation between the two algorithms.

It can be observed that the optimal order quantities of the two algorithms are very close to each other and the optimal profit obtained by GB is better than GS on average. This means that GB can provide high-quality solutions.

For the competitive model, we investigate the deviations of the first-order equilibrium conditions when solving the competitive model by IB and GS, respectively. Let ε

In Table 3, the deviations of the first-order conditions of the two algorithms are very close to 0, meaning that they both can provide high-quality equilibrium solutions. However, the deviation of GS becomes larger when the item number increases. In contrast, the deviation of IB becomes smaller when the item number increases. Thus, the IB algorithm is more effective and competent in yielding high-quality equilibrium solutions for the competitive NV model.

Because the GB and IB algorithms are more effective and efficient than GS, we will use the computational results obtained by GB and IB to obtain managerial insights from the numerical examples in the following sections.

We first define average cross-selling as the average value of cross-selling coefficients, calculated as

The above deviations represent how low the profit will be if the NV ignores the cross-selling effect when she makes decisions in a cross-selling environment. The average and maximum relative deviations of profit and order quantity under different values of the average cross-selling

                              Table 4 shows that the decision of the single-item NV model significantly deviates from the optimal solution of the centralized NV model if cross-selling exists among items. The average deviation becomes larger as the cross-selling effect becomes stronger. The maximum deviation of the profit reaches more than 40% if the average cross-selling is greater than 0.4. This proves that the stock depletion of one item will significantly affect the sales of its cross-selling items and that the cross-selling effect cannot be ignored when items are strongly complementary to each other.

We investigate how far the solution of the single-item NV model deviates from the equilibrium of the competitive NV model when cross-selling exists. Obviously, the relative deviation between the order quantities is

We can see that the solution to the single-item NV model also deviates from the equilibrium of the competitive NV model. The average and maximum deviations become larger when the cross-selling effect is stronger. It is observed that the deviation become considerably large when the average cross-selling is greater than 0.6, implying that under decentralized competitive decision, we must seriously consider cross-selling effects.

                           , which implies a larger amount of lost sales. To observe how the lost sale will occur under different cross-selling effects, we calculate the average of the ending value of the expected service rate for the NV model under different cross-selling effects, as shown in Table 6
                           .

When the cross-selling coefficient is equal to 0, the result represents the decision of the single-item NV model without the cross-selling effect; thus, the first column represents the expected service rate of the single-item NV model. In the case of a centralized decision (the first row in Table 6), the average service rate increases with respect to the average cross-selling coefficient; the newsvendor can sufficiently facilitate the cross-selling effect to increase the sales if she can deal with all items and avoid too many lost sales.

If the cross-selling effect is high, a newsvendor will be confronted with a huge decrease in demand in a competitive environment because of lost sales caused by cross-selling from other newsvendors. The crux in the decentralized decision is that the newsvendor cannot force others to increase order quantities to avoid possible lost sales. Thus, the effective demand will be lower than that in the centralized decision; the greater the cross-selling effect, the more lost sales caused by the decreased cross-selling will occur. Therefore, the newsvendor under a decentralized decision will order fewer items as the cross-selling effect becomes greater (the second row in Table 6).

Recall that in the competitive NV model with substitutions, the higher the substitution fraction, the higher the order quantities and expected profits of the equilibrium (Huang et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the above numerical results show that cross-selling results in entirely opposite effects on the equilibrium. In addition, Eq. (1) shows that the expectation of the effective demand decreases in r
                              
                                 ji
                              . In contrast, the variance of the effective demand increases with respect to r
                              
                                 ji
                               for independent demand (see Eq. (14)). Thus, the expected profit decreases in cross-selling.

It can be observed that a larger demand correlation coefficient corresponds to a smaller order quantity but a higher profit. This is in fact induced by the decrease of 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             
                                                σ

                                          i
                                       
                                       
                                          e
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               as ρ increases, where smaller order quantities can satisfy the demand when the variance is smaller.

In addition, we also observe that the solution changes more in the demand correlation coefficient if the cross-selling effect is stronger, e.g.,

                               and

                                          d
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               change more in ρ under r
                              =0.8 (the line with triangles) than in r
                              =0.2 (the line with rectangles). Checking all the examples, the common phenomena are concluded in Observation 2.
                                 Observation 2
                                 
                                    The order quantities of both models decrease but the total expected profits increase as the demand correlation coefficient increases. Moreover, an inventory system with stronger cross-selling effect is more sensitive to the demand correlation.

As expected, the right half of Fig. 3 shows that a larger demand variance will lead to lower profits (the lines of σ
                              =80 are below the lines of σ
                              =20). However, the left half of the figure shows that a larger demand variance correlates to higher order quantities (the lines of σ
                              =80 are located above those of σ
                              =20). Thus, in a situation with higher demand variance, regardless of a centralized or competitive decision, one will order more to avoid possible lost sales. Fig. 3 also shows that with the change of the cross-selling coefficient, the solution changes more if the demand variance is larger, e.g.,

                                    A larger demand variance leads to higher order quantities but lower profits, making an inventory system more sensitive to either the cross-selling effect or the demand correlation.
                                 

We compare the order quantity and the profit of the centralized and the competitive NV models, which is summarized in Observation 4.
                              Observation 4
                              
                                 For any item, the order quantity of the centralized NV model is always larger than that of the competitive NV model. The total expected profit of the centralized model is larger than that of the competitive model, but this is not the case in terms of individual items.
                              

If cross-selling effects exist across items, a centralized decision-maker can order a larger inventory to prevent losing too many sales as a consequence of unsatisfied demand due to cross-selling. However, a competitive decision-maker will select a more conservative strategy, i.e., order less inventory because she does not know whether rivals are willing to collaborate to increase their inventory to avoid losing sales.

This observation means that the profit loss of the unprofitable item can be offset by other profitable items in the centralized model because the sales of the unprofitable item can considerably increase the sales of the profitable item through cross-selling, therefore leading to more profit. However, the decision of the competitive model is made individually, where the manager is not willing to lose profit to promote the demand for the profitable item of other newsvendors through cross-selling. Thus, the competitive system cannot make the extra profit by sacrificing unprofitable items, leading to a smaller total profit.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

There have been numerous NV models based on multi-item inventory problems with substitutions. While cross-selling is a frequent practice, it has rarely been introduced into NV models as a complementary relationship among items. This paper developed multi-item centralized and competitive NV models for a newsvendor problem considering the cross-selling effect. The first-order optimality conditions of the centralized model and the equilibrium conditions of the competitive model show that the effect of cross-selling is opposite to the substitution. We also developed lower and upper bounds of the optimal order quantities and the equilibrium order quantities, respectively, for the two models.

In the case of jointly normally distributed demand, we presented a gradient-based (GB) algorithm to solve the centralized model and an iteration-based (IB) algorithm to solve the competitive model. A large number of numerical examples were produced and solved, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The computational results showed that a greater cross-selling effect correlates to a larger order quantity in the centralized NV model, but a smaller order quantity in the competitive NV model. The positive demand correlation is favorable for profit, but a greater demand variance leads to a lower profit with a larger order quantity. We also observed that competition makes decision-makers more conservative in determining the order quantity.

In a cross-selling environment, it is highly possible for newsvendors to cooperate in constructing a centralized decision system for facilitating the cross-selling effect. To this end, they must reach an agreement on the allocation of the total profit of the entire inventory system. Reaching this agreement will lead to a cooperative game problem of the NV model with cross-selling, which can be an extension of this paper.
