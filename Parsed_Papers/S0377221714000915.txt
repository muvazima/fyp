                  Inventory record inaccuracy leads to ineffective replenishment decisions and deteriorates supply chain performance. Conducting cycle counts (i.e., periodic inventory auditing) is a common approach to correcting inventory records. It is not clear, however, how inaccuracy at different locations affects supply chain performance and how an effective cycle-count program for a multi-stage supply chain should be designed. This paper aims to answer these questions by considering a serial supply chain that has inventory record inaccuracy and operates under local base-stock policies. A random error, representing a stock loss, such as shrinkage or spoilage, reduces the physical inventory at each location in each period. The errors are cumulative and are not observed until a location performs a cycle count. We provide a simple recursion to evaluate the system cost and propose a heuristic to obtain effective base-stock levels. For a two-stage system with identical error distributions and counting costs, we prove that it is more effective to conduct more frequent cycle counts at the downstream stage. In a numerical study for more general systems, we find that location (proximity to the customer), error rates, and counting costs are primary factors that determine which stages should get a higher priority when allocating cycle counts. However, it is in general not effective to allocate all cycle counts to the priority stages only. One should balance cycle counts between priority stages and non-priority stages by considering secondary factors such as lead times, holding costs, and the supply chain length. In particular, more cycle counts should be allocated to a stage when the ratio of its lead time to the total system lead time is small and the ratio of its holding cost to the total system holding cost is large. In addition, more cycle counts should be allocated to downstream stages when the number of stages in the supply chain is large. The analysis and insights generated from our study can be used to design guidelines or scorecard systems that help managers design better cycle-count policies. Finally, we discuss implications of our study on RFID investments in a supply chain.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Inventory record inaccuracy refers to the discrepancy between physical inventory held in stock and the record of inventory stored in the information system of a firm. Shrinkage, spoilage, misplaced inventories, and transaction errors (e.g., scanning errors and incorrectly counting products) contribute to inaccurate inventory information. Inaccurate inventory information leads to ineffective replenishment decisions, which, in turn, result in poor service levels and higher inventory costs. This is a major issue affecting supply chain performance in manufacturing, distribution and retail settings. For example, DeHoratius and Raman (2008) found records to be inaccurate 65% of the items stored at a publicly traded retailer. According to ECR ECR Europe (2003), the value of lost inventory due to shrinkage in 2000 was €13.4billion for retailers and €4.6billion for manufacturers in Europe.

A common method to mitigate the impact of inventory inaccuracy is to conduct cycle counts. Companies usually implement cycle-count policies according to an ABC classification scheme, i.e., classifying products into A, B, C classes based on product attributes, such as volume, error rate and value, and assigning a count cycle to each class (Jordan, 1994). Motivated by empirical studies and business practice, researchers recently have developed various analytical models, aiming to study this problem more rigorously (see Section 2 below). To our knowledge, all of the existing analytical results are on single-location models. Nevertheless, major apparel retailers and consumer-packaged goods companies have significant inaccuracy problems across their supply chains. Managers have limited knowledge of the extent of inaccuracy at different locations and their impact on overall supply chain performance (Delen, Hardgrave, & Sharda, 2009; Hardgrave, Aloysius, & Goyal, 2009, 2013). In this study, we investigate the impact of inventory inaccuracy on the supply chain performance. In particular, we aim to answer the following questions: (1) What is the impact of inventory inaccuracy at a location on the entire supply chain performance? (2) Given the fact that cycle counts are costly, which locations should have more frequent counts? (3) How should different product attributes and system characteristics be taken into account when designing cycle-count policies in a supply chain? The answers to these questions are not readily available in the academic and business literatures. While one may argue that record inaccuracy at downstream locations has a greater impact because of proximity to customers, inaccuracy at an upstream location affects the supply for all downstream locations. Similarly, one may argue that maintaining accurate records at a location with a longer lead time is more important because such locations are slower to respond to demand changes. On the other hand, such locations generally have more pipeline and safety stock, which implies that they would be affected less by record inaccuracy.

In this paper, we consider a periodic-review, N-stage serial supply chain with inventory record inaccuracy. Random customer demand arrives at stage 1. Stage 1 replenishes from stage 2, stage 2 from stage 3, and so on, and stage N from an outside supplier with ample supply. There are constant transportation lead times between stages. Record inaccuracy is caused by a random inventory loss that reduces physical inventory. (See Section 2 for a discussion on the other causes of inventory inaccuracy.) To describe inventory inaccuracy, we use the term “nominal” to signify inventory records stored in the computer system, and “actual” to signify the physical inventory levels. Each stage implements a cycle-count policy to correct the inventory records. A fixed stage-specific inspection cost is incurred for each cycle count. Errors at each stage are cumulative and they are not observed by the information system unless the stage conducts a cycle count. Thus, the discrepancy between the nominal inventory and the actual inventory equals the accumulated error since the last cycle count. The material flow is controlled by local base-stock policies. That is, if the local nominal inventory order position at a stage is less than a target base-stock level, the stage places an order to raise the nominal inventory position to the target level. Such a replenishment scheme is commonly seen in practice and most firms have computer systems automate this process. The objective is to minimize the actual average total supply-chain cost per period.

To evaluate the system cost, we derive the actual local inventory variables for any given cycle-count policy. However, obtaining these local inventory variables requires characterizing the local demand for each stage. One key contribution of this paper is that we provide a simple procedure to evaluate the system cost. This procedure recursively evaluates the cost for each echelon (a stage and all of its downstream stages) starting from echelon 1 to echelon N. Moreover, this recursion leads to a heuristic to find local base-stock levels. A numerical study suggests that the heuristic is effective. We then use these results to answer the research questions.

For two-stage systems, regarding the impact of errors, we show that it is more costly to have the same error occur at the downstream stage than at the upstream stage. Furthermore, regarding the cycle-count policies, we show that it is always a better strategy to assign more cycle counts to the downstream stage than to the upstream stage when both stages have identical errors and counting costs. For more general systems, we categorize system parameters into two groups in terms of their effect on cycle-count policy decisions. Primary factors determine which stages should get a higher priority when allocating cycle counts. They include location (position in the supply chain), error rate, and counting cost. All else being equal, downstream locations should be assigned more frequent counts. However, a significantly higher error rate or lower counting cost at an upstream stage may reverse the result. We observe that the marginal benefit of cycle counts is decreasing in its frequency. Thus, one should not allocate all cycle counts to a single location. We therefore suggest using secondary factors to determine whether the policy should strongly favor the high-priority stages or allocate counts in a more balanced way. The secondary factors include lead time and holding cost structure and the supply chain length. We find that more cycle counts should be allocated to a stage if the ratio of the stage’s lead time to the total system lead time is small and the ratio of the stage’s holding cost to the total holding cost is large. Furthermore, more cycle counts should be allocated to downstream stages if the supply chain is long (i.e., the number of stages in the supply chain is large).

Our research questions have implications for investment decisions on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems. Specifically, if a location installs RFID readers, this will, in principle, eliminate inventory inaccuracy by continuously monitoring the inventory. This has the same effect as conducting a cycle count in each period in our model. In fact, many RFID applications in retail supply chains involve hand-held RFID readers, whose role is to facilitate cycle counting. Because RFID implementation can be very costly (Kearney, 2004), many industry practitioners are concerned about where RFID readers should be installed in a supply chain (Chappell et al., 2002). Labor savings and investment costs of RFID systems can be quantified in each stage in isolation from others (Chopra & Sodhi, 2007), but it is not clear how one can quantify the impact of reducing inaccuracy at a particular stage on supply chain performance. The guidelines developed in this paper have implications on how to prioritize RFID investments in a supply chain.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses major causes of inventory inaccuracy in supply chains and reviews the literature related to each of the causes. Section 3 presents a single-stage model and discusses the model set-up. Section 4 introduces the serial system and provides a scheme to evaluate the average total cost per period. Section 5 presents the lower bound and the heuristic algorithm. Section 6 presents our analytical and numerical results and provide answers to the research questions. Section 7 concludes. All proofs are provided in Appendix A.

Empirical research and industry reports indicate that shrinkage, transaction errors, and misplaced items are the main reasons that cause inventory inaccuracy (ECR Europe, 2003; Raman & Ton, 2003; Sheppard & Brown, 1993). In the following, we describe each type of inaccuracy and its impact on the supply chain.


                     Shrinkage, also known as stock loss, may be due to theft by shoppers or employees, and spoiled and damaged inventory. The impact of shrinkage on the actual inventory is one-sided: it always reduces the actual inventory. Thus, the inventory record is always greater than or equal to the actual inventory when shrinkage is the only reason that causes inventory inaccuracy. Our model considers this type of inaccuracy. In a supply chain, inventory shrinkages between locations are often independent because losing a unit of inventory at one location is not related to that at another location.

Shrinkage is found to be the dominant cause of inventory inaccuracy in many empirical studies. Kang and Gershwin (2005) report two firms for which the majority of the inventory inaccuracy is due to stock loss. Similarly, ECR Europe (2001, 2003) conduct a comprehensive study over more than 200 companies and suggest that stock loss errors may be more prominent than others. In these studies, shrinkage is estimated to be about 1.7% of the sales for retailers and 0.56% for manufacturers. The National Retail Security Survey of 118 retailers (Hollinger, 2003) reports similar results. These studies emphasize the stockout effects of shrinkage. Chen (2013) proposes a data-driven optimal inspection policy for a single-item model. Fleisch and Tellkamp (2005) conduct a simulation study on the impact of inventory shrinkage for a three-echelon supply chain. Arguably, shrinkage has the most direct impact on supply chain performance because shrinkage at an upstream location will directly affect the stock availability of its downstream location, which may, in turn, lead to significant stockouts or backlogs for the system. In order to directly address this issue affecting many supply chains, we consider only shrinkage-type inaccuracy in the present paper.


                     Transaction errors refer to errors caused by misidentification of the items or miscounting of the items in inbound and outbound processes. This transaction will make the actual inventory larger (smaller) than the nominal inventory. Thus, the impact of transaction error on the actual inventory is two-sided: it may increase or decrease the actual inventory. Iglehart and Morey (1972) is the first paper to consider transaction errors in a single-stage model. The inventory system implements a base-stock policy and the objective is to find the cycle-count frequency that minimizes inspection and inventory holding costs subject to a pre-specified inaccuracy probability. In an empirical study of one retailer’s records, DeHoratius and Raman (2008) report that the difference between physical inventory and inventory record can be positive or negative. They also find that the extent of errors increases with sales volume, the number of stages in the supply chain, and product variety. There are recent papers that investigate optimal and effective inventory and inspection policies for single-stage model, e.g., Kök and Shang (2007), DeHoratius, Mersereau, and Schrage (2008), Sahin, Buzacott, and Dallery (2008), Deshpande, Schwarz, and Raju (2009), Sahin and Dallery (2009), and Mersereau (2012). To our knowledge, there has been no work on investigating the impact of transaction errors on a multi-stage supply chain.


                     Misplaced or inaccessible inventory refers to inventory that is physically at the facility, but its exact location is unknown. The impact of misplaced inventory is also one-sided: it reduces actual inventory levels. However, unlike shrinkage, misplaced inventory is not permanently lost; it may be recovered and added to the actual inventory after a cycle count. Rekik, Sahin, Jemai, and Dallery (2008) investigate the impact of different types of misplacement errors for a retailer–supplier system under a newsvednor framework. Çamdereli and Swaminathan (2009) study inventory decisions and coordination contracts for a system similar to Rekik et al.

Incorporating all error types in a model without any simplifying assumptions is a difficult task even for single-stage systems. Atali, Lee, and Özer (2005) and Bensoussan, Çakanyıldırım, and Sethi (2007) consider multiple types of errors in a single-stage model. The former assumes that errors occur independently from the current inventory levels in order to derive inventory policies. The latter develops a heuristic feedback policy due to the dimensionality of the problem. We refer the reader to Chen and Mersereau (2013) for a review on inventory inaccuracy issues and models.

Our research also pertains to the literature with RFID. One of the benefits of RFID systems is greater visibility of material flow and order progress. Gaukler, Özer, and Hausman (2008) and Kim, Klabjan, and Simchi-Levi (2007) study expediting strategies given the accurate order progress information from upstream stages. Bottani, Montanari, and Volpi (2010) investigates the impact of RFID on mitigating the bullwhip effect in the Italian FMCG supply chain. Pei and Klabjan (2010) study the optimal inventory policy for a serial system in which RFID systems provide order progress information for replenishments and shipments. They compare the expected costs of the model with different levels of RFID deployment and find that broader deployment reduces costs. This group of papers focuses on gaining visibility into order movements that are usually modeled with a stochastic lead time. Our focus is different in that we compare the benefit of reducing inaccuracy at different stages in a supply chain. For a review of the literature on RFID-related models and future applications, see Zipkin (2006) and Lee and Özer (2007).

The present paper builds on the literature on multi-echelon inventory systems, particularly the classical serial supply chain model studied by Clark and Scarf (1960), Chen and Zheng (1994), and many others. We incorporate inventory record inaccuracy and cycle-count policies in the serial system by introducing unobserved inventory errors at each stage. This leads to an additional dimension in the inventory dynamics and expands the set of decision variables.

Finally, this paper is related to inventory/production systems with random yields. For single-stage yield models under periodic review, Henig and Gerchak (1990) show that base-stock type policies are optimal. Lee and Yano (1988) study a multi-stage model for a single production run to meet a single-period demand. Liu, So, and Zhang (2010) consider the impact of supply reliability on inventory and pricing decisions. On a related topic, Bollapragada, Rao, and Zhang (2004) consider assembly systems with random capacity at each location that are controlled with base-stock policies. In random yield and random capacity models, the uncertainty at every stage is observable in each period after it is realized, which removes any uncertainty about inventory levels in the supply chain. In our model, however, the errors at a stage are not observed and accumulate until a cycle count is performed.

In this section we consider a single-stage system. We use this model to illustrate the assumptions and the concept of nominal and actual inventory variables. This discussion sets the stage for the serial system.

                      periods for the long-run average cost calculations. The system implements a cycle-count policy to correct the inventory record. That is, the stage conducts a cycle count every T periods, where T represents the cycle-count interval. The system incurs a fixed cost of K every time a cycle count is conducted. Errors in the system accumulate and are not observed until a cycle count is conducted. As a result, the discrepancy between actual and nominal inventory positions is nondecreasing between two cycle counts. One may view this system as consisting of two processes: (1) The actual inventory dynamics and the cost evaluation process based on the actual inventory and (2) the ordering process in which orders are placed based on the nominal inventory order position (or inventory record). Below is the sequence of events in each period.
                        
                           (1)
                           The stage receives a shipment at the beginning of a period,

random error and random customer demand occurs during the period,

if the current period is a cycle-count period, then the stage conducts a cycle count,

the stage places an order according to the nominal inventory order position,

costs are evaluated at the end of the period.

We assume that the random demand and error processes during the period are interleaving Poisson processes.
                        1
                        The model can be generalized to allow for general demand and error distributions if periodic demand were realized first, depleted the inventory and then the error occurred.
                     
                     
                        1
                      The actual inventory level at the end of a period is the beginning actual inventory level minus the sum of the two Poisson random variables, i.e., one period of demand and one period of error, regardless of our assumptions about the order of the two processes.

We now describe how these events affect the nominal and actual inventory variables. We define the following inventory variables to facilitate the subsequent discussion.

We make the following remarks about the model assumptions. First, the assumption of independent and identically distributed errors implies that the error distribution is independent of the inventory level. While certain types of inventory losses, such as invisible demand may satisfy this assumption, other error types such as shrinkage or spoilage can occur only when inventory level is positive. We make this assumption for tractability of the model. Modeling the dependence on inventory level would require keeping track of periodic demand and error during lead time as a vector. This would cause the size of the state space to grow intractably large, which is similar to the difficulty in the lost-sales system. Second, for tractability, we assume that the discrepancy between the actual inventory and nominal inventory is reconciled only when a cycle count is performed. There is no correction of the records due to the occurrence of a backorder. That is, if the computer shows the item in stock but it is actually not available, the demand is backlogged and the backorder information is not used to correct the records. Because we ignore the occurrence of such corrections in our characterization of the system state, the present model can be seen as an approximation to the systems that utilize the backlog information to correct records when the backlog probability is small. Many companies either do not have proper systems in place to update their computer records or do not allow line workers to change system records to ensure data integrity. Third, demand fulfillment and cost calculation are based only on actual on-hand inventory 
                        
                           
                              
                                 (
                                 AIL
                                 )
                              
                              
                                 +
                              
                           
                        
                      and actual backlogged demand B. In daily operations, a company may do its accounting based on the inventory records. However, at the end of a year, the annual cost according to the information system may be different from the actual annual cost, which is realized based on the actual inventory dynamics. This difference is due to the inaccuracy of the records. Therefore, a reconciliation by the accounting department is always necessary.

We use an example to illustrate the inventory dynamics under the nominal and actual inventory schemes. Consider a single-stage system with

                     (a) illustrates the dynamics of the nominal inventory order position and inventory level. Fig. 1(b) illustrates the corresponding actual inventory variables. The demand and error levels in each period are given in the figure. The system has conducted a cycle count at the end of period

Let us first focus on the nominal inventory variables shown in Fig. 1(a). We assume that

We now show how to evaluate the average system cost per period. The inventory dynamics result in a regenerative process. Specifically, if the system conducts a cycle count at the end of period

                     . Because the errors are nonnegative, the nominal inventory terms are always greater than or equal to the actual terms. Hence, after a cycle count, the corrected nominal inventory position cannot be more than the target base-stock level s and the system can order up to the target level after aligning the nominal terms with the actual ones. In order to analyze this regenerative process that has a cycle length of T periods, we set the beginning of periods

The second equation is due to the replenishment policy that orders to cover the demand in the no-cycle-count periods and the demand and the accumulated error in the cycle-count period. The third and fourth equations are similar to those in the standard base-stock models and reflect the effect of the lead time. The last statement gives the distribution of backlogged customer demand given the total backlog level. From the moment AIL falls to zero until the end of the period, two Poisson processes reduce AIL, but only customer arrivals cause a backlog penalty. The process after AIL falls to zero is independent of the demand and error realizations before that point because of the memoryless property of the Poisson process. Hence, the fraction of total backlog that is due to customer demand follows a Binomial distribution with number of trials equal to

                     . This accounts for the system incurring the backorder penalty for only customer demands when the actual inventory level is less than or equal to zero, but not for the error process. In the example in Fig. 1, the actual inventory level in period

                      is three units after replenishment and minus two units at the end of the period (after two units of error and three units of demand). The actual backlogged demand level, however, depends on the realized sequence of the error and demand occurrences. Proposition 1 tells us that

Proposition 3 states that the optimal base-stock level and the optimal inventory cost increase with the cycle-count interval length T. When the cycle-count interval is longer, more periods of error accumulate in the system. Thus, the system has to maintain a higher stock level to cover the inventory loss and the additional uncertainty. The higher stock level leads to a higher optimal system cost.

For stage 1, the sequence of events is the same as that for the single-stage system. For stages

                     , the sequence of events is similar to stage 1. Specifically,
                        
                           (1)
                           at the beginning of a period, stage j receives a shipment sent

                               periods ago,

random error occurs during the period,

downstream order (or local demand) arrives at the end of a period,

stage j sends a shipment to stage 
                                 
                                    j
                                    -
                                    1
                                 
                              ,

stage j conducts a cycle count, if the current period is a cycle-count period,

stage j places an order according to the nominal inventory order position at the end of a period,

costs are evaluated based on the actual inventory level.

Below we discuss how to evaluate the average total cost per period. In Section 4.1, we show how to evaluate the cost using local inventory variables. In Section 4.2, we provide an alternative approach, which evaluates the cost using the corresponding echelon variables. This echelon approach simplifies the computation significantly and sets the stage for the subsequent analysis.

To explain how these events affect inventory variables, we define the following local inventory variables.

We end this section with a connection to the literature on the bullwhip phenomenon. Lee, Padmanabhan, and Whang (1997) demonstrate four reasons that can lead to the bullwhip effect in supply chains. The above characterization of the local demand for each stage indicates that the mean and variance of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    D
                                 
                                 
                                    j
                                 
                              
                           
                         are larger than those of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    D
                                 
                                 
                                    j
                                    -
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                        . Furthermore, the increase in variance is larger if cycle-count interval of stage 
                           
                              (
                              j
                              -
                              1
                              )
                           
                         is longer. Thus, inventory loss across locations in a supply chain is another factor that may contribute to the bullwhip effect.

The above procedure to obtain the total cost per period and the computation is quite complicated because we need to compute the distribution of the local demand 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    D
                                 
                                 
                                    j
                                 
                              
                           
                         for all stages and periods. We next provide a simple echelon scheme to evaluate the total system cost. This scheme allows us to bypass the computation of the distribution of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    D

                        . Below we define the echelon inventory variables and present the relationships between the local and echelon inventory variables. These relationships are standard and can be found in Zipkin (2000).

The recursion in the proposition enables us to easily evaluate the system cost for a given set of base-stock levels. In the next section, we use this recursion to generate a heuristic solution for the optimal base-stock levels and develop a lower bound on the optimal cost.

The above bottom-up recursion is similar to that for the classic multi-echelon inventory problem (e.g., Chen, 1999; Chen & Zheng, 1994). However, unlike the classic problem, the optimal solution cannot be obtained by minimizing

                     . In Section 5.1, we derive a lower bound on the total cost per period for any local base-stock policy. In Section 5.2, we present a heuristic algorithm based on the recursion above. As we shall show in a numerical study, the heuristic solution is near-optimal and therefore can be used to draw insights about supply chains with inventory record inaccuracy.

We establish a lower bound to the total cost under any local base-stock policy, i.e., a lower bound to the minimal cost that can be achieved. We compute the lower bound by replacing

Theorem 1 states that it is more effective to conduct more frequent cycle counts at a downstream stage for a two-stage system with identical error distributions. Intuitively, when stage 1 conducts a cycle count, it will order the demand plus the error from stage 2. From the perspective of stage 2, this error will reduce stage 2’s inventory position in the same fashion as if it had conducted a cycle count and the same amount of error was identified. Thus, conducting a cycle count at stage 1 essentially mitigates the impact of error at both stages. This result holds for any

                        , but may not hold otherwise, depending on the scale of counting costs relative to the scale of inventory costs. Notice that Theorem 1 holds for the optimal base-stock levels, because the heuristic yields the optimal base-stock level for stage 1, and the proof shows the result for any echelon inventory level y in the stage 2 cost function. This result demonstrates that, all else being equal, more attention should be paid to the downstream location. Nevertheless, designing an effective cycle-count policy requires an understanding of how the relative impact changes with supply chain properties such as the lead times and the supply chain length. We conduct a numerical study to answer these questions in Section 6.

This section provides a numerical study to investigate how system parameters affect cycle-count policies. These numerical observations will lead to guidelines for designing effective cycle-count policies.

We use our heuristic base-stock policy to answer these questions through a sensitivity analysis study. We focus our discussion on both two-stage and four-stage systems. The parameters we use in the sensitivity analysis are as follows: For the two-stage system, the parameters

                        We tested another set of experiment with normal demand and error distributions. All the subsequent insights remain valid. For the normal distribution case, we assume that the error and demand distributions are i.i.d between periods, and an error occurs at the beginning of a period, followed by the demand.

We define the percentage difference between the heuristic cost and the lower bound cost as

                     , respectively. The average difference is 0.29% for four-stage systems. We conclude that our heuristic base-stock levels are near optimal. We therefore use it to answer the above research questions.

The purpose of the sensitivity analysis study is to examine the impact of varying one specific parameter on the total cost. Therefore, we need to select a base case as a reference point. We select the following two-stage system as our base case:

                        . Clearly, different parameter sets may lead to larger or smaller magnitude of the effects. However, we are interested more in the insights obtained by observing the direction of the change in the total cost in response to the system parameters.

We summarize main observations from the numerical study below. Notice that a curve in Figs. 2–7
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                         is obtained by starting with a base case and changing only the variable specified in the horizontal axis. For example, in Fig. 2, the “diamond” shape curve shows the cost reduction for the four-stage base case under different cycle-count policies; the “square” shape curve shows the same when we increase the error rate at stage 3 in the same four-stage case.

                                 Fig. 2 shows the impact of conducting cycle counts on different locations in four-stage systems. We find that the result in Theorem 1 holds for longer supply chains as well: With identical error rates and counting costs, a downstream cycle count is more effective than an upstream cycle count. A cycle count at an upstream stage could be more beneficial to the system only when the error rate at that location is significantly higher than the downstream locations.


                                 Fig. 3 shows the benefit of conducting cycle counts under various lead time ratios for the two-stage base case. We particularly consider two cycle-count policies:

                                  and (12,1). The former (the latter) represents conducting more frequent counts at stage 1 (stage 2). From the top curve, we observe that the benefit of cycle counts at the downstream location decreases as the share of the downstream lead time increases. Since a shorter lead time implies less stock, this result suggests that a leaner downstream stage is more vulnerable to the error.


                                 Fig. 4(a) and (b) illustrate the two conclusions observed above for the four-stage base system.

The benefit of cycle counts at a location increases if the ratio of the holding cost to the total holding cost increases. Intuitively, when the holding cost is larger, the stage will carry less inventory, making the impact of errors more significant.

                                  (i.e., 2.1–3.5%). This observation suggests that cycle counts should be focused on both stage 1 and stage 2 (on stage 1) when

                                 ). Thus, a rough guideline based on this conclusion for systems with similar error rates and counting costs is that cycle counts should be focused more on the downstream half of the supply chain.

More importantly, the first additional upstream cycle count may be more beneficial to the system than the third additional downstream count. This result immediately suggests that it is not a good strategy to allocate all cycle counts to a single location. Instead, cycle counts should be allocated across locations in a dynamic way.

Based on observation 6, an effective cycle-count policy must assign the first few cycle counts downstream but then keep a reasonably balanced allocation of the total cycle counts available. Fig. 7(a) shows that

Hence, a balanced policy is usually better than a policy that heavily favors downstream locations. Nevertheless, we know that as the downstream lead time share decreases downstream counts have a larger impact. Fig. 7(b) compares policies

                                  as that ratio decreases. Hence, the balance should be tilted slightly towards downstream locations in supply chains with short downstream lead times. These guidelines carry over to longer supply chains.

The above observations are drawn from the base cases, in which each stage has identical counting cost. Clearly, stage counting costs directly affect cycle-count decisions. While observation 1 suggests that downstream counts are more beneficial to the system when counting costs are identical, the result will be reversed if downstream counting costs are significantly higher than upstream counting costs. Table 1 illustrates the optimal cycle-count policies for various counting cost combinations in a two-stage system. The optimal cycle-count policy is obtained by searching over all 36 feasible policies with

                                 , it is optimal to count more frequently downstream, indicating that location in the supply chain should play a very significant role in counting decisions. In addition, the optimal cycle-count policy is 
                                    
                                       (

                                  for the base case and a wide range of counting costs around that, indicating that optimal cycle-count policy is not very sensitive to the counting cost structure.

Based on these observations, we categorize the factors that affect cycle-count decisions into two groups. Primary factors determine which stages should get priority (i.e., higher cycle-count frequency). These factors are 
                           
                              (
                              i
                              )
                           
                         stage (position in the supply chain) 
                           
                              (
                              ii
                              )
                           
                         error rate, and 
                           
                              (
                              iii
                              )
                           
                         counting cost. Secondary factors determine whether the policy should strongly favor the high-priority stages or allocate counts in a somewhat balanced way. These are 
                           
                              (
                              i
                              )
                           
                         lead time structure, 
                           
                              (
                              ii
                              )
                           
                         holding cost structure, and 
                           
                              (
                              iii
                              )
                           
                         the length of the supply chain.

These two groups of factors can be used to provide the following guidelines for designing effective cycle-count policies. When allocating a fixed budget or a fixed number of cycle countsin a supply chain, a manager should first consider primary factors by allocating first few cycle counts to downstream locations and locations with significantly higher error rate or low counting cost. Then, the manager should consider the secondary factors to allocate the remaining cycle counts. For example, if the ratio of the lead time of a downstream stage to the total system lead time is large, the manager should allocate the remaining cycle counts to keep a more balanced distribution rather than focusing on the downstream stage. On the other hand, if the supply chain is long, the manager should allocate the remaining counts to favor the few downstream stages.

Finally, our model and analysis also provide implications on RFID investments from the perspective of reducing inventory inaccuracy. Consider the following settings with RFID. 
                           
                              (
                              i
                              )
                           
                         In some settings with tagged products, RFID provides perpetual information in locations where readers are installed. This scenario can be evaluated with our framework. For example, for a production line at a factory with a six-stage process, a reader in stages 3 and 5 is equivalent to a cycle-count policy 
                           
                              (
                              12
                              ,

                              ,
                              1
                              ,
                              12
                              )
                           
                        . 
                           
                              (
                              ii
                              )
                           
                         In some other settings, the cost of readers may be small relative to the cost of RFID tags. In that case, the problem is to decide the at which stage the tags should be put on the products. For example, if stage 3 and its downstream stages have tagged products, this is equivalent to policy 
                           
                              (

                         In the apparel industry, it is common to use hand-held RFID readers to do cycle-counts. In this case, the store staff performs cycle counts using the handheld readers near shelves or hangers. These cycle counts are faster (less costly) and possibly more accurate than manual counts. Our results on cycle-count policies are directly relevant for this setting. RFID investment determines which stages have relatively low counting costs and therefore count more often. In any of these scenarios, a supply chain manager needs to do a cost-benefit analysis for the RFID investment. It has been suggested in the literature that from the perspective of labor cost savings, upstream stages (back-end operations) should be RFID-enabled first (Chopra & Sodhi, 2007). Our results suggest that, from the perspective of record inaccuracy, all else being equal, downstream stages should get priority.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Inventory record inaccuracy is a prevalent issue that affects supply chain performance. While common mitigation approaches such as conducting cycle counts and installing inventory tracking systems have been adopted by many firms, there are no clear guidelines in the literature on how to design cycle-count policies from the perspective of the entire supply chain. This paper aims to shed light on this issue.

For a two-stage system, we prove that with identical errors and counting costs at both stages, it is always more effective to conduct more frequent cycle counts at the downstream stage. In a numerical study, we find that the above conclusion holds for more general systems unless an upstream stage has a significantly higher error rate or lower counting cost. In particular, more cycle counts should be allocated to a downstream stage if the proportion of its lead time to the system lead time is small, the proportion of its holding cost to the total holding cost is large, or the number of stages in the supply chain is large. However, because the marginal benefit of cycle counts is decreasing in its frequency, it is not a good strategy to assign all the cycle counts to the downstream stages. Based on our analytical and numerical results, we conclude that, in addition to the existing attributes such as volume, error rates, value and counting costs suggested by practitioners, companies should consider the following attributes when designing system-wide cycle-count programs: location in the supply chain, lead times, holding costs, and the number of stages in the supply chain.

There are several interesting future research directions from both an academic and practical point of view. First, for tractability, we assume that the errors are independent of the on-hand inventory levels. While in practice errors should depend on the on-hand inventory level, we believe that our key insight remains valid. This is because the downstream stage in general holds more inventory at optimality in a supply chain, which implies that the error is larger at downstream stages. Thus, more cycle counts should be allocated to downstream stages. Nevertheless, from a practical perspective, it remains an open question how to optimize the system with inventory-dependent errors. Second, we assume that record inaccuracy is removed only if a cycle-count is performed. Some companies may have systems in place to correct inventory records even in the no-cycle-count periods if a backorder occurs and the record shows the product in-stock. It would be interesting to generalize the current model to accommodate such practice. Third, we consider only stationary base-stock policies However, other replenishment policies that depend on accumulated errors should be more effective. It would be interesting to investigate the value yielded from a more sophisticated error-dependent policy. Finally, the serial system is a special case of supply chain systems. It is important to study the cycle count policies for more general systems, such as assembly and distribution systems. The modeling approach (i.e., inventory shrinkage and cycle counts), evaluation schemes and the optimization procedure may be useful for analyzing these general systems.
