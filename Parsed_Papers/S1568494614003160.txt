               Abstract
               
                  The amount of online transactions is growing these days to a large number. A big portion of these transactions contains credit card transactions. The growth of online fraud, on the other hand, is notable, which is generally a result of ease of access to edge technology for everyone. There has been research done on many models and methods for credit card fraud prevention and detection. Artificial Immune Systems is one of them. However, organizations need accuracy along with speed in the fraud detection systems, which is not completely gained yet. In this paper we address credit card fraud detection using Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), and introduce a new model called AIS-based Fraud Detection Model (AFDM). We will use an immune system inspired algorithm (AIRS) and improve it for fraud detection. We increase the accuracy up to 25%, reduce the cost up to 85%, and decrease system response time up to 40% compared to the base algorithm.
