                  This paper presents the formulation and performance analysis of four techniques for detection of a narrowband acoustic source in a shallow range-independent ocean using an acoustic vector sensor (AVS) array. The array signal vector is not known due to the unknown location of the source. Hence all detectors are based on a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) which involves estimation of the array signal vector. One non-parametric and three parametric (model-based) signal estimators are presented. It is shown that there is a strong correlation between the detector performance and the mean-square signal estimation error. Theoretical expressions for probability of false alarm and probability of detection are derived for all the detectors, and the theoretical predictions are compared with simulation results. It is shown that the detection performance of an AVS array with a certain number of sensors is equal to or slightly better than that of a conventional acoustic pressure sensor array with thrice as many sensors.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Acoustic vector sensors (AVS) are different from traditional acoustic pressure sensors (APS) or hydrophones in that they measure the components of particle velocity in addition to the acoustic pressure [1]. AVS technology with co-located pressure and velocity sensors has grown rapidly in recent years due to the established superiority of AVS over APS in signal processing applications. This superiority stems from the fact that particle velocity measurements provide additional information about the acoustic field, viz., the direction of the impinging acoustic waves. While an APS array can extract directional information by measuring the propagation delay between sensors, a single AVS can obtain this information directly from the particle velocity measurements. These measurements also enable unambiguous bearing estimation of underwater sources using shorter and/or sparser AVS arrays, in contrast to APS arrays which suffer from several ambiguities [1–4].

Velocity sensors per se are not new. They have been available and used for quite some time. However, the importance of simultaneous measurement of acoustic pressure and particle velocity was first demonstrated experimentally by DʼSpain et al. [4] in 1991, sparking interest in the development of acoustic vector sensors. Since then, several experimental setups such as the DIFAR array [5] and the recently conducted Makai experiment [6] have demonstrated the effectiveness of AVS. The impressive performance of vector sensors has been demonstrated in numerous signal processing applications such as source direction-finding and localization [3,7–26], tracking [27–29], communication [30–32], geo-acoustic inversion [33] and source detection [34,35]. The compactness and improved performance of AVS arrays make them ideal for use in fields such as underwater acoustic surveillance for port security [36] and underwater imaging [37].

The initial theoretical framework for signal processing applications using an AVS array was developed by Nehorai and Paldi [1] who presented the AVS array measurement model for plane waves propagating in a homogeneous medium. Several theoretical treatments of the AVS followed, and numerous algorithms for direction-finding and localization of sources employing AVS have been developed. These include modifications of existing direction-of-arrival estimation (DOA) algorithms such as the Capon algorithm [3], MUSIC [10,38], ROOT-MUSIC [11], ESPRIT [8,9,12,13,16,17,38], MLE [18,19], and SIM [20,22] as well as other [23–26] algorithms. In a series of papers, Hawkes and Nehorai dealt with theoretical aspects of AVS signal processing, such as characterization of the AVS array performance in terms of error measures and the Cramer–Rao bound (CRB) [2,39], and characterization of intra-sensor and inter-sensor correlation of noise in an AVS array [40]. The performance bounds on direction finding using AVS have also been investigated by Tam and Wong [41]. Hawkes and Nehorai also illustrated how a distributed AVS array can function as a sensor network for localization [14]. In this setup, each AVS can function as a separate node of the network. Zha and Qiu [16] illustrated how the AVS could be employed for bearing estimation when the environment is contaminated by impulsive noise. Tichavsky et al. [13] demonstrated that a single AVS can be used for direction-finding of an acoustic source in far-field or near-field. Wu and Wong [21] have presented the near-field array manifold of the AVS, thus opening the doors for near-field AVS array signal processing applications. Later, they presented a method of near-field source localization using one triad of velocity sensors and one APS [23]. The problem of tracking source azimuth using an AVS was studied by Felisberto et al. [27]. Zhong et al. [28] explored the possibility of two-dimensional DOA tracking of acoustic sources with AVS using particle filtering. The feasibility of using AVS in underwater acoustic communications was demonstrated by Song et al. [30,31] and Abdi et al. [32]. The AVS may also be employed as an effective measurement system for the estimation of geo-acoustic parameters [33].

Work on the development of algorithms for signal detection in shallow ocean using an AVS array is of recent origin [34,35]. In [34] and [35], the authors have proposed several detection strategies such as the energy detector (ED), subspace detector (SD), truncated subspace detector (TSD) and approximate signal form detector (ASFD), for narrowband detection of a source in a range-independent ocean with Gaussian ambient noise. All detectors are based on a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) [42] since the array signal vector is unknown due to the unknown location of the source. The ED is formulated assuming that the signal vector is completely unknown. The SD, which is formulated using the matched subspace detection approach [43], exploits the fact that the signal vector belongs to a low-dimensional modal subspace. Subspace detection is a well-discussed problem in the literature [44–46], starting with the works of Scharf and Lytle [44] who applied the theory of invariance in hypothesis testing to the problem of CFAR signal detection. The classic paper by Scharf and Friedlander [43] on matched subspace detection generalized the class of problems for detecting a subspace signal and showed that the GLRT yields a maximal invariant, uniformly most powerful detector. This work has also been extended to the problem of adaptive subspace detection [47–49]. Subspace detection has also been studied for signals in spherically invariant random vector noise [50] and generalized Gaussian noise with interference [51].

In the context of underwater source detection, the SD provides a better performance than the ED. But the SD requires the knowledge of the modal wavenumbers of the underwater channel while the ED does not require any prior information. A modification of the SD, namely the TSD, seeks to optimize the detector by truncating the dimension of the modal subspace. The ED, SD and TSD methods can be employed with either AVS or APS arrays; but AVS arrays provide a significantly better detection performance than APS arrays. The ASFD, which is applicable to AVS arrays only, exploits the fact that a simple approximate relation exists between the components of measurement at each AVS. Neither the ED nor the ASFD assume any knowledge of the channel, but the ASFD provides a better performance than that of the ED. An extension of the above-mentioned detection strategies to the problem of detection in non-Gaussian noise has been explored recently in [52].

This paper presents improved versions of methods developed in [35] for narrowband detection of an acoustic source using an AVS array in a range-independent ocean with Gaussian environmental noise. We undertake a detailed theoretical investigation of these methods, that is missing in [35]. The performance analysis of the detectors is based on several performance measures and simulation studies. We also discuss and illustrate the performance improvement obtained by these detection methods by exploiting the advantages of the AVS array in comparison to the APS array. The paper is organized as follows. The data models for a horizontal linear array (HLA) and a vertical linear array (VLA) of AVS are presented in Section 2. A detailed formulation of several alternative detection strategies is presented in Section 3. The issue of optimization of the TSD is also discussed in this section. In Section 4, the theoretical performance analysis of the detectors is presented for the case of finite data as well as the case of asymptotically large data records, and the relative merits and demerits of the different detectors are discussed. Theoretical and simulation results are presented and compared in Section 5. A summary and conclusions are presented in Section 6.

We consider the problem of using an N-element AVS array for the detection of a narrowband point source with a center frequency f, using T snapshots of data. The ocean is modeled as a range-independent channel, having a water column of density

                      and range r with respect to the reference element of the array. The sensor array is assumed to be in the far-field region with respect to the source, i.e. 
                        2
                        π

                        )

                        1
                     . We consider the uniform HLA and uniform VLA configurations for detection. In the case of an HLA, the sensor closest to the source is considered to be the reference sensor whereas in the case of a VLA the topmost sensor is considered to be the reference. The elements of the array are separated by a uniform distance of d meters. The source azimuth angle is measured with respect to the endfire direction of the HLA and an arbitrary direction for the VLA.

Each AVS in the array has three outputs, viz., the acoustic pressure and two orthogonal horizontal components of particle velocity. The vertical component of particle velocity is not considered since the inclusion of this additional measurement is found to increase the complexity of the detection algorithm without yielding any significant additional improvement in performance. We shall scale the velocity components by the factor

For a source in the far-field region, the contribution of the continuous spectrum can be neglected and the expression for the acoustic pressure

                        t
                        =
                        1
                        ,
                        …

                      at the sensor array are unknown due to lack of knowledge of the source location and other uncertainties in source, receiver or environment parameters. Hence we perform a generalized likelihood ratio test after replacing each vector 
                        
                           s

                        )
                     . The ML estimate may use any prior information that may be available. The different detectors presented in this paper use different types of prior information. The noise variance

                      is also not known in general. Sometimes, it may be possible to obtain a prior estimate of 
                        
                           
                              σ
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      from noise-only data. If a reliable a priori estimate of

                      is not available, it has to be treated as an additional unknown parameter. Hence we shall consider the detection problem for two different cases, viz. (a) the noise variance

                      is known, and (b)

                      is unknown.

For case (a), the logarithm of the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) is obtained from (25) on replacing

                     . Hence the test statistic for this case can be written as

                         are known, the optimal detector in the Neyman–Pearson sense is the replica-correlator which may be implemented as a matched filter detector (MFD) [42]. Even though this case is of little practical interest, we shall consider it solely for the purpose of comparison since the performance of the MFD provides an upper bound on the performance of other realizable detectors. In this case, the log-likelihood ratio in (25) leads to the following likelihood ratio test (LRT): Decide

The GLRT does not provide a meaningful solution if the signal is completely unknown and the noise variance is also unknown.

The ED described in Section 3.2 assumes no prior information about the structure of the signal vector. It is possible to achieve better performance by using any prior information that may be available. One such detector is the subspace detector (SD) [34,35]. This detector is based on the fact that the 3N-dimensional signal vector belongs to an M-dimensional modal subspace. We shall present here a simpler formulation of the subspace detector and its theoretical performance analysis.

We know that the pre-whitened signal vector can be expressed as

The SD method presented in Section 3.3 can be employed only if the columns of 
                           A
                           (
                           ϕ
                           )
                         are linearly independent, i.e. if 
                           M
                           ⩽
                           3
                           N
                        . Since the number of modes M increases as the frequency is increased [53], the applicability of SD is limited by an upper cut-off frequency 
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                         that increases with the number of sensors N; a longer array (larger N) is required for detection of signals of higher frequency. Moreover, it is observed that, for a given array length N, the performance of SD suffers degradation as the signal frequency f is increased even if 
                           f
                           <
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                        . This progressive degradation can be explained by considering the normalized mean-square signal estimation error (NMSE)

The SD and TSD seek to achieve better performance than that of the ED by exploiting the knowledge of the modal wavenumbers. If this information is not available, it is still possible to achieve better detection than that of the ED by using the knowledge of the structure of the vector

                         requires determination of the probability density functions (PDFs) of the test statistic under both hypotheses. The test statistic is defined in (42) for case (a), noise variance known, and in (43) for case (b), noise variance unknown. It is difficult to determine the PDFs since the test statistics are highly nonlinear functions of the data. But we can determine approximate expressions for the PDFs by assuming that the estimate

For case (a) and a given ϕ, the test statistics of the detectors, defined in (32), (42), (59), and (75) are asymptotically (

                         are respectively the signal component of acoustic pressure and the variance of noise at the nth sensor. Only the pressure components of signal and noise are considered in the definition of SNR as per normal convention [20], to facilitate a fair comparison between the performance of AVS and APS (acoustic pressure sensor) arrays. Values of the channel parameters and source coordinates used in this example are the same as those listed in Section 5.

It is known that the number of modes M increases as the frequency is increased. It follows from (99) that both

                         reduce with increasing frequency. We may therefore expect the performance of the SD to degrade as the frequency is increased till M reaches the threshold 3N. For all other detectors, the performance is expected to be independent of frequency. All predictions in the preceding paragraphs will be verified through simulation results presented in Section 5.

If noise variance is not known (case (b)), the test statistics defined in (43), (60) and (76) converge asymptotically to ratios of independent Gaussian random variables with non-zero means. The asymptotic PDFs of the test statistics have complicated expressions which do not provide any useful insights. Therefore, we shall not pursue the asymptotic analysis of case (b).

This section presents a detailed study of the performance of all the detectors. The ocean is modeled as a Pekeris channel [53] comprising a homogeneous water layer of constant depth over a fluid half-space. The following values of channel, source and array parameters have been assumed unless otherwise stated: ocean depth

                      lowest order modes and the SD requires the knowledge of all the modal wavenumbers if an HLA is deployed. If a VLA is used, the SD and TSD require the knowledge of the modal eigenfunctions also, in addition to the modal wavenumbers.

                     . Performance of the unrealizable MFD is also shown to indicate the upper bound on

                      for any realizable detector. It is seen that the asymptotic and non-asymptotic results exhibit the same trend, even though there are some quantitative differences between the two sets of results. Among the realizable detectors, the ranking of HLA-based detectors in decreasing order of performance is TSD, followed by ASFD, SD, and ED. For VLA-based detectors, the order of TSD and ASFD is reversed. These results are consistent with the values of the deflection coefficient δ shown in Table 1 and Fig. 6, and are in conformity with the predictions in Section 4.6. It is noteworthy that the ASFD, that does not require any channel information, compares favorably with the TSD that requires the knowledge of wavenumbers/eigenfunctions of the lowest

                      modes of the channel. The ASFD compensates for the lack of channel information by exploiting the knowledge of an approximate relationship among different components of the signal measured by an AVS. The performance of the SD is poor even though it uses the modal wavenumber/eigenfunction information of all the M modes. This is so because the number of modes M is large and hence the NMSE of the SD is high, which leads to a degradation in performance. The performance of the ED is the poorest because it does not use any prior information.

In Fig. 9
                     , the theoretical (non-asymptotic) results (dashed lines) are compared with simulation results (solid lines). For, SD, TSD and ASFD, two types of simulation results are considered, viz. simulations of realizable detectors that do not assume prior knowledge of the bearing ϕ (solid lines), and simulations of unrealizable detectors which assume that ϕ is known (dotted lines). The variance of noise is assumed to be known (case (a)). The theoretical results are based on the expressions for

                      given in Sections 4.1–4.5. The following observations can be made from Fig. 9. For MFD and ED, the simulation results match the theoretical predictions very closely. In the case of SD, TSD and ASFD, there is very good agreement between theoretical results and the simulation results that are based on the assumption that ϕ is known. But the

                      of the realizable versions of these detectors are significantly lower than the theoretical predictions at low SNR. The difference between theoretical predictions and actual performance can be explained as follows. The theoretical results are based on the assumption that the bearing estimates

                      may be approximated by the true value ϕ. This assumption has been made to simplify the theoretical analysis. But the means and standard deviations of the bearing estimation errors keep increasing as SNR is reduced, as illustrated in Fig. 10
                      which shows the variation of the (a) bias and (b) root-mean-square error of the bearing estimates of the SD, TSD and ASFD with variation in the SNR. Consequently, for SD, TSD and ASFD, the gap between theoretical predictions and actual performance also keeps increasing as SNR is reduced. Even though the theoretical results tend to overestimate the actual performance, the former provide a useful insight into the comparative performance of different detectors.

It is also of interest to compare the performance of HLA-based detectors (Figs. 8(a) and 9(a)) and VLA-based detectors (Figs. 8(b) and 9(b)). It is seen that the performance of an HLA-based detector is better than that of a similar VLA-based detector. One reason for this difference is that noise at the sensors of the HLA is i.i.d., whereas noise at the sensors of the VLA is correlated and it has spatially varying variance. The whitening transformation leads to a reduction of the energy of the VLA signal vector and a consequent reduction in the performance of all VLA-based detectors. In the case of the TSD, there is an additional reason for the better performance of HLA. The optimal value of

                      for the HLA is lower than that for the VLA due to the higher degree of correlation among the modal steering vectors of the HLA. Therefore the NMSE

                      for the VLA is higher than that for the HLA, and the higher NMSE translates into a lower detector performance. Finally, it is seen from Fig. 10 that (1) for SD and TSD, the bearing estimation error of a VLA-based detector is larger than that of a similar HLA-based detector, and (2) for ASFD, the bearing estimation errors of HLA and VLA are almost the same. Therefore, for SD and TSD, the actual differences between the performance of HLA-based and VLA-based detectors (shown in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b)) are larger than the theoretically predicted differences (shown in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b)).

                      causes degradation in performance of all the detectors. But the degradation is less severe in the case of TSD. It is well known that this degradation can be arrested by employing secondary data vectors which are statistically identical to the noise-only data vectors.

We shall now study the variation of detector performance with frequency. Fig. 12

                     . All the other parameters have the values mentioned at the beginning of this section. When 
                        f
                        =

                         Hz
                     , the number of normal modes M is equal to 1, and thus the SD and the TSD are equivalent. As f is increased, M increases and consequently the performance of the SD suffers a progressive degradation. For 
                        f
                        >
                        120
                         Hz
                     , we have

                        6
                     , and hence the performance of the SD dips below that of the ASFD. At 
                        f
                        =
                        398

                        18
                     , and the performance of SD is the same as that of ED. At still higher frequencies M is greater than 3N, and hence the SD cannot be used for detection. The performance of the other detectors does not vary with frequency. These results are in agreement with the predictions at the end of Section 4.6.

In the context of source localization applications, the superiority of AVS arrays over acoustic pressure sensor (APS) arrays has been well established [3,7–23]. It is therefore interesting to compare the detection performance of AVS and APS arrays. Such a comparison is shown in Fig. 13
                     . It is seen from Fig. 13(a) that for the ED, the performance of the 6-sensor AVS HLA is equal to that of the 18-sensor APS HLA. This result can be explained by noting that the performance of the ED depends only on the ENR λ, and that the ENR at an N-sensor AVS array is equal to the ENR at a 3N-sensor APS array. However, in the case of the TSD, the performance of the 6-sensor AVS HLA is slightly better than that of the 18-sensor APS HLA. This difference is attributed to the superior bearing estimation capability of the AVS array due to additional directivity provided by the velocity measurements of the AVS [57]. Better bearing estimation translates into a better estimation of the signal vector and thus a better detection performance. These twin advantages of an AVS array, viz. higher SNR and directivity, over an APS array of the same size N and aperture (
                        =
                        (
                        N
                        −
                        1
                        )
                        d
                      for a uniform linear array) are recognized and documented in the literature on AVS array signal processing [3,57]. The ability of an N-sensor AVS array to attain the same level of performance as a 3N-sensor APS array is a result of great practical interest. In an array-based measurement system, a considerable portion of the cost is related to the construction, deployment and location calibration of sensor packages, and these costs depend on the number of sensor packages deployed [3]. Therefore, a reduction from 3N sensor packages in an APS array to N sensor packages in an AVS array will lead to a significant cost reduction. Moreover, in a towed array system, the drag on the towed array depends on the length of the array [58]. The drag can be reduced considerably if an APS array is replaced by a shorter AVS array.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A detailed investigation of four methods, viz. ED, SD, TSD and ASFD, for narrowband detection of an acoustic source in a range-independent shallow-ocean using an AVS array has been presented in this paper. Expressions for probability of false alarm and probability of detection were derived for the asymptotic case and the finite-data case, and the theoretical predictions were compared with simulation results. The signal vector at the sensor array is not known due to the unknown location of the source. Hence all detectors employ a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) which involves a maximum likelihood estimation of the array signal vector. The ED does not use any model for the array signal vector. The SD and TSD employ models based on the normal mode theory. The ASFD employs a model that exploits the relation between the acoustic pressure and particle velocity at each sensor. Different models lead to different signal-vector estimation errors. Expressions for the normalized mean-square signal estimation error (NMSE) were derived for each detector, and it was shown that there exists a strong negative correlation between the NMSE and the detector performance.

If an HLA is employed, the signal model used by the SD requires the knowledge of all the modal wavenumbers, while the TSD requires the knowledge of wavenumbers of a small number of the lowest order modes. If a VLA is employed, the knowledge of the corresponding mode functions is also required. No channel information is required by the ED and the ASFD. The ASFD exploits the knowledge of an approximate relationship among different components of the signal vector to achieve a significantly better performance than the ED.

Theoretical derivations as well as simulation results indicate that, in the case of an HLA, the best performance is achieved by TSD, followed by ASFD, SD, and ED in that order. These results are consistent with the NMSEs associated with these detectors. In the case of a VLA the performance of TSD and ASFD are very close to one another, and either of them may perform better depending on the values of various parameters. For all the detectors, the performance of the HLA is significantly better than that of the VLA because (1) the HLA provides a better estimate of the bearing of the source, (2) noise at the VLA is spatially correlated whereas it can be assumed to be uncorrelated in the case of an HLA, and (3) in the case of the TSD, the NMSE is lower when used with the HLA than with the VLA, due to a smaller value of 
                        
                           
                              M

                     . TSD, SD, and ED are detection strategies which can be used by both APS and AVS arrays. For a given detector and array size, the performance of an AVS array is significantly better than that of the APS array. The ASFD is a detection strategy that is unique to an AVS array.

The analysis presented in this paper is based on the assumption that the environmental noise is Gaussian. It is known that the assumption of Gaussianity is not valid in all environments. Therefore, it would be of interest to enlarge the scope of the analysis to include non-Gaussian/impulsive noise.
