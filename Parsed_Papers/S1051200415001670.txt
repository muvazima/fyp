                  Radio tomographic imaging (RTI) is a promising technique to localize and track the target without wearing any electronic device. However, the performance of traditional shadowing-based RTI (SRTI) degrades in indoor environments due to the existence of interference links caused by multipath. The interference links can bring false spots in the imaging results of RTI and make the true spot drift, resulting in position estimation error of the target. In this paper, we propose an interference link canceling technique to improve the performance of RTI where temporal and spatial properties of shadowed links are jointly used to detect the interference links. Since the spatial detection relies on the prior knowledge of the position of the target, we use Kalman filter to provide the position estimation. Moreover, a mean-shift clustering method is adopted to obtain the initial position estimation of the target. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed enhanced SRTI (ESRTI) method outperforms the existing methods in terms of both image quality and tracking accuracy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Radio tomographic imaging (RTI) has emerged as an attractive technology to localize the target without attaching any electronic device. So far various schemes of RTI including coherent RTI and non-coherent RTI have been proposed by research community in the past decades [1]. Among them, RTI based on received signal strength (RSS), which is a type of non-coherent RTI, has attracted a lot of attention because RSS can be easily obtained from most wireless communication devices without extra hardware. Thus, RSS-based RTI offers a cost-effective solution to image the monitored area. Recently, RSS-based RTI has been used in a variety of applications including roadside surveillance [2], through-wall sensing [3–6], floor plan formation [5–7], residential monitoring [8] and health care [9].

Shadowing-based RTI (SRTI) was originally proposed by Patwari and Wilson [10] which exploited RSS variation obtained from a network of low-cost radio sensors to generate an attenuation image about the monitored area. The major assumption behind SRTI is that when the target obstructs the wireless links, the links will suffer from large shadowing loss. In addition, the RSS of links which are not blocked by the target will almost keep unchanged. The assumption is valid for open environments where the line-of-sight (LOS) path of a link is dominant. However, it does not hold in cluttered indoor environments due to the existence of multipath which makes RSS change unexpectedly. Diversity has proven to be an effective method to combat the multipath. For example, Kaltiokallio has proposed a channel diversity method which chose the best channel from different channels or weighted them by fading levels [11]. A fade-level based spatial model for RTI was also proposed, which divided the links to fading links and no fading links and treated the two types of links differently [12]. Bocca [13] found that by changing the orientation of antennas, the performance of RTI can be improved dramatically. But diversity requires measuring RSS on different channels or orientations, which results in increased measurement burden. Wei [14] employed electronically switched directional (ESD) antennas which have narrow beamwidth to mitigate the multipath. However, using directional antennas will increase the size and also the cost of radio sensors.

In this paper, we attempt to cope with multipath problem from another perspective of canceling interference links. The interference links refer to the links whose RSS measurements are observed to have unexpected change. For example, the RSS measurements of some links are noticeably increased, which is rarely observed in outdoor environments. In addition, the RSS measurements of some links whose LOS paths are not obstructed also exhibit great attenuation. This may be caused by dominant multipath obstruction or fast fading due to the motion of the target. The participation of interference links will impair the performance of RTI. Specifically, if interference links are used to perform RTI, the image may be severely corrupted by false spots and noise. The true spot corresponding to the position of the target may also drift significantly. Both can result in large position estimation errors.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose to enhance the RTI by interference canceling technique and the proposed method is referred to as enhanced SRTI (ESRTI). In summary, the paper has the following contributions:
                        
                           1)
                           We employ both temporal and spatial properties of shadowed links to detect the interference links. Considering that the RSS of the obstructed links slowly varies, in the temporal domain a moving average filter is utilized to avoid the links corrupted by fast fading. Further, we detect the interference links according to the spatial property where the intersection points of the interference links are far away from the true position of the target. Note that the spatial detection phase requires the position of the target, which is unknown in advance. To tackle this problem, we replace the target's position with the position prediction obtained by Kalman filter. The links excluding interference links are used to generate the image about the monitored area.

Since ESRTI requires that the initial position of the target is known, we propose to estimate the initial position of the target based on mean-shift clustering approach [15].

The effectiveness of ESRTI method is also verified by experiments. We observe that the imaging results given by the proposed ESRTI are considerably enhanced, where the false spots disappear and the localization accuracy is significantly improved.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly review related work about RTI. Section 3 presents the problem formulation of indoor RTI and the motivation of the proposed method. In Section 4, we give the details of the interference link elimination. Section 5 shows how to obtain the initial position of the target. In Section 6, the overall framework of ESRTI method is described. Section 7 validates the effectiveness of the proposed method by field experiments. Section 8 concludes the paper.

Typically, RTI employs a network of distributed radio sensors to image the target in the monitored area. The presence of the target will influence the radio signal in different ways including reflection, scattering and shadowing. The role of radio sensors is to provide the measurement with respect to the received signal. According to the type of metric RTI uses, RTI can be roughly divided into two categories: coherent RTI and non-coherent RTI [1].

Coherent RTI employs the principle of inverse scattering to image the monitored region, which relies on the knowledge of the amplitude and phase of the received signal. Wicks' group has made considerable contributions in the area of coherent RTI including developing a theoretical framework of the coherent RTI [16] and applying RTI to detect deeply buried targets or tunnel [16–18]. Further, Soldovieri [19] utilized RTI to perform through-wall imaging. Monte [20] improved coherent RTI by introducing a more accurate forward model, mitigating the direct-path wave and using a more robust inversion scheme. However, it is noteworthy that coherent RTI requires specialized hardware because most commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices are unable to provide accurate phase measurement. Thus, the system cost of coherent RTI can be high. In order to implement coherent RTI on COTS devices, Qiu [1] proposed a phase reconstruction method to retrieve the phase information from the amplitude-only measurement. Bonior [21] experimentally verified Qiu's method by using COTS devices called Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP). Moreover, Hu [22] proposed a machine learning method to implement noise reduction of the amplitude-only measurement to improve the accuracy of phase reconstruction. However, perfect phase reconstruction strongly relies on accurate amplitude measurement while some COTS devices can only provide rough amplitude measurement, especially for the low cost COTS devices.

Non-coherent RTI also only requires amplitude measurement of the received signal but it does not need to recover the phase. Considering that rough amplitude measurement such as RSS obtained from simple and cheap devices is sufficient for non-coherent RTI, the system cost can be greatly reduced. It should be noted that non-coherent RTI leverages the influence of the target on the direct-path signal rather than the scattered signal. As we have mentioned before, non-coherent RTI was first proposed by Patwari [23], motivated by computerized tomography (CT). Kaltiokallio [11] and Bocca [13] utilized channel diversity and angular diversity to improve the SRTI in cluttered environments. Instead of using attenuation of links, Wilson [3] proposed a variance-based RTI (VRTI) which was free of calibration and also had the capability of seeing through walls. Zhang [24] proposed the subspace VRTI (SubVRTI) method which used subspace decomposition method to reduce the influence of noise and also proposed Kernel RTI (KRTI) method which exploited both attenuation and variance of RSS [25]. Due to the sparsity that the target usually occupies little space compared to the whole monitored area, sparse recovery based on compressive sensing was used to enhance the imaging results of RTI [5,6,26,27] as well. Edelstein [28] proposed a background subtraction method to perform online calibration which obtained the RSS values when the monitored region is empty of target.

In this paper, we focus on non-coherent RTI because of its low cost. In particular, we are interested in SRTI in indoor environments. The major challenge that SRTI encountered in indoor environments is interference links caused by multipath. The interference links can greatly corrupt the formed image of SRTI and bring large localization error of the moving target. In this paper, we employ the temporal and spatial properties of LOS path obstructed links to eliminate interference links. As a result, the performance of proposed ESRTI is remarkably enhanced compared to SRTI.

                      links in the monitored area. The presence of the target can alter the radio environment, leading to variation of RSS. RTI uses the RSS variation of the links to construct an image reflecting the attenuation happened in the monitored area. The brightest spot in the image reveals the position of the target, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b).

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

In outdoor environments like the grassy area where Wilson's experiment was conducted [10], LOS path is strongly dominant. As a consequence, links will ideally behave: the links whose LOS paths are blocked will suffer from large shadowing loss while the RSS of other links are almost unchanged. In other words, there are few interference links in outdoor environments and thus SRTI can perform well. However, for a link in indoor environment, there may exist rich non-LOS paths whose strengths are even stronger than that of LOS path. The multipath will bring some interference links which greatly degrade the performance of SRTI.

As an example, Fig. 2
                         shows the influence of interference links on SRTI. Fig. 2(a) depicts the RSS variation of the links measured in a highly cluttered indoor environment as shown in Fig. 8. We observe that the RSS of some links are attenuated while RSS of some links are enhanced, which are different from the results in [10]. Fig. 2(b) shows the imaging result given by SRTI method. In the image, there are at least 4 bright spots except the true target spot. One of the spots is even brighter than the true target spot.

Interference links mainly come from the two sources: the link whose RSS is remarkably enhanced and the link who observes large attenuation but its LOS path is actually not obstructed by the target. To explain how these two cases happen, Fig. 3
                        (a) and Fig. 3(b) show two scenarios that LOS path is obstructed and unobstructed, respectively. In Fig. 3, we can see that RF signal can travel from transmitting node to receiving node via four propagation paths, where one is the LOS path and the rest three are either reflected or scattered by the objects and target in the monitored area. Note that the assumption is only used to simplify the analysis because the number of paths is actually much more than four in indoor environments.

From Fig. 3, it is shown that the first three propagation paths in the two scenarios are the same. The difference is that the LOS path is blocked by the target in the second scenario. The fourth component resulting from the target's scattering or reflecting is time-varying due to the motion of target. Suppose that the components of the four paths can be represented as

It can be easily deduced that the attenuation of RSS is caused by the following cases:
                           
                              •
                              First, the LOS path is obstructed, which is the most expected case to occur.

Second, the reflection path is blocked by the target, especially when the reflected signal is dominant.

Third, the time-varying component is destructive to the received signal.

The links under the latter two cases are apparently interference links. Unfortunately, we do not know which case it belongs to when a link undergoes large attenuation. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to detect and cancel the interference links by means of temporal method and spatial method.

We first deal with the interference links due to fast fading. Generally speaking, the component reflected by the moving target makes the received signal change rapidly and can be treated as noise. Temporal domain methods, for example, low pass filter can be employed to reduce the noise. The frequently used low pass filter is moving average filter. Suppose that

The window size should be appropriately selected to make a compromise between latency and effectiveness. If the window size is too long, the attenuation is over smoothed while short window size is insufficient to remove the noise.

After passing through the moving average filter, the RSS variation due to fast fading noise is close to 0 dB. In contrast, the RSS variation caused by LOS path or dominant multipath obstruction still exhibits great attenuation. Therefore, we can set a threshold to exclude the interference links caused by fast fading, that is, link l will be regarded as an attenuated link if

                      as the attenuated link set at time instant t. We know that the interference links in the attenuated link set are now mainly non-LOS obstruction links. If the position of the target is known, the non-LOS obstruction links can be detected because the target is not located on the LOS path of those links. In fact, from imaging result at the previous time instant, we can predict the position estimation of target at current time instant, which enables us to perform spatial detection.

We use Kalman filter to predict the position of the target. For simplicity, we suppose that the target moves in the monitored area with a constant velocity (CV) [30]. Readers can refer to [30] for more details if the target owns other types of movement. The dynamic equation of CV model can be given by

                      will also appear, which are unrelated to the position of the target. That is why there are false spots in the resulting image. Therefore, we can divide the intersection points into two groups, namely, normal points and outliers, where normal points correspond to the true spot in the image and outliers correspond to the false spots.

As we have mentioned, the target will only shadow the nearby links. Therefore, the true position of the target should not be far away from the normal points, as shown in Fig. 4. As we have obtained the position estimation of the target from Kalman filter, a normal point

If the distance between intersection point and the target's predicted position exceeds the threshold, the intersection point should be treated as outlier. The link which only contains outliers is deemed to be interference link and the link contains at least one normal point will be regarded as the shadowed link. Thus, we get a new link set

                     , which includes the links after spatial detection. If this link set is used to implement RTI, the majority of the false bright spots on the image will be canceled.

Sometimes, the number of links in the set

                      is less than two, which does not reach the minimum number of links required to complete an image. It means that we cannot get the correct position observation from RTI. One approach to handle this problem is to stop imaging at the current time instant and continue from the next time instant.

In this section, we will discuss the initialization of target state in Kalman filter. Usually the velocity state of target can be simply initialized with 0. However, the initialization of the position state

                              x
                           
                           
                              t
                           
                        
                        ,
                        
                           
                              y
                           
                           
                              t
                           
                        
                        )
                      of target is critical to the feasibility of spatial detection. If the initial position estimation from Kalman filter is far from the true one, the link set obtained by spatial detection may not be correct. Thus, it is significant to get the initial position of the target.

At the initial time instant, suppose that we have obtained the attenuated link set 
                        
                           
                              ℓ

                      and the intersection point set 
                        
                           
                              ρ
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                     . The links in 
                        
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                      should also be divided into shadowed links and non-shadowed links. Only shadowed links can provide useful information about the position of the target.


                     Fig. 5
                      shows the attenuated link set and the corresponding intersection points. As we have mentioned, the normal points are close to each other, which is very similar to a cluster centered at the position of the target. While the outliers are randomly distributed in the monitored area and most of them are far from the center of the cluster. If we can find the cluster centered at the position of the target, it is easy to obtain the initial position of the target. Thus, the problem of initial position estimation becomes the finding of a closely neighbored intersection point set π, satisfying

The procedure is very similar to clustering in a 2-D plane. Thus, we adopt the mean-shift algorithm [15] to partition the point set into several groups to find the desired set. Mean-shift algorithm is a well-known clustering or mode seeking method, which does not require the prior knowledge of the number of the clusters nor the shape of the cluster.

After clustering has completed, we need to choose one cluster to be the normal point set. In general, the normal point set has the maximum number of points because the outliers are usually isolated and thus hard to form a cluster with lots of points. Therefore, the normal point set and the initial position estimation are given by

Tikhonov regularization [10,33,34] is efficient to cope with the ill-posed problem, which aims to minimize the following objective function

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

In this section we describe our experiment which uses the method proposed in this paper. Section 7.1 provides a detailed description of experimental setup. This section is followed by the experimental results with evaluation and comparison in Section 7.2.

In this experiment, we use 16 TI CC2530 nodes which can provide quantized RSS with range from 0 to 255. The nodes operate at 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band, which specifies 16 channels numbered from 11 to 26. We use the No. 11 channel in this experiment. In order to obtain RSS of the links in real time, we use the same token ring protocol as adopted in [10]. In the protocol, each node is assigned a unique ID. At one time instant, node with ID i broadcasts a packet and other nodes receive the packet and measure the RSS. At next moment, node with ID 
                           i
                           +
                           1
                         broadcasts a packet and other nodes measure the RSS of the received the packet. When node with ID 
                           i
                           =
                           16
                         has finished transmitting the packet, the RSS of all the links can be updated once. Next time instant node with ID 1 begins to send the packet again. The RSS samples are sent to the fusion node which connects to the local computer via USB port.

The 16 nodes are placed counterclockwise in terms of their IDs in an office which is a typical multipath-rich environment, as shown in Fig. 8
                        . There are walls, desks, chairs, and other objects in the office room. All these objects can reflect or scatter the radio signal. The nodes are fixed on the tripods to keep the same height with the other nodes, as shown in Fig. 8. These nodes surround a monitored area with 
                           4.8

                           =
                           23.04
                            
                           
                              
                                 m
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        .

Before the target enters the monitored area, the RSS of each link is averaged by at least 5000 samples to reduce the noise and interference outside the area. Then we get the calibration value of RSS of each link. The calibration procedure can also be performed online (see [4,28]).

To evaluate the position error of the proposed method, a person moves at walking speed around 0.6 m/s along the predefined trajectory. Meanwhile, the nodes measure the RSS and send the measurements to the local computer. In the experiment, we test a trajectory with a rectangular shape, as shown in Fig. 9
                        . After receiving the RSS, the local computer outputs the imaging results and position estimates of the target.

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

The values of parameters mentioned in this paper are listed in Table 1
                           . Fig. 10
                            shows the imaging results at time instants 20, 33, 77, 98 using the proposed ESRTI and SRTI, respectively. Each image has 
                              48
                              ×
                              48
                            pixels. We can see that the imaging results of SRTI are greatly affected by noise, coming from the interference links. In these images, in addition to the target spot, there are other false bright spots. In time instant 33, the false spot is even brighter than the target spot, which means significant localization error at this moment.

In contrast, the imaging results obtained by the proposed method are much better than those obtained by SRTI. We can see that the brightest spot is very close to the true position of the target. Moreover, almost no other bright spots appear in these images. That is because the proposed method has excluded the interference links, which makes the reconstructed images greatly enhanced.

ESRTI is essentially a joint target imaging and tracking method. In the above subsection, we have explored the imaging performance of ESRTI. In this subsection, it is necessary to discuss the tracking performance enhancement of ESRTI compared to SRTI. In addition, the tracking results of other types of RSS-based non-coherent RTI such as SubVRTI [24] and KRTI [25] are also presented for examining their performance in our experimental environment. Note that SRTI, SubVRTI and KRTI typically do not include the tracking part, the Kalman filter is augmented to obtain the tracking results of those methods. The parameters of Kalman filter for SRTI, SubVRTI and KRTI are the same with ESRTI, as shown in Table 1.


                           Fig. 11
                            shows the estimated trajectories obtained by SubVRTI, KRTI, SRTI and ESRTI, respectively. We can see that the tracking performance of KRTI, SRTI and ESRTI are much better than those of SubVRTI. The reason behind this is that SubVRTI employs the variance of RSS due to the presence of the target. In fact, in our experimental environment, the attenuation of RSS is more dramatic than the variance of RSS when the link is blocked by the target. Thus, SubVRTI might be suitable for the scenarios where the LOS path of the link does not exist, such as through-wall scenarios. For KRTI and SRTI, we can observe that there are large localization errors at some positions in Fig. 11(c), compared to Fig. 11(d). It occurs because the interference links make the position estimation drift significantly. However, ESRTI yields a much smoother estimated trajectory than SRTI.


                           Fig. 12
                            shows the tracking error of the four methods over time. For SubVRTI, the tracking errors are usually larger than 0.4 m for most time instants. In contrast, the tracking errors of KRTI, SRTI and ESRTI are less than 0.4 m. Also, we observe that at time instants from 18 to 28 the tracking error of SRTI is much larger than the one of ESRTI.


                           Fig. 13
                            shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of tracking error with the aforementioned four methods. CDF is defined as the probability that tracking error is lower than a certain level. There is a significant performance gap between the CDFs of SRTI and ESRTI. We can see that 90% of tracking error of the proposed ESRTI method is lower than 0.32 m, while 90% of tracking error of SRTI method is lower than 0.49 m.

The most frequently used metric for evaluating tracking performance is root-mean-square error (RMSE), defined as

                            is the total number of time instants. From Fig. 11, we can calculate RMSEs of the SubVRTI, KRTI, SRTI and ESRTI, which are 0.52 m, 0.43 m, 0.41 m and 0.23 m, respectively. The tracking accuracy of the proposed ESRTI is improved by about 44% compared to SRTI.

We know that the feasibility of ESRTI closely depends on the initial position estimation given by mean-shift clustering method. To examine the localization accuracy of mean-shift clustering method, we present localization results at all instants using mean-shift clustering method, which are shown in Fig. 14
                           . We can see that at most instants, the mean-shift clustering method can produce good position estimation of the target. However, at some instants, the position estimation results given by mean-shift clustering have large localization errors. It is not hard to imagine that if the target starts moving from those positions, ESRTI method will not work effectively. By comparing Fig. 11(c) and Fig. 14, we can see the larger localization error occurs when there are many interference links. Recall that mean-shift clustering method employs the attenuated links without spatial detection and thus many interference links still exist. Also, we assume that the center of largest cluster can be seen as the position estimation. Therefore, if there are many interference links, the mean-shift clustering will find the wrong cluster constituted by outliers, resulting in large localization error.

The performance of ESRTI is closely related to the output of Kalman filter because the link canceling procedure requires Kalman filter providing the position prediction of the target. In this paper, we use CV model [30] to describe the motion of the target. However, in practical scenarios, the target generally does not strictly follow the CV model. Note that CV model has two important parameters of acceleration noise, i.e.,

                                    x
                                 
                              
                            and 
                              
                                 
                                    σ

                           , which represent the discrepancy between the true target's motion and the CV model.

We next explore the the influence of the mismatch between the target's true dynamic and CV model on the performance of ESRTI. Considering that the acceleration of a person in the experiment is around 1, we artificially vary the motion parameters

                           . Note that the values of

                            are too large, the RMSE of ESRTI increases because large values will make the output of Kalman filter has large noise, which results in inaccurate link canceling. However, when

                            are very small, the performance of ESRTI also degrades because the person's motion in our experiment does not strictly follow the CV model. For example, the person changes direction at the corner of the ground truth, as shown in Fig. 9. It is also shown that when

                           , which is a wide range of dynamic for a human being, the RMSE of ESRTI tends to be unchanged. That means, if the choice of parameters does not have a wide disparity with target's dynamic, the performance of ESRTI is almost unaffected.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In indoor environments, due to multipath effect, there exist many interference links whose RSS varies unexpectedly in the presence of the target. The interference links will cause a degraded imaging result of SRTI. To cope with this problem, we propose the interference link canceling technique which employs both the temporal and spatial properties of the shadowed links. Moreover, we adopt the mean-shift clustering algorithm to obtain the initial position estimation of the target. After eliminating the interference links, the imaging results are greatly improved. We conduct experiments in an office environment to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The imaging results obtained by the proposed method are much cleaner than those obtained by SRTI which have many false spots in the image. In addition, the tracking RMSE of the proposed method is also improved by 44% compared to SRTI in our experiment.
