                  Rational Bézier curves provide a curve fitting tool and are widely used in Computer Aided Geometric Design, Computer Aided Design and Geometric Modeling. The injectivity (one-to-one property) of rational Bézier curve as a mapping function is equivalent to the curve without self-intersections. We present a geometric condition on the control polygon which is equivalent to the injectivity of rational Bézier curve with this control polygon for all possible choices of weights. The proof is based on the degree elevation and toric degeneration of rational Bézier curve.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The rational Bézier curves/patches are widely used in Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD), Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Geometric Modeling as the curve/surface fitting tool because of their precisely representation of the conics and preservation of good properties. The shape of rational Bézier curve can be adjusted by its control polygon and weights. The basic properties and algorithms for the rational Bézier curve are illustrated in Farin’s book [1] and paper [2].

As is well-known, the self-intersection of rational Bézier curve leads to bad influence in the offsets design of the curve [3,4]. In [5], Hoffmann mentioned that the intersection problem has become a fundamental problem in solid modeling systems and the integration of geometric objects. As a mapping function, the injectivity (one-to-one property) of rational Bézier curve is equivalent to the curve without self-intersections.

In 1989, Lasser [3] proposed a curve-curve algorithm to calculate the self-intersection of Bézier curve by subdividing the control polygon of the curve using the de Casteljau algorithm. This method needs to check the possibility of the curve with the self-intersection by the sum of the rotation angles of control polygon before the algorithm begins. Tiller and Hanson [4] presented an algorithm to calculate the self-intersections of B-spline curve. Unfortunately, their methods may fail to the Bézier curve because the Bézier curve may have no self-intersection though the sum of the rotation angles is bigger than 
                        
                           π
                        
                     . On the other hand, the Bézier curve may have self-intersections though its control polygon without self-intersections actually. For the 2D and 3D surface patches, many papers studied on the conditions which imply the injectivity of the patches. In 1996, Goodman and Unsworth [6] proposed a sufficient condition for the injectivity of a 2D Bézier function. For the control points of a

                      linear inequalities. For image morphing, Choi and Lee [7] presented a sufficient condition for the injectivity of 2D and 3D uniform cubic B-spline functions. Their condition provides a single bound for the displacements of control points that guarantees the injectivity of the cubic B-spline function.


                     Fig. 1
                      shows three rational planar cubic Bézier curves with their control polygons. According to the Lasser’s method [3], the curve in Fig. 1(a) may have self-intersections. On the contrary, we claim that the curve has no self-intersection with any positive weights in accordance with Theorem 3. The curve in Fig. 1(b) has one point of self-intersection, which may be removed by varying the weights as shown in Fig. 1(c). Geometrically, there is no self-intersection of the control polygon of the first curve while the others have. And we can learn from the variation diminishing property of rational Bézier curve that the shape of control polygon implies the shape of curve. This brings us a question: Does no self-intersection of control polygon of rational Bézier curve imply no self-intersection of the curve? The answer is NO. For example, the curve in Fig. 10(b) has one point of self-intersection while there is no self-intersection of its control polygon. We will explain the reason in this paper.

In 2008, Craciun et al. [8] gave a geometric condition on the control points which implies that the resulting toric Bézier patch has no self-intersection with any choice of positive weights. Unfortunately, there is a minor flaw in the result cause it only guarantees the injectivity in the interior of the patch. Sottile and Zhu corrected that flaw for 2D patches in [9]. Recently, Zhu et al. [10] presented a geometric condition on control polygons to study the injectivity of planar rational Bézier curve.

The cited works provided conditions which imply no self-intersection. Our purpose of this paper is different and proves the stronger result. We give a geometric condition on control polygons which implies the injectivity of the spatial rational Bézier curve for arbitrary positive weights.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall the definition of rational Bézier curve and geometric property of its toric degeneration. In Section 3, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for the injectivity of rational Bézier curve for arbitrary positive weights, and some representative examples are illustrated.

In this section, we recall the classical definition of rational Bézier curve and its equivalent definition derived from Krasauskas’ toric surface patches [11]. To define geometric condition on the control polygon properly, we also recall the basic theory of the toric degeneration of rational Bézier curve (geometric meaning of control curves) presented by García-Puente et al. [12].

There is a fair amount of literature studied on rational Bézier curves. We just cite a few: Farin [1] and Davis [13]. They presented the properties and basic theory of rational Bézier curves. The following definition and degree elevation property, we refer to those books.

In 2002, Krasauskas [11] presented a new method to construct the multi-sided surface patches, named toric patches. The mathematical theory of toric patches is based on toric variety from Algebraic Geometry and toric ideals from Combinatorics. The classical tensor-product and triangular Bézier patches are the special cases of toric patches. If the parametric domain is one-dimensional, then the toric patch degenerates to the rational Bézier curve.

By Remark 1, a toric Bézier curve can be reparametrized as a rational Bézier curve. This means the definition of toric Bézier curve is equivalent to the definition of rational Bézier curve. For convenience of analysis, we will use curves defined in (2.4) to represent rational Bézier curve in this paper. For higher dimensions, the toric Bézier basis and toric patches can be defined in the same way.

In [10], a geometric condition on the control polygon to study the injectivity of planar rational Bézier curve is presented. In this paper, we prove a stronger result. We give a geometric condition on the control polygon whose definition is equivalent to the injectivity of every rational Bézier curve with this control polygon for all possible choices of positive weights.

The proof for the sufficiency is simple. Suppose the control polygon of a rational Bézier curve is well-posed. From [14], the degree elevation of rational Bézier curve cannot increase the number of self-intersections of control polygon. Note that the condition (b) in Definition 3 is equivalent to the condition that there exists

                            of this control polygon is empty. This means the control polygon preserves the well-posedness after the degree elevation. Fig. 6
                            shows the degree elevation procedure for some rational Bézier curves. From Theorem 1, the limit of sequence of the control polygons generated by the degree elevation is the rational Bézier curve. This means the curve has no self-intersection and completes the proof.


                     Theorem 3 gives a geometric condition for checking the injectivity of rational Bézier curve for arbitrary positive weights. Actually, it is not easy to check the well-posedness of the control polygon by computer using Definition 3 if n is large. As is well known, the barycentric coordinate method is used to construct the Bézier simplices (refer to [1,15,16]). For a point

In 1989, Lasser [3] claimed that if the sum of the rotation angles of the control polygon 
                        
                           ∑
                           |

                                 k

                           π
                        
                     , then the Bézier curve may have self-intersections. By this claim, there may exist self-intersections for the Bézier curve defined by the control polygon as Fig. 11
                     (a) shown. However, by Theorem 3, we can declare that the rational Bézier curve with this control polygon has no self-intersection for arbitrary positive weights because it is well-posed (see Fig. 11(a) for instance).


                     Corollary 1 gives the existence of the weights such that the rational Bézier curve has self-intersections if the control polygon is non-well-posed. For practical application, it is important to solve the calculation of the weights such that the curve defined by a non-well-posed control polygon has self-intersections is a very important problem. And a key step is to determine the distance between the curve and its control polygon. Nairn et al. [17] and Karavelas et al. [18] provided a method to estimate the distance between the polynomial Bézier curve and its control polygon. They firstly parameterize the control polygon, and then estimate the distance between the curve and the control polygon by the parametrization of the curve and the second-order difference of the control polygon. However, the parametrization of rational Bézier curve varies during the toric degeneration of the curve, then the method proposed in [17,18] is not suitable for solving this problem. Note that if the control polygon is non-well-posed, there are too many choices of weights such that rational Bézier curve has self-intersections. Therefore, for the given curve (given control polygon and weights), how to check whether rational Bézier curve has self-intersections or not is another complicated problem. The knowledge from Geometric Combinatorics may be found useful in the process of checking, such as the results of regular triangulation in [19] for instance.

From the proof of the Theorem 3, a simple method to calculate the weights is provided. For the non-well-posed control polygon
