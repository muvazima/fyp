                  To date, comparative statics effects analyzed in the context of expected utility depend on the decision-maker’s utility function. This paper presents a methodology that allows comparative statics effects to be obtained independent of the utility function for a general family of problems. In other words, we provide a set of conditions under which all decision-makers act the same way. Such a methodology can be applied to relevant problems in the related literature, such as the portfolio choice and the competitive firm under price uncertainty (with or without the existence of a forward/futures market). With regards to such specific cases, we show and analyze the most relevant effects produced by the variation of two or more parameters, regardless of the decision-maker’s preferences and attitude towards risk. Some of these effects are illustrated numerically.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the literature on decision-making there are several authors who model choice under risk by relying on the assumption of expected utility (EU) maximization. Amongst these authors, we can cite the seminal papers by Arrow (1963; 1965; 1971), on the optimal portfolio composition; Sandmo (1971), on the production-related decisions made by the competitive firm under uncertainty; and Feder (1977), on the problem of hiring under uncertainty. In Lippman and McCall (1981), we can find a good sample of classic models based on this same assumption. We can also cite more recent works such as those by Eeckhoudt, Gollier, and Schlesinger (1995) and Sévi (2010) on the single-period newsvendor problem; Choi and Ruszczyński (2011), on the multi-product newsvendor problem; Müller (2000), on the optimal stopping problem; Dalal and Alghalith (2009), on the firm under multiple uncertainty sources; Alghalith (2010), on methodological studies; Andersen and Nielsen (2013), on sports economics; and Rodríguez-Puerta and Álvarez-López (2014), on optimal allocation.

One of the studies that can be conducted on the above-mentioned models is the comparative statics analysis. This method, proposed by Samuelson (1941), may be approached in a simplified way (for one variable) by considering an unknown variable x whose equilibrium value is to be determined for preassigned values of a parameter y. We assume the following continuously differentiable implicit relation involving the unknown variable and the parameter:

                        
                           (1)
                           
                              
                                 ϕ
                                 (
                                 x
                                 ,
                                 y
                                 )
                                 =
                                 0
                                 .
                              
                           
                        
                     If, for a given value of 
                        
                           y
                           =
                           
                              y
                              0
                           
                           ,
                        
                      there exists a solution x
                     * to (1), and if ϕx
                     (x
                     *, y
                     0) ≠ 0, then by the implicit-function theorem
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        The implicit-function theorem for one dependent variable and one equation can be seen, for instance, in Theorem 3.2.1 in Krantz and Parks (2013).
                      there exists a continuously differentiable function ψ in a sufficiently small neighborhood I of y
                     0 such that 
                        
                           
                              x

                           ψ
                           
                              (
                              
                                 y
                                 0
                              
                              )
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           ϕ
                           (
                           ψ
                           (
                           y
                           )
                           ,
                           y
                           )

                      for all y ∈ I. In the comparative statics analysis, the objective is to determine the sign of:

                                          *

                                 =
                                 
                                    ψ
                                    ′
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    
                                       y
                                       0
                                    
                                    )
                                 
                                 ,
                              
                           
                        
                     which is the instantaneous rate of change of x
                     * with respect to y
                     0. Thus, if the sign is positive, then this means that if an infinitesimally small change in the parameter y occurs starting from its initial value y
                     0, then an increase in the equilibrium value of x
                     * will also occur. Conversely, if the sign is negative, then an infinitesimally small change in y will produce a reduction in x
                     *. Moreover, (2) represents a quantitative approximation of the variation produced, and the smaller the variation in the parameter, the more accurate the approximation would be.

In the EU models, the derivative that results in (2) depends on the decision-maker’s utility function. Thanks to the Arrow–Pratt measure (Arrow, 1965 and Pratt, 1964), this fact allows the analysis to be performed according to the different types of risk behavior. Nevertheless, due to this dependency on the utility function, the analysis is usually approached from a qualitative perspective, i.e., the study focuses on obtaining the sign of the derivative rather than the variation magnitude. In addition, dependency on the utility function, which is absolutely essential for the theoretical analysis of the model, makes it difficult for the model to be applied to empirical studies. The reason for this difficulty is that it becomes necessary to make a number of assumptions related to the decision-maker’s utility function, such as the type of function and the parameters involved. Although, in practice, different types of functions have been used, the majority of authors tend to use a decision-maker with a utility function that exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA), as stated by Pratt (1964) and Arrow (1965). The most frequently used set of functions in the literature is that of the power utility functions, which exhibits DARA and constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). However, even if we assume a utility function of this type, it is still necessary to make assumptions on the parameter involved (the degree of relative risk aversion). Certain authors, such as Arrow (1971), Friend and Blume (1975), Hansen and Singleton (1982; 1984), Mehra and Prescott (1985) and Brown and Gibbons (1985), have made estimations of this parameter and have obtained different ranges for each case (a summary of some of these results, and others, can be seen in Aït-Sahalia & Lo, 2000). To avoid the problem of implementation of the utility function, other authors have used methods, such as mean-variance (MV) analysis, which is a good approximation of EU maximization (Markowitz, 2014).

Thus, under the assumption of EU maximization, in general, it is difficult to measure the effect of the variation of a parameter because of its dependency on the utility function. Nevertheless, if the simultaneous variation of two parameters is considered, either this effect or the part of the effect depending on the utility function of one of the two parameters may be compensated by the presence of the other. Such research, which has yet to be conducted, would allow both theoretical and empirical conclusions to be obtained with no need to make any assumptions on the utility function and its parameters involved. In addition, not only would a qualitative assessment of the change in the equilibrium value be made possible, but also its quantitative assessment. In this paper, this analysis is performed by using a general model that includes a number of important models in the literature.

The paper is structured as shown below. In Section 2, we show the comparative statics analysis that allows the effect of the simultaneous variation of two or more parameters to be studied. In Section 3, a general decision model under EU maximization is presented. In Section 4, we develop a methodology that allows us to attain comparative statics effects, which are independent of the utility function. In Section 5, we include a number of applications of the methodology used in three different models in the literature, and the most relevant effects attained are analyzed. In Section 6, we numerically illustrate some of these effects. Finally, concluding remarks are made in Section 7.

In this section, the comparative statics analysis, formalized by Samuelson (1941) to study the effect produced on the equilibrium value due to the variation of one single parameter, is extended in order to study the effect of the simultaneous variation of two or more parameters.

The first model with this structure that we have found in this field is the seminal model proposed by Sandmo (1971). Since then, many authors have changed this model by considering, for instance, a source of uncertainty different from the price, such as the output (see Dalal & Alghalith, 2009) or the demand (see Leland, 1972 and Coes, 1977); or new decision-making variables, such as the firm’s hedge level (see Holthausen, 1979) or new parameters, such as the price of inputs (see Dalal, 1990). Other authors have considered that the firm’s goal is not to maximize its profit but to maximize the EU of income per worker (see Bughin, 1995; Feder, 1977; Hey, 1981; and Muzondo, 1979). Other models with this same structure exist in other areas of research, such as the portfolio choice, amongst which the seminal model by Arrow (1963; 1965; 1971) should be mentioned, and the portfolio model with tax rates by Diamond and Stiglitz (1974). Recently in the area of sports economics, Andersen and Nielsen (2013) have studied a specific model of firm under uncertainty. Rodríguez-Puerta and Álvarez-López (2014) have also studied another specific model of a firm under uncertainty, in this case concerning the problem of optimal allocation.

In the previous general problem, comparative statics can be studied according to each of the parameters yi
                      (1 ≤ i ≤ n), μ and σ. For this purpose, we calculate the derivative of (12) with respect to both x and each of these parameters. The resulting derivatives are evaluated at the optimum:

By replacing (17)–(19) in Eq. (20), the left-hand side of Eq. (20) can be grouped into three different addends: a first addend containing the factor M, a second addend containing the factor N, and a third addend containing neither of them. In order to ensure that Eq. (20) is independent of u, we impose that the first two addends are equal to zero and the third addend is equal to β, i.e.:

                                     means that we assume that the wealth q of the agent and the rate of return r of the risk-free asset remain unchanged from the initial to the final situation. In addition, as β ≠ 0, we assume that the risky asset undergoes changes in both the expected value μ and the standard deviation σ.

This involves the existence of some specific changes in the parameters under which the optimal amount remains roughly invariant for all agents, regardless of their utility function.

We consider a firm that must make a decision on its level of output x before knowing the price for which the product will be sold on the market. This price is modeled by a random variable P defined by 
                           
                              P
                              =
                              μ
                              +
                              σ
                              ϵ
                           
                         with an expected value μ and standard deviation σ. The firm faces some fixed costs given by b, and some variable costs dependent on both the level of output and the prices of the inputs necessary for the output. In order to simplify, we will assume two inputs, at prices w
                        1 and w
                        2, and the variable cost function will be denoted c(x) instead of c(x, w
                        1, w
                        2).

                           Corollary 3 shows that, if there is a specific proportional relationship between the increase (decrease) in the prices of the inputs and the increase (decrease) in the firm’s fixed costs (the rest of parameters and variables of the model remain invariant), then the firm’s optimal level of output does not vary, regardless of the firm’s preferences and attitude towards risk.


                        Holthausen (1979) analyzes the model of a competitive firm facing a stochastic market price P (of expected value μ and standard deviation σ) for its single output q. It can either sell its output at the random market price or sell it on a forward/futures market at a certain price b. Let x denote the amount of output hedged in the forward/futures market. Output is produced at a cost of c(q), with c′(q) > 0 and c′′(q) ≠ 0. Under this hypothesis, the firm’s profit is given by:

Although the Holthausen model has two decision-making variables and the general model (8) proposed has just one single variable, this fact does not impede the application of the methodology described, as we can see below:

The first-order conditions necessary to obtain an interior solution for this optimization problem are as follows:

We will assume that the second-order sufficient condition is verified. In other words, there is an interior optimal solution (q
                        *, x
                        *) for the previous problem.

It is known that, by operating with (43) and (44), we obtain 
                           
                              
                                 c

                                 (
                                 q
                                 )
                              
                              =

                         i.e., the optimal level of output is the amount for which marginal cost equals forward/future price b. Therefore, in practice, the Holthausen model can be separated into two different problems. The first problem is independent of u, and consists of determining q
                        * so that:

                        The second problem consists—once q
                        * is determined—of calculating x so that the EU of profit is maximized. From now on, we will consider q to be the firm’s optimal level of output by verifying (45), and the problem will be minimized as follows:

                        This is a relationship that considers variations in μ and σ but not in the other parameters. From (49) we obtain the following proposition by proceeding in a similar way to that in the previous models.

In other words, if the excess of the spot price (over the forward/future price), as a random variable, increases (decreases) by a given percentage, then the firm will decrease (increase) the amount invested in the spot market by the same percentage, independent of the firm’s utility function.

In this section, in order to illustrate the approximation of the optimal solution derived in this paper, we will conduct a simulation study. Since the models of a firm under uncertainty analyzed in this paper depend on a cost function for which a specific functional form should be assumed, in order to conduct this simulation study we will take the standard portfolio model, which is easier to implement. We will compare this approximation with two different cases that are also easy to carry out. In the first case, the agent exhibits constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) with utility function 
                        
                           u

                              t
                              )

                      (k > 0), and the probability distribution of random variable Z is normal. In the second case, the agent has a quadratic utility function 
                        
                           u

By operating as shown in Rodríguez-Puerta and Álvarez-López (2014), the optimal solution of (24) has the following exact expression in each of the two cases considered:

                      shows this estimation according to the different values of δ as well as the error made in comparison with cases (50) and (51).

Taking the same optimal initial value observed in the initial period, let us now assume that, in a subsequent period, the wealth the investor obtains for each of the monetary units invested in the risk-free asset increases by a percentage given by δ and his/her initial wealth decreases by the same percentage, i.e.,

                              )

                              1
                              −
                              δ
                              )

                           =
                           
                              q
                              0
                           
                           
                              (

                              δ
                              )
                           
                        
                     . Therefore, according to the approximation given by (37), as long as the expected excess return remains invariant, the agent will continue investing the same amount in the risky asset, as shown in Table 2
                     . In this case, we observe that the error made with respect to the CARA case is equal to 0. This occurs because the error depends on constant values (σ, k, q
                     0 and 
                        
                           x
                           0

                     ) and also on the difference 
                        
                           μ
                           −
                           r

                      which is assumed to remain invariant.

In this paper, we prove that it is possible to obtain comparative statics effects independent of the utility function in a general family of problems if we consider the simultaneous variation of two or more parameters. This general approach is applied to three different models in the literature: the standard portfolio model; the competitive firm under price uncertainty; and hedging and the competitive firm under price uncertainty. In all three models, we obtain different comparative statics effects independent of the decision-maker’s preferences and attitude towards risk. The main results for these specific models can be summarized as follows:


                     The standard portfolio model.
                     
                        
                           •
                           If the excess return, as a random variable, increases (decreases) by a given percentage, then the amount invested in the risky asset will decrease (increase) by approximately the same percentage.

If the percentage decrease (increase) in the wealth obtained by the investor for each monetary unit invested in the risk-free asset coincides with the percentage increase (decrease) in his/her initial wealth, with the excess return remaining invariant as a random variable, then this investor will continue investing approximately the same amount in the risky asset.


                     The competitive firm under price uncertainty.
                     
                        
                           •
                           If there is a specific proportional relationship between the increase (decrease) in the prices of the inputs and the increase (decrease) in the firm’s fixed costs (with the rest of parameters and variables of the model remaining invariant), then, approximately, the firm’s optimal level of output will not vary.


                     Hedging and the competitive firm under price uncertainty.
                     
                        
                           •
                           If the excess of the spot price (over the forward/future price), as a random variable, increases (decreases) by a given percentage, then the firm will decrease (increase) the amount invested in the spot market by approximately the same percentage.

Although the general model proposed in this paper encompasses many of the models in the literature, there still remain a few other models that have yet to be included in our framework. Thus, this paper provides a new direction for future research on comparative statics effects independent of the utility function in these other models. In addition, the effects obtained depend on the parameters considered, and hence new relationships may be obtained if additional parameters are added to the models herein analyzed.
