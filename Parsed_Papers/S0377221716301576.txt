                  The paper suggests a differential game of advertising competition among three symmetric firms, played over an infinite horizon. The objective of the research is to see if a cooperative agreement among the firms can be sustained over time. For this purpose the paper determines the characteristic functions (value functions) of individual players and all possible coalitions. We identify an imputation that belongs to the core. Using this imputation guarantees that, in any subgame starting out on the cooperative state trajectory, no coalition has an incentive to deviate from what was prescribed by the solution of the grand coalition’s optimization problem.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A seminal paper in the literature dealing with the design of a firm’s optimal advertising strategy is Nerlove and Arrow (1962) who argued that a firm’s advertising efforts could be seen as an investment in a particular asset, viz., a stock of advertising goodwill held by a firm 
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Later on, advertising goodwill has also been referred to as “advertising capital”, “brand image”, or “brand equity”.
                     . The goodwill stock can be built up by expending money on advertising, but is subject to decay if advertising expenditures are insufficient. The Nerlove–Arrow model may be seen as a reinterpretation of the neoclassical capital accumulation model of Ramsey (1928), letting the stock of advertising goodwill play the role of a stock of physical capital.

The Nerlove–Arrow model have been extended to multi-firm settings. Fershtman (1984) studied a straightforward extension of the Nerlove–Arrow model to an oligopolistic market. Subsequent research has extended the model of Nerlove and Arrow in many directions and employed it in new settings. This literature is surveyed in, e.g., Huang, Leng, and Liang (2012); Jørgensen and Zaccour (2004).

A main difference between the current research and earlier studies of goodwill (or physical capital) accumulation lies in the objectives of the firms operating in the market. The literature has focused on noncooperative games played by oligopolistic firms that act individually and in their own best interest. No cooperation or sharing of information takes place. The aim of our research is to study intertemporal cooperation among oligopolists. More specifically, the paper

                        
                           •
                           characterizes the advertising strategies that are prescribed for the firms when they act in a cooperative and coordinated way, with the purpose of maximizing industry profits.

shows how a cooperative agreement can be sustained over time, in the sense that no single firm or coalition of firms has an incentive to deviate from its part of the agreement as the game proceeds along the trajectory that is prescribed for the grand coalition
                                 2
                              
                              
                                 2
                                 The grand coalition is a cartel consisting of all firms in the market.
                              .

Some studies in the area of noncooperative games also characterize the solution to the industry profit maximization problem and may also suggest a way to divide industry profits among the firms. In these studies, however, the cooperative solution primarily serves as a benchmark to which the essential object of research, the noncooperative outcomes, can be compared. Not much seems to have been said in the dynamic advertising game literature about intertemporal sustainability of a cooperative agreement. This question is not trivial and is the focus of this paper.

To determine a cooperative outcome on which all can agree, firms negotiate before the start of the game. The intention is to act collectively by forming, and maintaining, the grand coalition. In the absence of a binding agreement (which often is illegal) on cooperation, there is no guarantee that firms will stick to the strategies prescribed by the agreement. Smaller coalitions — or single firms — may find it attractive to leave the grand coalition during the course of the game. Indeed, being rational, they will do so if they can obtain higher profits by leaving the grand coalition and acting in their own best interest. Deviations may occur at any time during the play of the game and makes the cooperative agreement potentially unstable.

To avoid that coalitions or single firms defect on the grand coalition outcome, the cooperative agreement must be time consistent. An agreement is, briefly speaking, time consistent if the grand coalition’s optimal profit is distributed in such a way that no subcoalition has an incentive to leave the grand coalition at any instant of time. This is accomplished if one can find a profit allocation (also known as an imputation) that belongs to the core. An imputation is in the core if coalitional rationality is satisfied, that is, no coalition can gain by leaving the grand coalition.

We should mention that our approach to establishing intertemporal cooperation, viz., by implementing a cooperative agreement which belongs to the core, is not the only way to sustain cooperation. For example, in a non-cooperative differential game of international pollution control (Dockner & Long, 1993) have shown that if players (governments) use nonlinear Markov-perfect strategies, and if the discount rate is sufficiently low, then a Pareto-optimal steady-state pollution stock can be supported as a subgame-perfect equilibrium. There are, however, many equilibria to chose among and preplay communication will be needed.

Note that Dockner and Long’s result assumes that governments play a non-cooperative game. Our setup is a cooperative game which establishes the sustainability of a desired outcome in a quite different way.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the differential game. Sections 3 and 4, respectively, identify an equilibrium in a noncooperative Nash game and an optimal solution of the grand coalition’s joint-maximization problem. Section 5 characterizes the core and Section 6 shows how one can distribute the grand coalition’s optimal profit such that the profit allocation belongs to the core. Section 7 concludes.

Consider an oligopolistic market with n firms, each selling its own particular brand (product or service). Our aim is to construct a model that is simple but still allows us to make our points.

We restrict our analysis to the case of a triopoly (
                        
                           n
                           =
                           3
                        
                     ) of symmetric firms 
                        3
                     
                     
                        3
                        Assuming identical firms is mainly a matter of mathematical convenience. In capital accumulation games, Reynolds (1987); 1991), for example, considered identical firms.
                     . The extension to an arbitrary number of firms (greater than three) would be straightforward in Sections 3 and 4 where we deal with a noncooperative game and a joint optimization problem, respectively. An extension enables one to see what are the implications if the number of firms in the industry decreases or increases. This comes, however, at a cost: In the coalitional games of Sections 5 and 6, the number of possible coalitions would increase and the notation be more complicated. Thus, readability would suffer.

Time t is continuous and the planning horizon of firms is infinite; 
                        
                           t
                           ∈
                           [
                           0
                           ,
                           ∞
                           )
                        
                     . Let ai
                     (t) ≥ 0 be the rate of advertising effort (e.g., seconds of television advertising, millimeters of newspaper or magazine advertisement) of firm i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Advertising efforts affect present and future sales and hence revenues. To represent the intertemporal effects of advertising one can define a nonnegative stock, henceforth denoted Gi
                     (t). This stock of ‘advertising goodwill’ is supposed to summarize past and present effects of advertising. In our model, goodwill stocks will act as state variables while advertising efforts are control variables that affect the evolution of goodwill stocks. State and control variables also affect the profits of firms.

Suppose that the stock of advertising goodwill of firm i evolves according to the differential equation

                     in which the constant κ > 0 reflects the efficiency of advertising effort of a firm. Due to symmetry, advertising efforts of all firms are equally efficient and without loss of generality we can set 
                        
                           κ
                           =

                     . Since advertising effort cannot be negative, the dynamics in (1) imply that goodwill cannot be decreased. The strategic implication of this is that once a firm has accumulated goodwill up to a certain level, it is locked in. The firm’s only options are to stay at this level (by not advertising) or advertise to further increase its stock of goodwill.

We shall make an assumption which (i) enables us to restrict our attention to strategies for which value functions are continuously differentiable and (ii) makes it unnecessary to explore the full state space of the system:

                        
                           A1.
                           The initial values of advertising goodwill stock satisfy g
                              0 < β/6.

The dynamics in (1) are a special case of the Nerlove and Arrow (1962) model

                           )
                        
                     . Goodwill depreciation can be seen as reflecting the argument that a dollar spent on advertising some time ago should contribute less than a dollar spent today. The depreciation parameter δ also has an interpretation as a measure of the carry-over effect of advertising: The smaller δ, the larger the carry-over effect.

The model in (1) can be interpreted as one in which an advertising dollar spent today has the same effect as a dollar spent earlier or advertising has maximal carry-over effect. In any case, the dynamics in (1) can be seen as an approximation to a market where goodwill decays rather slowly. It has been chosen, with a view to the rather complicated calculations needed in coalitional games in Sections 5 and 6, to employ the simpler dynamics in (1). We are quite confident that the results in Sections 5 to 6, which are the main contribution of the paper, will not change, qualitatively speaking, if depreciation were introduced.

Dynamics with no depreciation have occasionally been employed in literature on capital accumulation. If in this type of model one assumes that disinvestment is impossible, it follows that investment is irreversible. This is an interesting topic which has been studied in, e.g., Dockner, Jørgensen, Long, and Sorger (2000); Fudenberg and Tirole (1992); Long (2010).

                        Remark 1
                        The Nerlove–Arrow dynamics assume that the evolution of a firm’s advertising goodwill depends on its own effort only. This reflects a hypothesis that competitors’ advertising has no — or only negligible — impact on the goodwill level of a firm. Depending on, e.g., market characteristics and consumer behavior, the assumption may or may not apply. The obvious modification is to include competitors’ advertising efforts, aj
                           (t), j ≠ i, on the right-hand side of (1), affecting negatively the goodwill stock of firm i. This was done in, e.g., Nair and Narasimhan (2006); Viscolani and Zaccour (2009).

                     The derivative in the second line states that the sales function is concave in Gi
                     , given Gj
                      and Gk
                     . This implies that it is suboptimal to have Gi
                      → ∞. Negativity of the third derivative means that the sales rate of firm i decreases if the goodwill stock of firm k ≠ i increases. Thus, if brand k becomes more popular among consumers, sales of brand i decreases. Finally, the fourth derivative says that the marginal ‘productivity’ of Gi
                      decreases if Gk
                      increases. Thus, the two stocks are strategic substitutes (see, e.g., Fudenberg & Tirole, 1992).

Let π be the constant margin (i.e., profit per unit of sales) of firm i. The cost of advertising effort ai
                      of firm i is supposed to be quadratic, reflecting increasing marginal costs of advertising

The games considered in this paper are autonomous, i.e., all parameters are time-independent. Moreover, the planning horizon is infinite. In such problems, a standard approach in the literature is to look for stationary solutions/equilibria. This means that advertising strategies and value functions do not depend explicitly on time

                     The above solution is feasible in the following sense. If the profit margin π is zero, the value function should be zero because the firm has no revenue and does not advertise. It is readily seen that the solution passes this test (which can be found in Bass, Krishamoorthy, Prasad, & Sethi, 2005).

                     which shows that the goodwill stock of firm i converges to β/4 for t → ∞. Thus, the overall goodwill stock converges to 3β/4.

The conclusion is that, in the long run, competition leads to “over-accumulation” of goodwill, and hence over-spending on advertising. This result was expected and has been noted in related models of accumulation.

In this game, firms negotiate before the start of the game with the purpose of forming the grand coalition. Negotiations concern the choice of the firms’ individual strategies as well as a rule that determines how the joint profit earned by the grand coalition will be shared among the firms. If they cannot agree, we assume that the noncooperative game in Section 3 is played, without any possibility of renegotiation. If in the course of the game a coalition deviates from the agreement made at the start of the game, we assume (following Kranich, Perea, & Peters, 2005) that there is no option of renegotiation and some noncooperative game is played after the defection has happened. For this game we adopt a classical assumption (Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944) and suppose that it is a zero-sum game, played by a defecting coalition and the left-out firm(s).

                        Remark 3
                        Other assumptions exist for the choice of the type of game that is played upon a defection. For instance, the defector(s) and the left-out firm(s) play a nonzero-sum game such that the coalition (as a single player) plays its best response to the best responses of the left-out firm(s). An alternative assumption is that left-out firms fall back to their noncooperative equilibrium strategies (Petrosjan and Zaccour, 2003). The idea here is that if the grand coalition is not formed, left-out firms do not care whether or not a smaller coalition is formed.

Adopting the zero-sum assumption implies that the value of a coalition is well-defined, being the maximin value in the game between a coalition and its anti-coalition. Thus, the value of a coalition is what it can obtain after a defection, whatever the anti-coalition might do. If the game is not zero-sum, the value of a coalition may not be uniquely defined.

In the grand coalition, firms act collectively as one decision maker. The objective function of the coalition is the sum of the individual profits given by (7), that is,

                      depends on the total stock of goodwill. The intuition of optimal strategies is that as long as the total goodwill stock at time t is “low” (Y(t) < β/2), the coalition should advertise. Below we prove that Y(t) < β/2 for all t.

The goodwill stock Y(t) evolves according to the differential equation

To make the notation more transparent we denote from now the initial time by t
                     0 (with the understanding that t
                     0 is zero). If the firms agree to form the grand coalition, they determine the optimal advertising strategies, the optimal profit of the coalition, and the optimal state trajectory. The latter is given by (21) and henceforth denoted GC
                     ( · )

                     . If no agreement can be reached, firms play the noncooperative game.

Suppose that time is t and the grand coalition has existed from time t
                     0 to t. The current state then is GC
                     (t) and the following possibilities exist:

                        
                           •
                           All members of the coalition continue to employ their cooperative strategies from time t. This happens if no coalition (including singletons) has an incentive to deviate at time t from the agreement.

A coalition decides to deviate at time t. Deviation means that the coalition chooses a strategy which differs from the one prescribed for the coalition as member(s) of the grand coalition. Coalition members act as one decision maker. It is clear that a coalition deviates only if its profit stands to increase, compared to what coalition members would be paid as members of the grand coalition.

Any coalition is free to deviate. We shall assume that after a defection, cooperation cannot be restored (cf. Kranich et al., 2005)

                        Allowing for renegotiations would radically change the model and give rise to a new game to be studied.
                     . Following a defection, those firms that did not defect form an anti-coalition. This coalition plays a noncooperative game with the deviating coalition. In this two-player game we adopt, as already said, the classical assumption that it is a zero-sumgame (see, e.g., Owen, 1995). The payoff of a deviating coalition that we denote S, is the sum of the individual payoffs of the firms belonging to S. The payoff of the anti-coalition N\S is the negative of the payoff of S.

In a cooperative dynamic game setting, the issue of time consistency of a cooperative agreement is essential. Time consistency means that the cooperative agreement made at time zero is not compromised at any instant of time during the course of the game as the state evolves along the trajectory GC
                     (·). Thus, at any point on GC
                     (·), no coalition wishes to deviate from what is prescribed for the members of the grand coalition. To ensure time consistency, the grand coalition must distribute its profits in a way such that no coalition has an incentive to deviate at any t.

                     The value (or characteristic) functions on the left-hand sides in (26) represent what the deviating coalition can guarantee itself when they foresee the retaliation from their opponents in the anti-coalition.

The calculations of the value functions in the two types of games are straightforward but tedious and have been put into the appendix. The appendix also contains some observations and intuitions pertaining to equilibrium strategies

In both types of games, A and B, respectively, four cases need to be considered:

                                    Positive advertising rate
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  

Calculations in the appendix show that Cases 1.1 and 2.1 violate necessary optimality conditions and therefore are discarded. We are left with Cases 1.2 and 2.2. It turns out that in both types of games, A and B, left-out firm(s) always advertise at the maximal rate
                        9
                     
                     
                        9
                        Because the right-hand side of the HJB equations are linear in the advertising rate of the left-out players, we need to impose an upper bound on advertising, say, 
                              
                                 
                                    a
                                    ¯
                                 
                                 .
                              
                           
                        
                     . This result is driven by the zero-sum game assumption which implies that it is in the best interest of left-out firm(s) to advertise so as to increase their goodwill stock(s) at a maximal rate. The deviating firm(s) may or may not advertise; this will depend on the value of the shadow price(s) of their goodwill stock(s).

To guarantee that the cooperative agreement is time consistent, an imputation ξi
                     (GC
                     (t)) must belong to the core in any subgame Γ(GC
                     (t), t), emanating from state GC
                     (t) at time t. This amounts to validating the inequalities

                     is the profit functional of firm i in a game starting out at time t. Since payoffs Pi
                      are equal, the inequality in (30) can be rewritten as max (Pi
                     ) ≥ max min (Pi
                     ) which is true by definition. We conclude that the imputation in (28) belongs to the core.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The aim of the current research is to study the sustainability of intertemporal cooperation among oligopolistic firms in a particular market for a product or service. For this purpose we suggested a differential games model of advertising competition. The model is deliberately simple: there are three firms only and they are symmetric. The situation that we consider is one where individual firms wish to coordinate their advertising efforts to achieve a common objective, the maximization of their overall profits. Thus, firms try to form and maintain a cartel, the grand coalition.

To obtain an agreement to form the grand coalition, any firm must be guaranteed a share of the coalition’s overall profits which exceeds what the firm could earn by acting in its own best interest. To sustain an agreement,more is needed: members of the grand coalition must be compensated in such a way that at no instant of time during the play of the game, no single firm or coalition must have an incentive to defect on the agreement. We have shown that there exists an imputation (profit allocation), and indeed a simple one, which belongs to the core in any subgame played along the cooperative state trajectory. This property guarantees that defections are not profitable.

The paper characterized analytically the optimal advertising strategies of the firms in the grand coalition and determined the corresponding state trajectories.

Future work in the area could be concerned with the generalization to an arbitrary number of firms, primarily to see how the number of firms in the market may affect the sustainability of a cooperative agreement. Another option would be to assume that firms are asymmetric, to see how differences in advertising costs and efficiency as well as profit margins would influence sustainability. However, an asymmetric game would probably be analytically intractable.

This appendix provides the calculations leading to advertising strategies and value functions in games of Types A and B. It also gives some intuitions for the choice of equilibrium advertising strategies.

                         is an upper bound on an advertising effort rate 
                           10

                           An upper bound on advertising effort typically reflects that firms have limited advertising budgets. The upper bound is needed since the advertising rate of the minimizing player appears linearly in the maximand.
                        . The intuition of the equilibrium advertising rates in (32) and (33) is the following. If shadow prices ∂V
                        
                           S∣k
                        (G)/∂Gh
                         are positive, it pays for coalition S to increase its goodwill stocks Gh
                        . Hence both members of the coalition should advertise. If the shadow price ∂V
                        
                           S∣k
                        (G)/∂Gk
                         is positive, a marginal increase of the left-out firm’s goodwill stock Gk
                        , when this firm use positive advertising at the rate 
                           
                              
                                 a
                                 k
                              
                              =
                              
                                 a
                                 ¯
                              
                              ,
                           
                         would increase the profits of coalition S. This is not in the best interest of firm k and hence it should choose not to advertise. On the other hand, if ∂V
                        
                           S∣k
                        (G)/∂Gk
                         is negative, a marginal increase in Gk
                         would decrease the profits of coalition S. This is desirable for firm k and it should advertise at the maximum rate.

                           As for Type A games, we conclude that Cases 1.2 and 2.2 are the only feasible ones. Left-out firms always advertise at the maximal rate. In Case 1.2 the deviating firm does not advertise; in Case 2.2 it does.
