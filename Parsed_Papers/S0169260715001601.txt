                  Taiwan is an area where chronic hepatitis is endemic. Liver cancer is so common that it has been ranked first among cancer mortality rates since the early 1980s in Taiwan. Besides, liver cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases are the sixth or seventh in the causes of death. Therefore, as shown by the active research on hepatitis, it is not only a health threat, but also a huge medical cost for the government. The estimated total number of hepatitis B carriers in the general population aged more than 20 years old is 3,067,307. Thus, a case record review was conducted from all patients with diagnosis of acute hepatitis admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of a well-known teaching-oriented hospital in Taipei. The cost of medical resource utilization is defined as the total medical fee. In this study, a fuzzy neural network is employed to develop the cost forecasting model. A total of 110 patients met the inclusion criteria. The computational results indicate that the FNN model can provide more accurate forecasts than the support vector regression (SVR) or artificial neural network (ANN). In addition, unlike SVR and ANN, FNN can also provide fuzzy IF–THEN rules for interpretation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Hepatitis is a medical condition defined by the inflammation of the liver and characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in the tissue of the organ. It may occur with limited or no symptoms, but often leads to jaundice, poor appetite and malaise. Acute hepatitis lasts less than six months and is labeled as chronic when it persists longer. Usually, a patient who has hepatitis should have several treatments in hospital before recovering. During the treatment period, the hospital needs to prepare medicines and medical applications. However, as every patient's condition is totally different, this makes it difficult for the hospital to prepare the necessary medical resources. Thus, if medical costs could be predicted in advance, then the hospital could prepare for the related medical resources efficiently in order to provide high-quality treatment and avoid the unnecessary waste of resources. Therefore, in order to avoid waste and be more efficient, developing a cost-predicting system to estimate medical cost for patients has become a very critical issue in hospitals.

Data mining can extract hidden association rules from large databases to acquire useful knowledge. With the advances in data mining techniques in recent years, scholars have started to apply them to metabolic syndrome research. Huang [1] used an efficient data mining algorithm, called DCIP (the data cutting and inner product method), to explore association rules between the lifestyles of factory workers in Taiwan and the metabolic syndrome. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a system from neurophysiology models. In general, an ANN consists of a collection of simple, nonlinear computing elements whose inputs and outputs are connected together to form a network [2], and it is applied in the medical field [3–5]. Vapnik [6] promoted the SVM method in 1999 to obtain function fitting problems, forming the support vector regression (SVR) method. Currently, the SVR model is widely used in many fields to develop predicting models with good performance [7–10].

The popular research topic of fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) has been successfully applied in many areas, such as in control, identification, prediction, pattern recognition, and bioengineering. FNNs inherit their learning ability from neural networks and their inference technology from fuzzy systems; they are used for solving the aforementioned characteristic behaviors [11–22]. The fuzzy neural networks combine the low-level learning and computational power of neural networks into fuzzy systems and the high-level, human-like thinking and reasoning of fuzzy systems into neural networks.

Acute hepatitis lasts less than 6 months while chronic hepatitis lasts longer than 6 months. Acute hepatitis has several possible causes, such as infectious viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C, D and E), other viral diseases (glandular fever and cytomegalovirus), severe bacterial infections, amoebic infections, medicines (acetaminophen and halothane) and toxins (alcohol and fungal toxins). The severity of illness in acute hepatitis ranges from asymptomatic to fulminant and fatal. Some patients are asymptomatic with abnormalities noted only in laboratory studies, while other patients might have symptoms and signs, such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, jaundice, fever, splenomegaly, or ascites.

Chronic hepatitis also has several different causes, like infectious viral hepatitis (hepatitis B, C and D), drug reactions, alcohol, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and hemochromatosis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), of the 2 billion people infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), more than 350 million have chronic (lifelong) infections [23]. Hepatitis B results in 600,000 deaths each year from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [24]. Taiwan is a hyperendemic area of hepatitis B virus (HBV). The estimated total number of HBsAg carriers in the general population >20 years old is 3,067,307; 61% of the patients involved in this study are hepatitis B-related [25].

The typical presentation of severe acute exacerbation is a short onset of jaundice and very high ALT level, sometimes preceded by prodromal constitutional symptoms, in patients with chronic hepatitis B. It is often misdiagnosed as acute hepatitis, especially in those with a negative history of hepatitis in the past or who had never been examined for hepatitis marker in the past [26]. The symptoms of severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B can be very similar to those of acute hepatitis B. Hence, severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B might be misdiagnosed as acute hepatitis B in some cases [27].

In countries with intermediate or high endemicity for HBV, exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B may be the first presentation of HBV infection [28]. Although these exacerbations are usually transient and asymptomatic, 1%–2.4% of patients later develop hepatic decompensation [29–31]. In this study, we believe that the great majority of patients with acute hepatitis B suffer from acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B.

Child–Pugh classification has been used for decades to measure the severity of chronic liver disease. Recent studies have shown that the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) more accurately predicts the short and mid-term survival of patients with cirrhosis compared to the CTP system. MELD, which has 3 parameters (serum bilirubin, creatinine, and prothrombin time) that need logarithmic transformation, has the advantage of a wide-range continuous scale; it is more objective and less variable [32]. Reports of predictors for acute hepatitis include: MELD Scoring System, Discriminant Function (DF) and Multivariate analysis. However, there are limited reports using abdominal echogram and Child–Pugh classification as a predictor for acute hepatitis.

Sheth et al. [33] used MELD score and the Discriminant Function (DF) as a predictor of mortality in 34 patients hospitalized with alcoholic hepatitis. The MELD score performs as well as the DF in predicting mortality at 30 days. A MELD score greater than 11, or the presence of both ascites and an elevated bilirubin greater than 8mg/dL should prompt consideration of specific therapeutic interventions to reduce mortality.

Li et al. [34] tried to find the prognostic factors for chronic severe hepatitis and constructed a prognostic model. The clinical and laboratory indices of 213 patients with chronic severe hepatitis within 24h after diagnosis were analyzed retrospectively. Death or survival was limited to within 3 months after diagnosis. The mortality of all patients was 47.42%. Compared with the survival group, age, basis of hepatocirrhosis, infection, degree of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and levels of total bilirubin (TBil), total cholesterol (CHO), cholinesterase (CHE), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood creatinine (Cr), blood sodium ions (Na), peripheral blood leukocytes (WBC), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), international normalized ratio (INR) of blood coagulation and prothrombin time (PT) were significantly different in the group who died. The significant attributes are shown in Table 1
                        . They concluded that multivariate analysis in the prognosis of chronic severe hepatitis and the regression model was of significant value in the prognosis of this disease.

Basically, the prognosis of liver cirrhosis is assessed by using the Child–Pugh score. Since abdominal ultrasound is also a commonly used tool for the evaluation and rapid diagnosis of acute hepatitis in the ED [35], the objective of this study is to determine whether the Child–Pugh score and abdominal ultrasound could be used simultaneously to predict the medical resource cost in patients of acute hepatitis without liver cirrhosis in the ED. In 2008, the consensus recommendations of the Asian Pacific Association for the study of the liver (APASL) indicated several prognostic scores of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) [36]. Liver-specific scoring systems (Mayo Risk Score, Combined Clinical and Laboratory Index) are adequate, but the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and III were proved to be more powerful because they include additional physiologic parameters, and therefore also take into account additional complications associated with this liver disorder [37,38]. An accurate prognosis of the patient helps in the appropriate selection of a treatment program.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The material and methodology are presented in Section 2. Section 3 shows the computational results. Finally, the concluding remarks are made in Section 4.

In this section, the material, including the acute hepatitis data set with description statistic and the fuzzy neural network system are introduced.

The data which are used for medical resource cost forecasting of patients with acute hepatitis admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) in this study were collected from a well-known teaching-oriented hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. Table 2
                         shows the descriptive statistics about the dataset. Acute hepatitis lasts less than 6 months while chronic hepatitis lasts longer than 6 months. Acute hepatitis has several possible causes, such as infectious viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C, D and E), other viral diseases (glandular fever and cytomegalovirus), severe bacterial infections, amoebic infections, medicines (acetaminophen and halothane) and toxins (alcohol and fungal toxins). The severity of illness in acute hepatitis ranges from asymptomatic to fulminant and fatal. Some patients are asymptomatic with abnormalities noted only by laboratory studies, while other patients might have symptoms and signs, such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, jaundice, fever, splenomegaly, or ascites [34,36–38].

The advantage of FNN is that the fuzzy inference rules can be explained because they are given in the form of fuzzy IF–THEN rules. This allows the causal relationship to be more easily understood by users or doctors. The fuzzy IF–THEN rule is employed in FNN. The kth rule, which is instantiated as:

Layer 2: the layer comprises input values membership functions.

Many studies indicate that the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) have good performance to construct the forecasting model [3–5,7–10]. Besides FNN, this study also uses the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) to construct the forecasting models for comparison. The LIBSVM package developed by Chang and Lin [41] is used to construct the SVR model. The ANN, which is a feedforward neural network with back-propagation learning algorithm, is coded in C++ programming language. The forecasting performance is evaluated using the performance measures, the mean square error (MSE) and the mean absolute difference (MAD). The definitions of the measures are shown as Eqs. (9) and (10):

@&#RESULTS@&#

According to [34], there are different variables which can be used to predict medical cost. In [35], the study indicated that the Child–Pugh score and abdominal ultrasound finding can be used to predict the medical resources required for patients with acute hepatitis. The results of correlation analysis between medical cost and variables are shown in Table 3
                        . These six variables have significant correlation to the medical cost. Therefore, in this study, six input variables: hepatic portal vein varicose (PV), Gallbladder wall thickening (GB wall), splenomegaly, Child–Pugh index (CP), total bilirubin (T-bil) and prothrombin (PT) are used for training the FNN model. The medical cost is the output of the forecasting model. The notations for all of the variables are shown in Table 4
                        , and the descriptive statistics of the medical cost is shown in Table 5
                        .

In FNN, the learning rate, η, significantly affects the learning efficiency. However, as there are four parameters in the FNN, a full factorial analysis would be very time consuming, as a very large number of cases must be studied if more than three parameters are used. In order to reduce the required number of simulations, the Taguchi method, which uses orthogonal parametric arrays, is used [42]. The orthogonal arrays only identify the main effects and not the interactions between the parameters. This allows for the efficient screening of a large number of parameters and identifies the parameters that have a greater impact on the performance.

Four factors with three levels are used to design the parameters for the FNN. The notations of the factors are as follows: the learning rate of mean (η
                        
                           m
                        ), the learning rate of standard deviation (η
                        
                           s
                        ), the learning rate of weight (η
                        
                           w
                        ), and the momentum (α). In the beginning of the experiment, the initial setting of the parameters with three levels is as follows:

                        . This experiment determines the lowest MSE, so the-lower-the-better criterion is used for the calculation. The software package, MINITAB, is used to perform the Taguchi experiment, and the combinations of the parameters are shown in Fig. 2
                        . This study sets the MSE as the objective. The smaller MSE is better; thus, this experiment features the-lower-the-best characteristics. The S/N ratio is the signal to noise ratio, which is used to evaluate the quality and stability of the Taguchi experimental design. In the Taguchi experiment, the mean value and the S/N ratio are consistent. A lower mean value indicates a higher S/N ratio, and a lower mean indicates a generated product of better quality. According to the result, the combinations of the parameters in FNN are shown in Table 6
                        . In ANN, three parameters: the learning rate (η), the number of node in hidden layer (H
                        
                           n
                        ) and the momentum (α) are determined in Taguchi experiment. The results are shown in Table 7
                        .

For the experiments, K-fold cross-validation is employed to confirm the robustness of the developed models. The data set is divided into K subsets and repeated K times. Each time, one of the K subsets is used as the test set and the other K
                        −1 subsets are put together to form a training set. Then the average error (e.g. MSE) across all k trials is computed. This study sets K as 10. Thus, 90% of the data was used to train samples; the subsequent 10% was used to test the sample, and the experiments were repeated ten times. The results of the three methods: FNN, SVR and ANN, are shown in Table 8
                        , Fig. 3 and Fig. 4
                        
                        . For the SVR, the average training MSE and the average test MSE are 0.0091 and 0.0113, respectively. For the FNN, the average training MSE and the average test MSE are 0.0085 and 0.0103, respectively. Therefore, in terms of the MSE criterion, the FNN can provide a better forecast. For the MAD criterion, the results are the same. For the ANN, the average training MAD and the average test MAD are 0.0773 and 0.0882, respectively. The training MAD is better than FNN (training MAD is 0.0784). The converge curve of ANN and FNN are shown in Fig. 5
                        . The ANN can converge in 100 iterations, but the FNN converges in around 200 iterations. Basically, training the FNN model is more time consuming but can obtain a better estimation. The membership functions (e.g. the Gaussian function) after training the FNN model, are shown in Fig. 6
                        , and some of the fuzzy rules (Table 9
                        ) are illustrated as follows:

Rule 1 reveals when PV is low, GB wall is low, Splenomegaly is high, CP is medium, T-bil is high and PT is high; the estimated medical cost is around NT$21,363 according to the FNN model result. Thus, the hospital manager can evaluate the medical cost needed for the patient from the rules and arrange the necessary medical resources.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this study, an FNN is employed to develop a medical cost estimation model for acute hepatitis patients. Six input variables: PV, GB wall, splenomegaly, CP, T-bil and PT are used for training the FNN model. The computational results indicated that FNN has the lowest MSE and MAD values: 0.0103 and 0.0818, respectively, compared to those of the ANN and SVR models in testing. In addition, after training, FNN can form the fuzzy IF–THEN rules in order to predict the medical cost. These rules can be used by medical doctors or hospital managers to explain the cost structure. Basically, medical resource waste can be reduced and operation efficiency enhanced. Future studies might collect more data in order to improve the forecasting accuracy. Besides, other learning algorithms can also be used to develop the forecasting model.
