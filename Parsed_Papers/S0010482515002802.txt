@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Evolutionary game theory (EGT) proposed by John Maynard Smith and George Price [1] initiated new viewpoints in numerous areas of biology like genetics, ecology, and etiology. Since game theory is linked to Darwinian fitness and species evolution, it is a useful and efficient methodology for analysis and simulation of the dynamics of changes within different biological subpopulations in a biological population, where individuals with different phenotypes (strategies, approaches) compete or cooperate with others according to their evolutionary traits without any rationality following their instincts and encoded behaviour, and decision-making is a key factor. The result is a change of the degree of evolutionary adjustment by achieving better access to food supplies, females, or life space. This change is termed a payoff and the evolutionary adjustment is termed fitness. Due to different adjustments to the environment and interactions between individuals, the phenotypic consistency of a population may tend to stabilize its structure and achieve a stable monomorphic or polymorphic equilibrium. The stable (in the sense of its phenotypic content) population is called the Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) or Evolutionary Stable State [2]. The former is a phenotype that has been adapted by the majority of the population and cannot be repressed by other phenotypes. However, the opposite situation is possible; ESS may coexist stably with other phenotypes or even suppress them and dominate in the population. The latter is the situation when more than one phenotype exists in the final, stable population, that is resistant to the inflow of mutants or to environmental changes.

In this paper we expand theoretical evolutionary game models (both mean-field and spatial) by including parallel changes of the phenotypes’ adjustment during transient generations within the population. These changes are performed by varying the parameters in the payoff matrix, which determine fitness (payoff, adjustment) resulting from different interactions between players, taking into account both the benefits and the costs of particular actions and strategies. Alteration of these parameters changes them into functions that simulate (within this model) changes in the environment and define their different impacts on the fitness. Simulation of environment changes could be considered, for instance, as a relevant resource such as water, food or space which is accessible for the individuals inhabiting this particular environment. In spatial games, these functions are represented by an additional lattice where another and parallel game based on cellular automata is performed. We introduce a new category of spatial games termed mixed spatial evolutionary games (MSEG) that allow introduction of the heterogeneity not only of the population, but also of the particular individuals that may use different strategies, i.e., have different and mixed phenotypes in the evolutionary sense. Here we apply these ideas to the hawk and dove model, but more complex simulations for other models, for instance tumour evolution, should be feasible.

EGT allows to foresee if a population tends to be heterogeneous or rather if one phenotype survives and dominates. To follow the dynamics of phenotypes replicator equations may be used [3] which describe the behaviour of the population in time during successive generations starting from the initial frequency of occurrence until the equilibrium defined by the Evolutionary Stable State is reached (however, it may happen that there are not any stable states). Due to the main assumption about perfect mixing of the phenotypes in the population, the results are in some way global and averaged and consequently the impact of local spatial arrangement and internal interactions in the neighbourhood cannot be analysed. This simplification has been overcome by spatial evolutionary game theory (SEGT) [4].

To properly introduce SEGT it is necessary to return to mean-field (not spatial) EGT and one of its applications. In 1997 Tomlinson and Bodmer [5] proposed the use of game theory methods in modelling interactions and communication between tumour cells. Their work initiated a series of other papers studying different kinds of phenotypes and tumour populations (see [6,7] for surveys) in one of which Bach and co-workers [4] proposed an algorithm for spatial analysis of the phenomena of carcinogenesis using SEGT, which appears to be an appropriate and useful approach to take into account another factor, allocation of space and players. Consequently, spatial games have become very popular recently although their origins are in cellular automata [8] combined with classical game theory.

The main assumption of the spatial games presented in [4] is that each cell on the lattice is represented by a player following only one strategy. The local payoff for each player is the sum of payoffs due to interactions with cells in the neighbourhood according to the payoff matrix. We refer to this approach here as the standard, classical one or SEGT. Alternatively, cells on the spatial lattice can also be considered as heterogeneous instead of homogeneous, so that each particular player may contain mixed phenotypes. Spatial games of the type which we proposed in [9] to model interaction of cells in the, so called, bystander effect are termed mixed spatial evolutionary games (MSEG). In MSEG it is important to mention the definition of the phenotype, which is the set of traits or characteristics of an organism [10] and hence different degrees of playing a particular strategy are treated as different characteristics that define different phenotypes. It may happen that within the population, all of the players have diverse phenotypes, which is probably an more appropriate description for biological phenomena. For the sake of simplicity and following the manner of reasoning in SEGT, these strategies and traits still correspond to phenotypes and a general, collective point of view is defined as a player’s phenotypic composition. In fact, the game is performed on a multidimensional lattice (dependent on the number of defined phenotypes in the model), where each layer represents a particular phenotype (as the frequency of occurrence) of the player. For the computation of the local adaptation, the sum of the payoffs between each phenotype (within two players) multiplied by their rate of occurrence is calculated first, followed by summing these values for each player in the neighbourhood.

When performing a spatial game, in every single iteration one global algorithm is used on the lattice, forming a torus. The algorithm is basically the same for both spatial approaches, and contains:
                        
                           −
                           payoff updating—the local fitness of each player is calculated taking into account the local neighbourhood.

cell mortality—10% of the players are removed from the lattice at every generation.

reproduction—chosen players interact with their neighbours.

The payoff updating step has been already described while introducing SEGT and MSEG, and a more detailed view will be provided below in a concrete model. The next stage takes into account cell mortality, a term used in the original algorithm [4] which has a slightly different meaning in MSEG; players are not removed from the lattice, but interact with their neighbours which may result in changes of the player’s phenotypic composition. In this paper semi-synchronous updating is used, and 10% of the players from the lattice are chosen to play this role. Alternatively, synchronous updating (all cells are removed/chosen within one iteration) or asynchronous updating (only one cell is removed/chosen within one iteration) may be applied, but these kinds of mortality are not considered in this paper, because their interpretation in biological systems is not always clear. The authors of SEGT proposed two kinds of reproduction:
                        
                           −
                           deterministic—the winner is the strongest player.

probabilistic—the player’s local adaptation is further divided by the sum of the local payoffs in the neighbourhood.

Classical SEGT has been extended by two other reproductions (switching and quantitative) and studied in [11]. However, for the purposes of MSEG we focus on only deterministic and probabilistic reproductions, because they are simple to apply in games of this type.

A different approach for the player interpretation (polyphenotypic description) allows creation and use of other reproductions:
                        
                           −
                           weighted mean of the strongest players—in accordance with the players’ payoffs, the weighted mean from phenotypes is computed for the players with the highest scores.

weighted mean of the best interval—players are divided into intervals in accordance with their payoffs. The weighted mean is computed only for the players from the best interval.

Another difference between SEGT and MSEG is that in the former a tie (when payoffs are equal) is settled randomly, while in the latter the average between phenotypic compositions is computed. Spatial games are complex due to the vast amount of different methods and parameters. An additional possibility to achieve different results is to consider diverse neighbourhood sizes and types (for instance von Neumann or Moore type).

The extension of spatial games which we describe here is a development of our previous studies [9,11], which were based on the work of Bach and co-workers [4] and on the ideas presented in [12] where hawk–dove games were revisited taking into account spatial aspects. In another spatial approach with the use of mixed strategies [13] the Prisoner’s Dilemma game is played on a spatial lattice with synchronous and asynchronous players’ choice and with a deterministic reproduction termed by the authors “imitation max”. But the use of the mixed-strategies is completely different than mixed-phenotype used by us. The mixed strategy in [13] describes the probability of pure strategy’s choice and when chosen (step called action updating) is used for the payoff computation. In our approach it describes the phenotypical composition of the player (individual) not followed by the choice of the strategy but used for the payoff computation. Yet another approach to multiple layers in evolutionary games can be found in [14], where the Prisoner’s Dilemma problem is studied in this context as a game performed on a network of interactions.

The application of evolutionary games to simulate processes involved in tumour development was a starting point for this class of spatial evolutionary games. This approach, however, could also be used for the one of the first evolutionary models. Maynard–Smith [15] proposed a model with two kinds of behaviour, fight or avoid, within a population of one species which is a symbolic representation of the ritual conflicts of two different strategies that have arisen in the process of evolution. Within a population consisting of such individuals, conflicts may be performed for resources, territory, food, or females.
                        
                           ─
                           Phenotypes:
                                 
                                    −
                                    Hawk – fighting strategy – escalates and continues until receiving an injury or the opponent escapes

Dove – avoiding strategy – retreats or shares with another dove

Parameters:
                                 
                                    −
                                    
                                       v—the benefit that may be obtained during the contest


                                       c—the cost of escalation

The payoff matrix (
                     Table 1) should be read vertically. The maximum feasible profit is 2v and can be gained by a hawk while interacting with a dove, and therefore the dove’s payoff is 0. When the same strategies interact between each other, it is necessary to share the maximum feasible profit and hawks additionally bear the cost of escalation.

The conditions for stable polymorphism (coexistence between all phenotypes) can be determined by the Bishop–Canning theory [16] which states that the phenotype’s mean payoff in the population shall be equal:

                              (3)

                                 and
                                 
                                 D

                                    v
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

Hence to achieve a stable polymorphic result v must be less than c (
                        Fig. 1a), or otherwise the population is dominated by hawks (Fig. 1b).

Our results for this model are independent of the initial frequencies of occurrence (Fig. 1, red asterisks). We will use the mean-field results for a comparison with those of spatial games.

Having introduced the model, we are led to details with examples for a better understanding of the spatial algorithms and methods.

The model contains two phenotypes and therefore two layers (two lattices) are used to define the player’s phenotypic composition (
                        Fig. 2). The sum of particular frequencies of occurrence equals 1, exactly as for the mean-field model. For example, for two individuals: A (hawk: 60%, dove: 40%) and B (hawk: 30%, dove: 70%) the local payoff for the interaction between A and B is:

Since each player may exhibit a mixed phenotype, the graphical representation on the spatial lattice should take this into account. In 
                        Fig. 3, starting with pure green for players that are 100% doves the colour is changed linearly into pure blue that represents 100% of hawks.

The payoff matrix does not have to remain constant during the game; the parameters may change depending on other factors (e.g. changes in the environment or any other external influence).

The model of hawks and doves may be extended by yet another parameter r (
                        Fig. 4) that represents the amount and the availability of resources like territory, food, etc. Following the reasoning discussed by Maynard–Smith [15] the parameter r will be treated rather like territory, but without division or additional effects of being an invader or owner.

For such games we can define some general, basic rules:
                           
                              −
                              Hawks, being more aggressive, tend to be better adjusted when r is relatively small.

Doves do better (or at least not worse than in a classical game) when resources are greater, providing opportunities for instance to “steal” food or to find it without interaction with another individual in the vast area.

Even if r is relatively large, hawks still bear the cost of escalation and doves still share the benefits. The exact value of r, however, may affect the intensity of escalation or distribution of resources.

We consider two different models that extend the basic model. The payoffs for particular interactions are now functions dependent on r, which are linear and are presented in the form of payoff values for r equals 0 and 1 (
                        Table 2). Red font indicates the changes in comparison with the original model (Table 1).

The assumption of this model is that for r=0 the payoff matrix is the same as that in the basic model. With increasing r, more chances and better adjustment are gained by doves (note the red numbers in Table 2). Therefore doves do not have to share the benefits, and in the case of interaction with hawks it is possible to gain some profits.

The next alteration (
                        Table 3) concerns the interaction between hawks, which in the case of r=0 they bear a double cost of escalation (due to limited resources), but when r=1 the cost is divided by two (red values in Table 3).

Spatial games give the opportunity to change r for a group of cells or even for each cell separately, whereas for mean-field games r is changed simultaneously for the entire population and does not depend on its current composition. For the spatial application we choose MSEG games, since they provide more possibilities to define different rules for the resources simulation. Here another lattice is needed, where a different game with different rules is performed. The rules are:
                           
                              1)
                              Individuals who are more hawks take from those who are less aggressive an amount of resources that results from the difference between the hawk’s frequency of occurrence.

A dove divides its resources with those doves that have more resources according to the dove’s frequency of occurrence.

The resources are limited to the (0, 1) interval.

An example describes this idea in a clearer way. The players are:

Player A: the first rule requires that 50% of player B’s resources shall be added to player A. Thus in the next iteration r for player A is equal to 0.95 and for player B to 0.25. The second rule does not have an application here. If the difference between hawks is larger and for instance 0.4 of the resources should be transferred from player B to player A, then this value shall be limited to 0.3 (hence, player B loses only 0.3).

Player B: the first rule does not have an application here, since it is dependent on the frequency of occurrence of hawks. Due to the fact that player A has got more resources, rule 2 can be applied. The difference between resources shall be multiplied by 70%, which gives 0.14 to be added to player B (r=0.39) and subtracted from player A (r=0.81).

@&#RESULTS@&#

To simplify the analysis and focus on different values of parameters only, all lattices (both for phenotypes and resources) were generated randomly.

We start with standard MSEG where the effect of resources is not taken into account.


                        
                        Fig. 5 shows the initial lattice and the mean-field counterpart for v=3 and c=9 where doves coexist with hawks in the population. 
                        Fig. 6 presents how the frequencies of occurrence for the entire population change through the following generations and shows only deterministic reproduction gives similar results to those of the mean-field game. Weighted mean reproductions promote doves (which almost dominate in the population) while probabilistic reproductions give chances to hawks. 
                        Fig. 7 demonstrates the final shape and structure of the population. For good visualisation both lattices (for doves and for hawks) need to be mixed. Hawks are represented in blue and doves in green, and therefore the results are a mixture of those two colours.

Another scenario is when v=12 and c=6 is illustrated in 
                        
                        Figs. 8 and 9. The results from a mean-field game show total domination of hawks. For a spatial game the results for probabilistic and deterministic reproductions are very similar; doves play a little better in the weighted mean reproductions, coexisting together with hawks in the population, but still to a low degree. The final structure of the population for all reproductions appears to be without any interesting clusters of the cells. All the results contain a different phenotypic composition, but they are spread evenly among the lattice.

We start with the mean-field model where parameter r is changed linearly from 1 to 0, with the aim of showing the possible results without focussing on the r profile during the following generations.

The set of parameters used for 
                        Fig. 10 shows a population where the doves initially dominate, but then when resources decreases there is an impact on the number of doves. We can see also some kind of dynamic delay—the frequency of doves still rises a little after the resources have declined. When the benefits are higher than costs (v=12, c=6), the dynamics of changes depend on the initial frequencies of occurrence at r=1. Moreover, the frequencies are constant for that period (
                        Fig. 11). Still the final population contains only hawks.

The first model with an additional dimension (Table 2) will lead to increased adjustment for doves, especially for high values of resources. Therefore for v=3, c=9 and r=1 doves totally dominate in the population for the mean-field model if r does not change.

The changes of particular phenotypes in the entire population for the model with resources (
                        Fig. 12) show differences in both probabilistic and deterministic reproductions; the dynamics of changes in the probabilistic reproduction oscillate more than in the basic MSEG and hawks are somewhat better adjusted. Major differences are seen with the deterministic reproduction (which gives a similar result as the probabilistic one) where doves no longer dominate in the population. Surprisingly, hawks have better adjustment than in the basic MSEG model. Due to the fact that starting from r=0 the payoff matrix is the basic one and when r=1 then doves shall dominate, the expected result is that doves shall be the dominant phenotype in the population.

For the set of parameters v=12 and c=6 (
                        Fig. 13) only probabilistic reproduction gives similar results to those for MSEG without resources. Other reproductions show some discrepancies in contrast to unenhanced MSEG, mainly that the frequency of occurrence of hawks is reduced which is why in the weighted mean reproduction for best cells doves are the dominant phenotype. Moreover, interesting clusters of different cells are feasible (
                        Fig. 14).

This model (Table 3) describes the population where the payoff due to interaction between hawks has been altered. When r=0 hawks should bear greater costs of escalation, and when r is 1 the costs are lower. The simulations were performed for the same set of parameters beginning with v=3 and c=9 (
                        Fig. 15) and again starting with the mean-field model. Even if the cost of escalation is reduced for a high value of resources, doves are still better adjusted. A similar effect is also seen for small values of resources, and despite the fact that the cost is doubled hawks still gain some advantage. For v=12 and c=6 hawks rapidly achieve full domination in the population, without any chances for doves even for relatively large values of r.

Again, for the spatial version the major change is visible within the probabilistic reproduction (
                        
                        Figs. 16 and 17), where the dove’s frequencies of occurrence are increased in comparison with the previous model. This may be explained by the fact that for low r, hawks are less well adjusted. In the case of deterministic reproduction, both phenotypes exists equally in the population (as in the first resources model). The weighted mean reproductions increase the hawk’s frequency of occurrence slightly, which almost equals 1. When benefits are higher than costs (
                        Fig. 18) the weighted mean reproduction for intervals gives outcomes different from those in the previous model—the dove’s frequency is now higher than that of hawks. The other reproductions result in similar populations in terms of the dynamics of changes and also the final structures of the population.

Recent works on the evolutionary dynamics of tumours [17] emphasizes that factors important at the evolutionary level like cell survival and proliferation are pivotal in the development of tumours as heterogeneous populations of different cell types. Moreover, an additional key-factor (for game theory applications) has been studied mainly by Basanta and co-workers [18], which is the impact of the ecosystem or the interactions between tumour cells and their environment. They have already modelled changes in the cancer ecosystem in the context of different anti-cancer therapeutic strategies. From the game theory point of view, during simulation changes appear in the frequency of occurrence of parameters or phenotypes, like those in our simulations of resources for the mean-field model. Further development of spatial games, like that illustrated here by the hawk–dove game, should provide further possibilities of simulating therapies by affecting different players (as elements on the spatial lattice) at a different level or even in a different way. In particular, Basanta and co-workers noted that elimination of as many cancer cells as possible may not be essentially the best strategy. They found that destroying only some fraction of the cancer cells (with a particular phenotype) may be far more efficient. Thus, using spatial games with additional simulations that impact the game (either by a payoff matrix or spatial structures on the lattice) provides a possibility to study this question using a vast amount of different configurations (especially for various initial lattices and simulated environments). Moreover, until now evolutionary games have mainly been used to study changes in a tumour’s phenotypic heterogeneity and its impact on the evolutionary dynamics of cancer (possibility of different interactions, e.g. cooperation). However, the importance of heterogeneity is at the population level, meaning that the population contains different homogenous cells, which is obviously an important limitation arising from the usage of replicator dynamics. MSEG additionally allows for modeling heterogeneity on the cell level within the population, which may be more appropriate for real biological situations. The proposed extension of the mixed spatial games may be applied also to the already existing game theoretic cancer models. For instance growth factors in the angiogenic model [5] can be treated in a similar way as resources in the hawk–dove model. The growth factor can be defined for each spot on the spatial lattice and can be dependent on the parameter j and particular, local configuration of cells A+ (which produce growth parameters with benefits j and costs i) and cells A− (which only use growth factors) on the lattice (Table 4). As a result those factors may impact and change the payoff matrix in a different way for different cells. Such modification can be also used to describe more complex phenomena e.g. in the bystander model [11] (taking into account the role of medium from irradiated cells, see [19]) or production of and resistance to cytotoxic substances model [20] (for instance introducing cytotoxic concentration depending on the spatial allocation of the producers and time).

New understanding of the player (the mixed-strategy) and resources-dependent payoffs introduce asymmetry in the sense that each player may have different payoff matrix, so that even if the phenotypic compositions of two players are the same then the amount of the resources may differ. Asymmetry was already considered even in some early works of Maynard–Smith [15] and some recent applications in two-player, two-action game theoretic model of tumour metabolism [21]. Within this approach each type of cell has a separate payoff matrix. A recent study [22] shows the possibility of training and validating the replicator dynamics equations using population sizes measured in co-culture over time, and the potential clinical implications discussed may enable future development and quantitative application in cancer treatment. However, the equations presented by the authors describe the dynamics of absolute population numbers, while commonly used in game theoretic models replicator dynamics are based on the frequencies of the occurrences (fractions) of the phenotypes existed in the studied population. What is more, training and validating the equations seem to be only the first step. The next one would be to find a correlation between equations’ parameters and the parameters used within the payoff matrix that mainly described the game theoretic based models. First step should allow to obtain a way for simulating and foreseeing dynamic changes in the population due to changing the frequency of occurrences (or the exact number) of the particular phenotype. Second step should allow to predict the changes in the population due to introduced changes in the environment that may impact the way how the cells interact with each other. To our knowledge, so far all comparisons with biological phenomena (in terms of game theoretic carcinogenesis modelling) have been performed only in a qualitative way which, still, may be very complicated in the case of more complex models. Mostly the comparison takes into account only the changes in the frequencies of occurrences of the phenotypes. To our knowledge the evaluation of the payoff matrix parameters is considered only in the one paper [23], where the authors indicate that some anticancer therapies may impact the proposed parameters describing the model.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS@&#

Mixed spatial evolutionary games provide additional possibilities of reproductions and general game realization. For both SEGT and MSEG it is feasible to provide an additional layer where a parallel game is performed. We have chosen MSEGs due to their interpretation of the player and the possibility of rule creation for parallel games based on a phenotype’s frequency of occurrence. In MSEGs these phenotypes are stored on different layers, and yet another layer simulates the environment (resources), in fact giving a multidimensional game. Regardless of the already existing immense amount of parameters and possible configurations of games, they may be modified further by different payoff matrices. We have shown two different models that include parameter changes during the simulation. Hence, the payoff matrix is not stable and it differs for different players. This leads to yet another difficulty in spatial games analysis, since it is disputable to predict the results or even to compare them between MSEG and a multi-layered game. In fact, an additional layer modifies the model significantly, creating a new game. What is interesting is that the spatial allocation factor and new approach seem to give unpredictable results in comparison with those that may be achieved by analysis of payoff matrices. Moreover, changes of the parameters (v and c) and different enhancement models appear to have different effects on different reproductions. So effects observed for one reproduction due to different game configurations (values of parameters, payoff matrices etc.) may have no qualitative (but quantitative) counterparts within other reproductions due to the same changes. Studies of the sensitivity of spatial games are far from being complete, since we neglected some of the possible configurations like different initial lattices, different neighbourhoods, or different numbers of best players or intervals (for weighted mean games). We believe that modelling tumour heterogeneity on the cell level and taking into account the two suggested factors (changes in frequencies and interactions between cells) may fit well as an application to the so called evolutionary double bind model [24], where two different anticancer therapies are used sequentially.

New approaches of spatial evolutionary games have been introduced using the classical hawk and dove model. We hope that MSEG models may contribute to a new generation of mathematical and computational models of carcinogenesis and progression of cancer, based on recent biological findings. These findings were summarized in two famous papers listing the “hallmarks of cancer” [25,26] by Hanahan and Weinberg. These include the “Original Hallmarks”: limitless replicative potential, tissue invasion and metastasis, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, self-sufficiency in growth signals, evading apoptosis and sustained angiogenesis. The “New Generation Hallmarks” include the Enabling Characteristics, such as genome instability and mutation and tumour-promoting inflammation, and Emerging Hallmarks, such as deregulation of cellular energetics and avoidance of immune destruction. The most urgent and obvious question which emerges from this summary is how it is possible that such complex strategies (behaviours) as those observed in cancer could have emerged. Indeed, as stated in a recent review by Ben-Jacob et al. [27], “Despite decades of a much improved understanding of cancer biology, we are still baffled by questions regarding the deadliest traits of malignancy: metastatic colonization, dormancy and relapse, and the rapid evolution of multiple drug and immune resistance”.

Similarly to evolution of organisms, population of cancer cells can be also regarded as evolving system including the stage of mutations’ introduction and selection [28,29]. In comparison to genomes of normal cells, the cancer genomes are characterized by more frequent point mutations, small deletions and insertions, gene fusions and amplifications [30,31]. In [32] over 136000 coding mutations found in 4803 genes were already reported. In addition to that cancer genomes are subjected to large-scale genome alternations, chromosomal rearrangements, translocations and lesions [30,31]. The presence of these ‘catastrophic’ events indicates that cells can tolerate to some extent such changes or even obtained a selective advantage from them. The largest scale alterations in tumour cells lead to the whole genome polyploidizations which result in changes in copy number of chromosomes and to unbalanced number of genes. Our idea to treat individuals as representatives of phenotypes which are mixtures of basic traits with almost continuous spectrum of possible strategies is, in our opinion, one of reasonable approximations of these observations. On the other hand it has been demonstrated in many papers [33,34] that it is necessary to include spatial distribution of signalling among cells as well as competition and cooperation to reproduce essentially random multifocality phenomenon in early cancer.

An important part of the problem we address in this paper is related to the role of environment (resources) modelled by yet another layer of the game. We hope that it may help in answering one of fundamental questions of modern genetic oncology: whether the genetic heterogeneity in cancer cells exists ab initio (i.e., before diagnosis or intervention), and is modified by selection when treatment is applied, or, does it evolve following the treatment and as a result of the intervention.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

Evolutionary game theory (EGT) proposed by John Maynard Smith and George Price links game theory with Darwinian fitness and species evolution. The idea behind this application is that in a population individuals with different phenotypes (strategies) interact with others according to their evolutionary traits without any rationality (following their instincts and encoded behaviour). The result is a payoff and the evolutionary adjustment is termed fitness. In this paper we expand theoretical evolutionary game models by changing the payoff matrix during the transient generations within the population (mean-field model) and by defining the payoff matrix for each player on the lattice (spatial games). For the latter we use extension of the Spatial Evolutionary Game Theory (SEGT) called Mixed Spatial Evolutionary Game (MSEG). MSEG allows introduction of the heterogeneity not only of the population, but also of the particular individuals that may use different strategies (have different and mixed phenotypes in the evolutionary sense). We have chosen the hawk–dove game as a benchmark in the evolutionary games. However, we have considered applying the same machinery for the angiogenic game as yet another example of a two-trait game. In MSEGs phenotypes are stored on different layers, and yet another layer simulates the environment (resources for hawk–dove game) that influences the payoff matrix for each player on the lattice, in fact giving a multidimensional game. The environment layer is changed following simple rules that define how players (with different mixed phenotypes) affects resources taking into account their different heterogeneity and players in the neighborhood.

We have shown two different models that include resource parameter changes during the simulation (for both mean-field and spatial games). Hence, the payoff matrix is not stable and it differs for different players. This leads to yet another difficulty in game theoretical models analysis, since it is disputable to predict the results or even to compare them between different kind of games. Comparison with real, biological data would be another step. There are some interesting and promising suggestions how to train and validate the replicator equations. However, we believe that apply fully the game theoretical models it is necessary to find a way to train and validate the payoff matrices. It would allow to use the simulated scenarios where the number of cells have been changed and where the interaction between cells have been altered by affecting the environment. We believe that modelling tumour heterogeneity (by application of MSEG) on the cell level and taking into account the two suggested scenarios may be efficiently used for the anticancer treatment development (for instance as an application to the so called evolutionary double bind model) .

New approaches of spatial evolutionary games have been introduced using the classical hawk and dove model. Despite the fact that the methods and tools arose for simulation of tumour cell populations, it is possible to apply them also for more complex individuals. The effects and potential interactions, both in macro and micro environments, may be better analysed and understood by spatial factors.
