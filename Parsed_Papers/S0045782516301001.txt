                  We develop a fractional extension of a mass-conserving Allen–Cahn phase field model that describes the mixture of two incompressible fluids. The fractional order controls the sharpness of the interface, which is typically diffusive in integer-order phase-field models. The model is derived based on an energy variational formulation. An additional constraint is employed to make the Allen–Cahn formulation mass-conserving and comparable to the Cahn–Hilliard formulation but at reduced cost. The spatial discretization is based on a Petrov–Galerkin spectral method whereas the temporal discretization is based on a stabilized ADI scheme both for the phase-field equation and for the Navier–Stokes equation. We demonstrate the spectral accuracy of the method with fabricated smooth solutions and also the ability to control the interface thickness between two fluids with different viscosity and density in simulations of two-phase flow in a pipe and of a rising bubble. We also demonstrate that using a formulation with variable fractional order we can deal simultaneously with both erroneous boundary effects and sharpening of the interface at no extra resolution.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The interfacial dynamics of immiscible fluids is of great interest in multi-phase flow systems but computationally not easy to resolve. The common modeling approaches can be broadly divided into two types of sharp- and diffuse-interface models. The sharp-interface models assume a zero-thickness layer that separates the two fluids. The layer is endowed with properties such as surface tension, and matching boundary conditions are imposed on either side of the dividing surface. For numerical simulation of two-phase flow systems with sharp-interface models, moving-grid methods are commonly used with conforming elements around the interface  [1,2]. However, the possibility of mesh entanglement restricts the moving-grid approaches to cases with mild deformation of the interface. Even for such cases, careful remeshing of the domain is required to resolve the interface. In contrast, the diffuse-interface models assume a layer of finite thickness between the two phases. Instead of formulating the flow governing equations in two domains separated by an interface, these methods represent the interfacial tension as a body-force or bulk-stress spreading over a narrow layer covering the interface. This approach yields a unified set of governing equations for the two phases, solved on a fixed grid in a purely Eulerian framework. Numerical methods such as Volume-of-Fluid  [3,4] and level-set  [4,5] have been successfully employed to simulate two-phase flows.

A relatively recent diffuse-interface model for multi-phase flow systems is based on phase fields, long used in materials science problems. The energy-based variational framework of phase-field formulations makes them a thermodynamically-consistent and physically attractive approach to model multi-phase flow systems (cf.  [6–8]). The phase-field model can be viewed as a physically motivated level-set method; however, unlike the level-set model, where an artificial smoothing function is prescribed for the interface, the Cahn–Hilliard model and Allen–Cahn model describe the interface based on the concept of mixing energy. This energy-based description of phase-field models also allows the modeling of complex rheology of non-Newtonian fluids or complex interfacial dynamics to be easily incorporated into the formulation  [9,10]. In this paper we will focus on a new fractional mass-conserving Allen–Cahn model, which we derive from a fractional order mixing energy formulation.

The Allen–Cahn equation was originally introduced to describe the motion of anti-phase boundaries in crystalline solids  [11]. If the phases are immiscible, one can introduce a non-local Lagrange multiplier

                      represented the concentration of one of the two metallic components of the alloy and the parameter

                      represented the interfacial length, which is extremely small compared to the characteristic (large) scale of the system. The homogeneous Neumann boundary condition implies that no mass loss occurs across the boundary walls. In order to demonstrate the mass-conserving property of the constrained Allen–Cahn equation we simulated two-phase flow in a tube with two fluids of different viscosity corresponding to Reynolds numbers

                      we plot the error of the solution in the streamwise velocity obtained based on the constrained Allen–Cahn model but also on the Cahn–Hilliard model; the latter conserves mass, see  [15,16]. We see that the Allen–Cahn model is even more accurate than the Cahn–Hilliard as it employs a second-order operator unlike the Cahn–Hilliard that requires numerical resolution of a fourth-order operator. Attempting to simulate the same problem with the unconstrained Allen–Cahn model would lead to an instability due to the violation of mass conservation. The Allen–Cahn equation can also be viewed as a gradient flow with Lyapunov energy functional

                     . Recently, the Allen–Cahn equation has been widely applied to many complicated moving interface problems, for example, vesicle membranes, nucleation of solids, and mixture of two incompressible fluids, etc. (cf.  [12,17–22]).

Fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs) are generalizations of the integer-order models, based on fractional calculus. They are becoming increasingly popular as a flexible modeling tool for diffusive processes associated with sub-diffusion (fractional in time), super-diffusion (fractional in space) or both. Recently, FPDEs have been applied to diverse fields, including control theory, biology, electro-chemical processes, viscoelastic materials, polymers, finance, etc.; see, e.g.,  [23–34] and the references therein. In particular, fractional diffusion equations have been used to describe the so-called anomalous diffusion phenomenon. In fact, anomalous diffusion is ubiquitous in physical and biological systems where trapping and binding of particles may occur; see, e.g.,  [35–39]. In this paper, we will consider sub-diffusion effects for the phase-field model.

One of the shortcomings of FPDEs is that they are computationally expensive since even low-order discretizations lead to dense matrices due to their non-local character. To this end, direction splitting methods (alternating direction implicit or ADI methods) are powerful techniques, which allow us to split the underlying high dimensional problem into a set of one-dimensional sub-problems, thus reducing considerably the computational complexity for some classical problems (Navier–Stokes equation, diffusion equations, and so on.); see, e.g.,  [40,41]. The ADI scheme we develop below for the fractional phase field model is a straight-forward extension of its counterpart for the traditional diffusion equation  [42,43].

The objective of this paper is to re-formulate the constrained Allen–Cahn equation coupled to Navier–Stokes equations within the fractional calculus framework in order to simulate multi-phase flow systems with tunable sharpness of the interface. The paper is organized as follows. In Section  2 we develop the fractional governing equations. In Section  3 we present the numerical discretization schemes and corresponding convergence results. In Section  4 we present numerical simulations of two-phase flows, including simulations with variable-fractional order. In Section  5 we provide a short summary. In the Appendices we derive an energy law for the fractional Navier–Stokes/phase-field model and also present discretization details along with some convergence results.

                      We can also define the fractional Laplace operator in different ways, but this is still an open issue for bounded domains (cf.  [45–50]). In these papers the fractional Laplacian is often defined through a fractional power of the spectral decomposition of the standard Laplacian. Another possible definition is

                        Remark 2.3
                        We emphasize that there exist several ways to define the fractional gradient and fractional Laplacian. These definitions are not necessarily equivalent to each other, and an energy law is only available for those definitions which possess certain self-adjoint property. An energy law analysis of the new system (2.5)–(2.17)–(2.25), subject to the boundary conditions (2.18)–(2.20), is given in Appendix A
                           Theorem A.1. When the density ratio is large, the Boussinesq approximation is no longer valid, and thus we have to face a fractional momentum equation with variable density. In this case the momentum equations have to be modified in a physically consistent way to obtain an energy law; see also Appendix A for more details.

Next, we reformulate the system (2.4)–(2.14)–(2.17) into an equivalent form, which is more convenient for numerical approximation. Here,

                      in the phase-field equation (2.28) to ensure mass conservation.

In this section we present the direction splitting scheme (ADI) for the phase-field equation, which is second-order in time. In Appendix B, we also provide a similar second-order scheme for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We employ the Legendre spectral method for spatial discretization for constant fractional order, and Petrov–Galerkin method for variable fractional model. We then verify the accuracy of the coupled scheme and quantify its convergence rates for different state variables through a fabricated smooth solution.

In order to solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, we will employ the spectral direction splitting method  [40] based on pressure-stabilization. In Appendix B, we summarize this scheme and present numerical results in order to obtain the convergence rate of the velocity and pressure fields before coupling them to the phase-field.

We used 652 Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto points so the spatial discretization errors are negligible compared with the time discretization error. In Fig. 2
                        , we plot the 
                           
                              
                                 L

                        -errors of the velocity, pressure, and density between the numerical solution and the exact solution at 
                           t
                           =
                           1
                         with different time step sizes and different fractional orders 
                           s
                           =
                           0.85
                         and 
                           s
                           =
                           1.00
                        , respectively. It is clear from Fig. 2 that the scheme is second-order accurate in time for density (i.e., phase-field) and velocity, while the pressure approximation has 1.7-order accuracy in time; the latter is consistent with the results for the Navier–Stokes equation presented in the Appendix B.

Next, we investigate the fractional phase-field equation converging to the integer-order model as the fractional order 
                           2
                           s
                         is approaching 2. We set the forcing term of the phase-field equation equal to the one derived from the exact solutions corresponding to 
                           s

                         we see that the solutions of the fractional phase-field model are approaching the integer-order phase-field solutions with linear convergence with respect to the parameter

In the following, we test the new fractional model for two multi-phase flows: the first one is pipe flow and the second one is a rising bubble in the presence of gravity. We demonstrate that the fractional model recovers the integer-order model but additionally we can control the sharpness of the interface by the fractional order 
                        s
                     . We also address some issues regarding boundary conditions, and to this end we introduce a variable-order fractional model, where the order 
                        s
                      varies in space.

Specifically, the initial and boundary conditions for the two-phase laminar flow are as follows: for velocity, we use the fully-developed velocity profile at the inlet and also as the initial set up:

                        . First, without any flow motion (
                           λ
                           =
                           0
                        ) we test the mass-conserving property of the fractional Allen–Cahn model. We see from the plots of Fig. 5(a) and (b) that the mass of the phase-field is not conserved without the Lagrange multiple 
                           ξ
                           
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                        . We notice that the rectangular bubble quickly deforms into a circular bubble due to the surface tension, while the size of the bubble shrinks and eventually approaches zero size. The decaying rate of the size of the bubble is smaller for the fractional order (
                           s
                           =
                           0.9
                        ) compared to the integer model (
                           s
                           =
                           1.0
                        ). When we employ the constrained Allen–Cahn model mass conservation is valid, and as shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), the initially rectangular bubble approaches a circular bubble in steady state. Table 1
                         shows that discrete mass is conserved in steady state using this model. Fig. 6
                         shows the profiles of the phase field along the horizontal centerline; the interface corresponding to the fractional order (
                           s
                           =
                           0.9
                        ) model is sharper than the integer-order model (
                           s
                           =
                           1.0
                        ). Next, we perform a parametric study to investigate the effect of grid resolution and of the parameter 
                           η
                         governing the interface thickness. Figs. 7 and 8
                        
                         summarize these simulations. It is interesting that for low resolution and small 
                           η
                         the initial square bubble does not achieve a circular shape, the latter being the correct answer obtained for higher resolution and small 
                           η
                        . The smaller fractional order 
                           s
                           =
                           0.75
                         leads to a sharper interface for all resolutions and for all values of 
                           η
                        .

Next, we present numerical simulations of the bubble rising for a low density ratio. In this case all four boundaries are walls with a no-slip flow velocity as boundary condition. The densities are

                        . Specifically, Fig. 9 shows the bubble rising for fractional order

                        . The interface between the bubble and the background fluid is sharper for smaller fractional order, however the rising speed also depends on the fractional order. Moreover, for even smaller values of the fractional order

                         the flow physics we simulate changes substantially corresponding to anomalous diffusion, which has an effect not only on the rising speed but also on the shape of the bubble. This is shown in simulations corresponding to

                         shows the profiles of the phase field at steady state

                        . We can see that the phase-field profiles along the horizontal direction at

                        . The fractional phase-field model causes a boundary layer, due to its non-local nature, see Fig. 11(b). In the next subsection, we will present a variable-fractional order phase-field model that can eliminate this boundary layer artifact.

Fractional calculus allows us to define derivatives of variable order that may depend on time or space or both [56,57]. Hence, we can exploit this new freedom to deal with boundary conditions, discontinuities but also with multi-rate physics that may change locally or in time; see several examples in  [56]. Here, we employ variable-fractional models to remove the artificial boundary layers at the walls in the rising bubble simulations, which were created due to the non-local nature of the fractional operators with fractional order 
                           s
                         smaller than 1; see examples in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 11. Hence, we introduce a variable-fractional order 
                           s

                              y
                              )
                           
                        , i.e., depending on the position, and we choose 
                           s
                           
                           →
                           
                           1
                         close to the walls but maintain 
                           s
                           <
                           1
                         away from the walls where the bubble is located.

This work is of exploratory nature and it represents the first attempt to develop a fractional phase-field model coupled to the fractional incompressible Navier–Stokes equation along with corresponding numerical methods. At first, we considered the Cahn–Hilliard model since the standard Allen–Cahn model does not conserve mass. However, we found through simulations with the integer-order formulation that a constrained Allen–Cahn model not only conserves mass but it also leads to better accuracy for the same resolution compared to the Cahn–Hilliard model as it requires numerical resolution of lower order operators at reduced computational cost. The primary objective of introducing fractional calculus in phase-field formulations is to investigate the possibility of controlling the interface thickness by varying the fractional order. For integer-order formulations, this can be accomplished via the nominal interface thickness 
                        η
                      but this requires additional computational cost and possible adaptive refinement that may weaken the advantages of the Eulerian-based phase-field methods. Surprisingly, we found that we can achieve sharper interfaces by simply tuning the fractional order even at relatively low resolution! However, the introduction of fractional models led also to undesirable effects, e.g. the formation of erroneous boundary layers at the Dirichlet boundaries of the domain, presumably due to the non-local nature of the fractional operators. To this end, we introduced the variable-fractional order approach that allows for a graceful transition of the rate of diffusion from the interior of the domain to the boundaries, and this resolved the problem. Another erroneous effect may be the anisotropic diffusion due to the fractional operators introduced in the current work. We are currently working on other implementations of the fractional Laplacian in bounded domains and we will report these results in future work. A secondary objective of introducing fractional models to conservation laws is to investigate their general utility and better understand the new possibilities enabled within the fractional formalism. For phase-field formulations, in particular, an alternative approach would be to derive formally models “between” the Allen–Cahn and Cahn–Hilliard models by minimizing the free energy in the proper fractional Sobolev norm, instead of the

We first introduce some basic properties of the spaces related to fractional derivatives, and then we prove that the system (2.5)–(2.17)–(2.25) with the definition (2.13) satisfies the energy law.

The fractional operators have following relationships:

For a large density ratio, there is no energy law available for the original system (2.5)–(2.14)–(2.17). This is also true in case of integer order Allen–Cahn phase-field model  [8]. Following the idea in  [62], we can modify the Navier–Stokes equations (2.14)–(2.17) in a physically consistent way to obtain a system which admits an energy law. A critical property of the nonlinear term for the Naiver–Stokes equations (with constant density) is the skew-symmetric property

In this appendix, we will demonstrate that the spectral ADI scheme is an effective method for the Navier–Stokes equation of second-order accuracy in velocity. Specifically, we consider the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equation with constant density and viscosity, i.e.,

                     . Here we consider the Navier–Stokes equation without the advection term (i.e., Stokes flow). The

                              2
                           
                        
                     -velocity errors (sub-figures (a)) is second-order convergence for any time step 
                        Δ
                        t
                      when the space polynomial degree 
                        N
                      is sufficiently large. We also observe that the pressure needs smaller time steps to achieve second-order convergence with the larger polynomial degree 
                        N
                     ; however, it exhibits 
                        
                           
                              3

                     -order convergence if the time step is not small enough. In Fig. B.3
                      we add the advection term into the Navier–Stokes equation. In this case, the errors of velocity and pressure are both larger than the errors of the first test. However, the 
                        
                           
                              L
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     -velocity and even the pressure errors are both second-order for any time step

                     .

Next, we investigate the spectral (exponential) accuracy in space. We plot the results in Fig. B.4
                      for time step 
                        Δ
                        t
                        =
                        1
                        
                           
                              0
                           
                           
                              −

                     . We see that the errors of the velocity and pressure decay exponentially fast with the polynomial degree 
                        N
                     . Then, we use a spectral approximation with 
                        
                           (

                                 N
                              
                           
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 P
                              
                              
                                 N
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      (i.e. the polynomial degrees of velocity and pressure are equal). Although, Fig. B.5
                      shows that the velocity and pressure errors decay exponentially fast with the polynomial degree 
                        N
                     , the solutions are less accurate than the approximation corresponding to 
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 P
                              
                              
                                 N
                              
                           
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 P
                              
                              
                                 N
                                 −
                                 2

                     .

Finally, we compute the extra error of the above splitting method. As we know, this method will add an extra term

                      compared with the standard Crank–Nicolson scheme. Table B.1
                      shows the extra terms and the numerical errors of our whole scheme. The extra term is second-order and comparable to the temporal integration errors, so the overall accuracy of the scheme is second-order in time and exponential in space.

In this appendix we present a spectral method for the spatial discretization, and details of the fully discrete scheme of the fractional phase-field.

                        On the right-hand-side numerical quadratures are only used in the direction in which non fractional derivatives are applied. As it is known that the fractional derivative of a polynomial is no longer a polynomial, and naive applications of Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto quadratures would result in a loss of accuracy. In our implementation, we use an efficient way to evaluate the integrals on the right-hand-sides of (C.7)–(C.9), which is described below. A direct calculation shows

                     . This serves as evidence that the conjectured function (D.6) is a good approximation to the exact equilibrium solution of (D.4).

By using the conjectured equilibrium phase function (D.6), the impact of the fractional order 
                        s
                      on the equilibrium surface tension can be analyzed and numerically investigated in a similar way as above.

We first define the surface tension as follows:
