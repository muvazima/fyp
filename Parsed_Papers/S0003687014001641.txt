                  This exploratory research aims to understand how teams organize themselves and collectively manage risky dynamic situations. The objective is to assess the plausibility of a model of a collective trade-off between “understanding” and “doing”. The empirical study, conducted in the pediatric anesthesia service of a French university hospital, was supported by a “high fidelity” simulation with six teams. Data on the teams' behavior and on the verbal communications were collected through video recordings. The results highlight three modes for management of dynamic situations (determined management, cautious management, and overwhelmed management). These modes are related to the way in which teams manage their cognitive resources. More precisely, they are related to the teams' ability to collectively elaborate a trade-off between “understanding” and “doing”. These results question existing perspectives on safety and suggest improvements in the design of crisis management training (concerning for example the recommendation of “calling for help”).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

System processes are often dynamic, in the sense that they evolve without any intervention of the subjects, such as in nuclear power plants, traffic, and physiological processes (Hoc, 2001; Manser, 2009; Vicente et al., 2004). In such dynamic situations, decision-making is strongly influenced by time constraints, uncertainty, and risk management practices. Each decision requires an evaluation of the consequences of the action under consideration and of the consequences of inaction during the course of the process (Hoc, 2001). These decisions cannot be understood as a simple choice: They are embedded in a complex task setting and they required complex trade-offs (Norros, 2004, 2014; Vicente et al., 2004).

At work, any activity can be described as “collective” and the work of others is itself a major source of situation uncertainty and dynamicity (Hollnagel, 2009; Leplat, 1994). Research must then be conducted to better understand the phenomena associated with collective decisions and their contributions to the management of risky dynamic situations (Salas et al., 2008). Thus, the objective of this research is to understand how teams organize themselves and collectively manage dynamic risky situations. More precisely, we seek to describe the cognitive mechanisms used in this adaptive management. To investigate this question, we rely on both the framework of activity theory and on the works of other authors (Marc and Amalberti, 2002; Marc and Rogalski, 2009a), who propose that the “trade-off model” initially developed to describe individual decision-making can be extended to collective decision-making. After a review of this individual “trade-off model”, we present a model of collective risk management in dynamic situations. An exploratory study was conducted with six anesthesia teams to assess the plausibility of the model. Implications of its results for the design of training programs are then discussed.

Different cognitive activities are involved in the control of dynamic situations: collecting information, detecting problems, diagnosing cues, making sense of the situation, making decisions, acting to solve problems, and so on. Contrary to popular conception, these activities do not occur as a sequence of distinct stages. In reality, they are highly integrated and linked to each other (Amalberti, 1996; Vicente et al., 2004). Detecting a problem, for example, means being able to reconceptualize the situation in order to conceive of it as being problematic (Klein et al., 2005). This requires subjects to participate in the definition of their environment on the basis of knowledge they have elaborated through experience. Understanding in a real context is then an “overall sense-making” process and not a specific stage within a sequential process (detect, diagnose, understand, decide, and act). Basically, “understanding” and “doing” are neither independent nor exclusive activities: “Understanding” is necessary for “doing” just as “doing” allows one to understand (Vicente et al., 2004; Weick, 1993). In other words, these two cognitive activities involved in the management of dynamic situations are complementary and in close interaction (Amalberti, 1996).

In real life situations, resources – especially time – are limited. Thus, these different cognitive activities are not merely complementary: They compete to gain attention (Amalberti, 1996). Many studies describe the dilemmas and the trade-offs that subjects must perform to choose between “doing” and “understanding”. In these studies, the term “trade-off” refers to the compromises and sacrifice decisions made by individuals to achieve success, as explained for example by Hollnagel's efficiency-thoroughness trade-off principle (or ETTO principle) (Hollnagel, 2009; Woods, 2006). These studies reveal that it is often better to do something in time, even approximately, rather than to achieve a complete understanding of events and provide a perfect answer too late (Hollnagel, 2009; Sebillotte, 1984; Senach, 1984). This means that under a time constraint, subjects regulate their performance to achieve the main objectives of the task without consuming too many cognitive resources. This regulation allows them to keep resources “in reserve” in case conditions change unexpectedly. Thus the goal of the subject in dynamic situations is neither to have a thorough understanding nor to perfectly control the process. Gaining a thorough understanding would require the subject to use all available pieces of information to detect inconsistencies. For instance, doing so could involve reading through the patient's file, getting in touch with the surgeon or with colleagues to know how the surgery was conducted, and so on. This refers to the elaboration of a detailed representation of the situation and of its evolution as a whole. The development of such an understanding takes time because it requires the collection and assembly of pieces of information that may be distant in time and space. In reality, under time constraints, the goal is rather to keep the system within a “safe enough” envelope, while preserving resources and the capacity to act in parallel. It is this reserve that ensures effective work in the long run: It saves resources, regulates the workload, and manages and prioritizes concerns (Hoc and Amalberti, 1999).

Paradoxically, the optimal management of the current situation may then lead subjects to adjust their own performance in a suboptimal way (partial representations, misunderstandings, errors, approximations, non-compliance, etc.). For example, the subject can decide to act “without understanding everything”, that is, more or less approximately, following an “erratic mode”, in order to make the process converge towards a “window of stability” (Amalberti, 1996; Hollnagel and Woods, 2005). This window of stability allows the subject, in a second step, to invest in a deeper understanding of the problem with less risk. Conversely, subjects can also decide to postpone some emergency management actions that could a priori be seen as obvious responses. Such strategies aim to enhance their understanding of the problem, while waiting, for example, for the evolving situation to provide further information before they change its course (Amalberti, 1992). In summary, a large part of subjects' activity in dynamic situations consists in regulating their workloads over time to avoid being overloaded. Such regulation of their own workloads is based on their ability to make strategic trade-offs between “doing” and “understanding” (Hoc et al., 2004; Vicente et al., 2004).

The relationships between teamwork and risk management have been investigated by several authors (Manser, 2009; Nyssen, 2007; Salas et al., 2008). They are often discussed from the perspective of traditional approaches concerning accident prevention and error management. From this perspective, the impact of “collective work” on safety is mainly evaluated in relation to the possible occurrence of failures. This impact is twofold. On one hand, collective work may be “a reliability factor” in addition to individual contributions; on the other it may also be a source of failure (Nascimento and Falzon, 2012; Sasou and Reason, 1999). Currently, much research (such as research conducted from the “resilience engineering” perspective) considers safety as an active front-line process and underlines the need to understand how safety and efficiency are both actually created and challenged in the real world by workers (Hollnagel et al., 2006). This perspective is particularly developed in the field of patient safety: “Balancing the work system and encouraging the active and adaptive role of workers are key principles for improving healthcare quality and patient safety” (Carayon et al., 2014).

Many studies in high-risk systems, including medicine, are conducted to understand how teams manage dynamic conditions (Burtscher et al., 2010; Grote et al., 2010; Klein et al., 2006; Tschan et al., 2011). They show that “adaptation is a key coordination process” and that managing errors and preventing harm are “the main coordination functions of team coordination” (Kolbe et al., 2011; Manser, 2009; Zala-Mezö et al., 2009). Some studies try to depict the dynamics of team adaptation in dynamic situations but this term “is still a rather elusive and ill-defined concept within the psychological literature” (Kolbe et al., 2011). Generally speaking, in the above mentioned studies, adaptation is understood as “the response to actual or anticipated changes in the embedding contexts” (McGrath and Tschan, 2004, p. 6). Similarly, “team adaptation is defined as a change in team performance, in response to a salient cue or cue stream, that leads to a functional outcome for the entire team” (Burke et al., 2006, p. 1190). These models suggest that the activity of team members emerges from the context of a given situation.

Activity theories consider that the activity of the human agent has a dual orientation: productive on one hand – that is, targeting task fulfillment – and constructive on the other – elaborating new resources and new knowledge (Daniellou and Rabardel, 2005; Kaptelinin and Nardi, 2006). Such a perspective brings out the active and creative dimension of human adaptation (Falzon, 2014; Rabardel and Pastré, 2005). It contradicts the model of a passive or reactive subject who adjusts to meet contextual demands. Here, the assumption is that the context can be a deliberate output of the action. “People consciously and deliberately generate contexts in part through their own objects; hence context is not just ‘out there’” (Nardi, 1996, p. 76). Adaptation is not seen only as the modification of behavior in response to external constraints. Adaptation is also (and above all) the active transformation of the context by subjects according to their objectives (Béguin, 2003, 2007; Norros, 2004).

Based on the concept of “adaptation” in activity theory, some researchers have suggested that teams involved in real dynamic situations operate in a way compatible with the existence of a double trade-off between “understanding” and “doing” (Marc and Amalberti, 2002; Marc and Rogalski, 2009a,b). The first trade-off occurs at the individual level, where subjects continually adjust a trade-off between “understanding” and “doing” to regulate their own workload (cf. Section 2.1). The collective trade-off model suggests that a second trade-off is performed at the group level, as if the team operates as a “single subject”, with its own trade-off. The core idea of this collective trade-off model is twofold:
                              
                                 1.
                                 The global performance that is sought is “imperfect” (i.e. not thorough, see Section 2.1).

The team elaborates a trade-off between “understanding” and “doing”.

These two points are explained below.

First, the overall performance targeted by the team is not a perfect, error-free performance but a “safe enough”, suboptimal performance. The goal of the teams is primarily efficiency over time, sometimes taking risks and acting in a non-standard way (i.e. deviating from prescribed rules and committing “errors”). This is particularly evident in patient safety when “health production” sometimes means “to save the patient's life”. For example, in a study conducted in an Emergency Medical Service (EMS) unit, Marc and Amalberti (2002) show that errors produced within the team are not always detected and, when detected, are not systematically addressed and corrected. This tacit acceptance of a flow of errors and approximations in the group is explained by the objective to preserve cognitive resources within the team.

Second, the model states that the team elaborates a trade-off between “understanding” and “doing”. This means that the team may “choose” (implicitly) at some time to focus on understanding the problem (gathering information, interacting with colleagues, thinking aloud, etc.), even if this may delay action. At other times, the team may “choose” to focus on action, without necessarily fully understanding the situation (without taking the time to read the file, without discussing the case, without identifying the causes of problem, etc.). The priority given to understanding or to acting (“doing”) according to the situation is the result of a trade-off decision-making process. The intent of the trade-off is to change the context, to alter the situation dynamic in order to adapt it to team resources (knowledge and skills of team members, problem representation, access to information, etc.). In other words, the trade-off allows the team to take command of the situation – to gain control of time. The goal is to produce context instead of suffering from it.

The objective of our research is to understand how teams organize themselves and collectively manage dynamic situations: how groups manage risks and opportunities for the system to work under varying conditions and under time constraints. Specifically, what are the cognitive mechanisms of this collective adaptive management? Activity theory can open new paths to meet these goals. Some works suggest the existence of a “collective cognitive trade-off” (Marc and Amalberti, 2002; Marc and Rogalski, 2009a). This current qualitative and exploratory study attempts to assess the plausibility of that model (Le Moigne, 1995).

Anesthesia consists of inducing a reversible lack of awareness to allow patients to undergo surgery without distress and pain. Classically, the process of anesthesia for a surgical operation is divided into three phases: the “induction” phase, the “maintenance” phase, and the “recovery” phase. During these three phases, the anesthetist supervises and controls the “patient-process”. This expression underlines the fact that the patient's condition can be characterized as a dynamic process because it evolves even in the absence of any action from the subject (De Keyser and Nyssen, 1993; Hoc et al., 2004; Xiao, 1994). The supervision and control of this “patient-process” is provided collectively. Anesthetists are accompanied by nurses, but remain the initiators of care protocols. In particular, the two phases of maintenance and recovery can be supported by nurses alone, provided that the latter are specialized in anesthesia and that the anesthetist can intervene at any time.

Throughout the process, cooperation among members of the anesthesia team presents a synchronous dimension: It requires that teammates coordinate actions or events to maintain desired temporal interrelationships between them (Nyssen and Javaux, 1996). Moreover, cooperation in anesthesia teams is also a “vertical one” (Rogalski, 1994): Anesthetists are responsible for the “mission” and they delegate the fulfillment of some tasks to one nurse (or more). In a traditional view of risk management, this vertical dimension of cooperation is equated with the notion of “leadership”, in the sense that it refers to the idea of “making do” (Künzle et al., 2010a,b; Salas et al., 2007). However, recent works in the field of patient safety have shown that, to be effective, leadership must also include a horizontal dimension of cooperation. Such leadership approaches – where all team members perform leadership functions – are called “adaptive leadership” (Künzle et al., 2010b; Xiao et al., 2004). We observed this approach in the two hospitals under study. Thus, all team members can be involved in the process of problem solving, and so, in particular, in the two dimensions of collective activity: “understanding” and “doing”.

Our research was supported by a high fidelity simulator which recreates, in the form of a mannequin, the physiological and pharmacological reactions of a 6-month-old infant (SimBaby™), including breathing, vocalizations, palpable pulses, and a realistic airway that can be intubated. The interactive mannequin reacts to the actions of participants based on a software program developed by anesthesiology trainers (Banerjee et al., 2007; Kofke and Nadkarni, 2007; Nyssen et al., 2002). This equipment was used to develop an exploratory study. The advantage of such a study is twofold. First, it makes it possible to observe the management of risky dynamic situations: situations that are difficult to observe and describe in actual practice. Furthermore, the realization of an experimental study using a simulator enables one to conduct a comparative analysis between teams on a single scenario and then to identify differences in how they manage critical events.

The experimental scenario, designed by a senior anesthetist, is an emergency situation due to an airway problem in the recovery room (extubation). It is a classic and simple scenario in the sense that airway problems (such as extubation mishaps) are very common during the recovery phase: Anesthesia teams are used to handle them regularly. In other words, this scenario does not simulate a crisis or a severe event (such as a cardiac arrest or malignant hyperthermia, which are commonly simulated) but rather a “non-routine event” which “usually” does not have a substantial negative effect on the patient (Burtscher et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the anesthetist who designed the case considered it to be a plausible incident, in the sense that it could actually take place and presented real risks if not quickly understood and corrected. Subjects who took part in the simulation did not discuss the plausibility of the case.

As a matter of fact, in France, when a child's medical condition is stable and considered safe, parents are allowed to enter the recovery room. In the scenario, the endotracheal tube, which ensures the artificial respiration of the baby patient, is moved “accidentally” (extubation) by his father (an actor). This blocks the flow of oxygen to the lungs. According to experts in anesthesia, in order to solve the problem the team must proceed in two steps:
                           
                              1.
                              The emergency management step consists in manipulating and completely removing the tube accidentally moved by the father;

The control step consists in re-intubating to oxygenate the child appropriately while ensuring protection of the airway.

In these two tasks, one cannot dissociate activities related to the task to be performed (taskwork) and activities oriented towards the team and it coordination (teamwork) (Salas et al., 2008): The two aspects are impossible to separate. A team member's action always has a double orientation: toward the task and toward the other members. No action can be solely task-oriented, independent of the team, because all actions contribute to collective work. Similarly, no action can be solely team-oriented. Even communicative actions also have a task orientation. For example, requesting a colleague to pass the mask (a communicative action) is both team- and task-oriented. Likewise, performing an intubation (a behavioral action) is necessarily completed in interaction with a colleague; even if no verbal interactions occur, one can notice non-verbal communications and coordinated actions.

The simulated scenario was performed by six anesthesia teams in order to make comparisons using a qualitative method (Santiago Delefosse, 2006). Because of constraints related to the use of the simulator and the availability of physicians and nurses, these sessions were conducted in the context of training sessions. These were short training courses (about one day), during which teams worked through several scenarios and were then debriefed. The test scenario was run during these days, to benefit from the installation of equipment and from the presence of the teams. Sampling could not be fully controlled. This generated some differences in the composition of teams (see Table 1
                        ). The anesthetists are senior residents (except one who is a junior anesthetist, not a resident, but this does not affect his functional role) and have approximately the same level of seniority. Nurses have different levels of seniority but have specialized in anesthesia for more than five years. Thus, they can apply anesthesia techniques (perfusion, tracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, etc.) but only under the supervision of an anesthetist. Furthermore, the latter remains the sole initiator of care protocols. Members of these teams may know each other but do not work together regularly. This reflects the usual composition of teams: In practice, teams are formed in a “more or less” ad hoc way, depending on the presence and availability of each member, and on the schedules of services.

Data were collected through video recordings. Data analysis was inductive and, in agreement with activity theory, was always completed considering “activity” and not only “task”. In short, that means that data analysis was completed considering “work as done” (i.e. what actually happens in the current variable conditions with an intrinsic viewpoint) and not “work as imagined” (i.e. work as designers, managers, regulators, and authorities believe it happens or should happen). This inductive analysis was carried out in two steps: First, the analysis focused on the teams' behavior, through observation of the patient's evolution and of the nurses and anesthetist's non-verbal actions; second, it focused on the verbal communications exchanged within teams. The first step (observation of the behavior) accounts for “doing” because it reveals the commitment of the team in action, while the second step (verbal communications) allows one to access the “understanding” dimension of the trade-off. The first author coded both the behavior and the verbal interactions, using coding units that are described in sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2. The results were then validated by the second author and two expert anesthetists. Since we consider that all actions, verbal or not, contribute to teamwork and taskwork (cf. §3.2), these two analyses consider both taskwork and teamwork.

The analysis of the behavior aims to describe and compare the actions performed by each of the six teams to solve the problem and manage the risks to the patient. The objective is to account for the commitment of the team in action, without considering who performs these actions within the team (collective doing). Systematic observations are based on the collection of four categories of observable events: “actions on ventilation”, “calls for help”, “team composition” and “saturation”. The “action on ventilation” is the most important category because it describes the various ways to ventilate the child (manual ventilation, automatic ventilation, natural ventilation, extubation, etc.). As the problem addressed in the scenario concerns ventilation, this category can account for the actions performed by teams to handle the critical situation, from its origin (extubation by the father) until its resolution. In particular, this category of observable events allows one to distinguish the two steps in the resolution of the problem: the emergency management step and the control step (see § 3.2.).

The “calls for help” category indicates any requests for additional assistance made by the anesthesia teams to strengthen them team to face the emergency. The “composition of the team” reflects changes to team membership by mentioning the successive arrivals of new participants (not actors) and by indicating their function (anesthetists or nurses). The “saturation” is the numerical measure of the percentage of oxygen in the patient's blood. This value is recorded from the real-time monitoring of the child throughout the procedure. It allows one to account for changes in the health of the patient and therefore to describe the dynamic process that the team must control.

This behavior analysis of video-recorded non-verbal actions was conducted with Actogram Kronos™ software (Kerguelen, 1991, 1997). The first author coded the observable events. This allows the analyst to establish sequences of actually performed actions. The results are presented in the form of chronological graphs known as “activity chronicles”. These graphs highlight in particular the two steps to be carried out (the emergency management step and the control step according to the task analysis) and the actual time used by teams to perform these two steps (d1 and d2 in Fig. 1
                           ).

In addition to behavior analysis, verbal communications exchanged during the simulation sessions were recorded on video, fully transcribed, and analyzed by a single ergonomist using systematic coding. During transcription, the dynamic evolution of speech was taken into account through a timed record every 30 s. Transcribed communications were then categorized (Walker, 2005). This categorization was inductive and conducted independently from the behavior analysis. Following the activity theory approach, the analysis seeks to decipher the goals of team members (Engestrom, 2000; Kaptelinin and Nardi, 2006), rather than to identify entities or mechanisms. The coding scheme is based on a functional typology (Hoc and Amalberti, 1999) that accounts for different levels of representation of the situation by subjects according to the aims they pursue: from a “concrete” level about objects handled, to more “abstract” levels concerning concepts, models, and knowledge. Our functional typology is also in line with the time scale: It takes into account the temporal variables and actions vis-à-vis the changing dynamics of the situation – from the local management of the situation in the short term, to the management of data external to the process, the consequences of which are evaluated in the longer term. This coding scheme distinguishes four exclusive categories: action-oriented communications, informative communications, understanding-oriented communications and agreement-oriented communications (Table 2
                           ). The number of utterances in each category is computed during periods of 30 s to show the temporal distribution of communications.

In this study, the analysis especially focuses on the “understanding-oriented communications” to identify periods more dedicated to the understanding of the problem by the teams (Fig. 2
                           ). These communications aim to collect “initial” or “complementary” data regarding the ongoing process to build a more elaborate, more coherent, and deeper representation of the situation. They reveal the commitment of the partners towards a collective reasoning to establish the logic underpinning the evolving process and to identify the causes of the problem. This category refers partially to the concept of “explicit reasoning”, as indicated by the occurrence of words such as “therefore”, “because” and the like (Tschan et al., 2009). Here, the influence of the data exchanged on the course of action takes place in the relatively long term, following the reasoning carried out by team members on the basis of their general knowledge. This category includes in particular communications such as “diagnosis”, which capture whether the problem is solved (valid diagnosis) or not (false diagnosis). It may be mentioned here that such “understanding communications” do not preclude acting (“doing”). Most of the time, the actions taking place along with such communications are related to the research and sharing of information (read medical records, phone call, etc.) and not to the immediate management of the “patient-process”.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The results from the behavior analysis allowed us to identify three modes of managing dynamic situations: determined management, cautious management, and overwhelmed management (Fig. 3
                           ). “Determined management” (two teams) is characterized by a rapid succession of steps to manage the emergency (moving the tube to oxygenate the patient) and to control long-term risks (re-intubate the patient), thereby saving the patient's life: These two steps are carried out with an interval of less than 2 min. In that case, we note that the teams did not call for help.

“Cautious management” (three teams) also ensures the success of the mission. However, in this case, two temporally distant steps are observed. Initially, the emergency is managed (mobilization of the tube in order to manually oxygenate the patient). Then, after a long delay (at least 5 min later), the patient is re-intubated so as to avoid long-term risks (control step). During this interval of time between the two steps, the child is in a stable state: Saturation has regained a constant high level, which means the child is no longer in immediate danger. Finally, we note that two of the three teams that handled the situation in a “cautious way” made “calls for help” to get the backing of senior anesthetists.

“Overwhelmed management” (one team) is characterized by a very long delay before the resolution of the situation, which leads to the failure of the takeover: The life of the patient is saved in the simulation but would not have been saved in reality. Here, the first step in managing the emergency occurs only 9.5 min after the arrival of the anesthetist. This team formulated several calls for help.

The communication analysis (focusing on understanding communication) yielded three types of team behaviors. Teams differ in the way in which comprehension interactions are organized: at the beginning of the scenario (when the anesthetist arrives cf. Fig. 2), in the middle of the scenario (the anesthetist has been present for 3 min at least), or dispersed throughout the scenario. Though conducted independently, the two inductive analyses (on behavior and communications) converge in that the three communication types correspond to the three modes of management. In other words, the results of the analysis of “understanding-oriented communications” complemented and reinforced the identification of the three modes for management of dynamic situations (cf. Table 3
                           ).

In “determined management” (two teams), analyses of verbal exchanges show that the communications aimed at understanding the problem were mainly grouped within a short period, when the anesthetist arrived to handle the situation. We note also that, in that case, the anesthetists made the first valid diagnosis to explain the problem. Conversely, in “cautious management”, we see that the problem is already partially solved by nurses when the anesthetist arrives to handle the situation. Communications aimed at understanding problems also mainly take place during a short period, but this time they do not occur when the anesthetist arrives, but later, once the emergency is managed and before the patient is re-intubated (that means between the emergency management step and the control step). Finally, we observe in “overwhelmed management” that understanding-oriented communications do not occur within a specific period, but are numerous and dispersed throughout the management of the situation. And we note that in this case, when the anesthetist arrives to handle the child, the diagnosis is far from being resolved.

The different modes used by teams to manage dynamic situations are not related to the nature of the risk to the patient (which is identical for all teams). Instead, they are related to the way in which teams manage the situation according to their cognitive resources. This differs from one team to another. “Determined” and “cautious” management modes have both saved the child. And they both include particular moments during which the understanding of the problem is investigated more deeply and collectively. This is not the case when management is overwhelmed.

When management is “determined”, the problem is understood collectively as soon as the anesthetist comes into the room, during a short period mainly devoted to verbal exchanges aimed at understanding the situation. The diagnosis is then made quickly by the anesthetist and shared with the teammates. In other words, the teams begin here to collectively understand the problem before performing the emergency and control actions (doing). Thereafter, these actions and the subsequent course of the situation confirm the shared understanding of the problem. The team maintains control of the situation, without the need to set aside misunderstood details. We can hypothesize that this control without misunderstanding explains the absence of a “call for help”.

In “cautious management”, the anesthetist arrives when an etiological diagnosis has already been proposed by the nurse (at least partially). The anesthetist acknowledges this diagnosis, and the team adopts this “sufficiently consistent” understanding, thus managing the emergency quickly, at the cost of a limited shared-understanding of the problem. In other words, the teams act “without understanding everything” to make the process converge towards a window of stability and to gain “margins of maneuver”. These incomplete interpretations may explain the frequent calls for help expressed by some members of these teams.

Subsequently, these “margins of maneuver” allow team members to invest in a deeper understanding of the problem. It is why they postpone the control step that could a priori be seen as obvious. In fact, this strategy enables them to strengthen their understanding of the problem; it can be analyzed as a “cautious behavior” in favor of sustainable safety. Meanwhile, many communications are exchanged in order to collectively describe in detail, to explain, and to understand the problem. Without such understanding, the patient is exposed to another danger: that of loss of control over the possible evolution of the patient's health, related to accumulation of incomplete or inaccurate interpretations of the event.

Overwhelmed management results in a failure to cope with the situation. Emergency management is performed too late to save the baby (the life of the patient is saved in the simulation but would not have been saved in reality). Whatever the possible causes of this failure, the fact is that it is correlated with a lack of management of cognitive resources within the team: There is no period dedicated to the understanding of the problem. Communications to build a deeper representation of the problem are miscellaneous and dispersed throughout the process, meaning in this case that a trade-off between “understanding” and “doing” is not established within the team: The team neither acts immediately nor temporizes in order to understand.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

These results support the model of a collective trade-off between “understanding” and “doing”. As a matter of fact, “successful” teams (i.e. teams that build up an effective management method, whether determined or cautious) act along the lines of the “collective cognitive trade-off model”. First, the performance of these teams is imperfect: Some do not call for help, some act without being sure of the diagnosis, and some postpone the control step and lose speed. Secondly, these teams set up periods to gain understanding and periods to act. They transform the context (especially the temporal environment) to fit their own needs and resources (see Fig. 4
                        ). In other words, they manage the allocation of time, alternating periods specifically dedicated to action with others focusing on understanding in order to regain control of the unfolding situation. Establishing such a balance requires that compromises be made within the team, and that the compromises be accepted by all. Most often, these trade-offs are implicit: They are not explicitly discussed, and their selection criteria are not verbalized. Their existence is revealed by periods specifically dedicated to understanding and others dedicated to action. These extremely subtle and implicit trade-offs are at the core of adaptability.

The results show that the organization of these periods for “doing” and for “understanding” differs according to the mode of management (determined or cautious). However, in both cases, success appears as related to a suitable alternation of “understanding” and “doing”. Finally, what is important is that teams know how to devise these trade-offs and how to choose the management style that suits them best at a given time, and in a particular context. This decision takes into account two risks: the immediate risk to the patient and the longer-term risk for the team, in relation to management of the collective resources needed to cope with the situation (Cuvelier et al., 2012).

The inability to set up an appropriate trade-off between “understanding” and “doing” within the team leads to the loss of control over the process, as can be seen in the “overwhelmed” management mode. In this case, no time is devoted to understanding: All members seek to solve the problem in a scattered way throughout the scenario. This scattering reflects the lack of trade-off in the team and results in a failure to adapt. The team responds to cues from the environment and to contextual changes but cannot adapt the environment to suit its resources.

These results have important implications for training. They will be discussed after presenting the limitations of the study.

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

These results have limitations that require further study. First, they are derived from a study of only six specific teams (Leplat, 1997). While we agree that this is indeed a limit, it is unavoidable in practice, as it is not feasible to have access to a large number of anesthetic teams. According to Falzon, in order to generalize in such cases, it is necessary to “use a trick: the work of others” (1998, p. 8). This is the idea of the current study, which is a continuation of other work (Marc and Amalberti, 2002; Marc and Rogalski, 2009b) so as to constitute a “collective practice of replication” (Gadbois and Leplat, 2004, p. 16).

Second, the study is conducted in a simulated context, not in real situations. It is an open question whether the observed behaviors would be the same in a real context. In particular, would the “overwhelmed management” team have behaved the same in a real situation? This is not possible to determine. However, there is a large body of literature on the use of simulators and the validity of the results they provide (Béguin and Pastré, 2002; Béguin and Weill-Fassina, 1997; Daniellou, 2007; Nyssen, 2005; Nyssen and De Keyser, 1998). One common observation is that teams involved in training sessions on high-fidelity simulators become very involved in the situations they are asked to manage and seem to behave in a realistic way.

Finally, it would have been better to complete our analysis by collecting “a posteriori” the subjects' viewpoints on their sessions so as to “catch from within” the way in which the subjects constructed their collective activity (Daniellou and Rabardel, 2005). This would have helped to validate the inferences we made from behaviors and verbal communications. Interview methods such as “allo- or auto-confrontation” would have been good candidates for this analysis (Mollo and Falzon, 2004).

According to our results, the effectiveness of collective management of dynamic situations is correlated to the achievement of a collective trade-off between “understanding” and “doing”. The question raised is then: Which concrete applications can we draw from these results? In other words, if team performance is correlated with the ability to collectively choose a trade-off between understanding and doing, it is necessary to devise ways to help teams make such trade-offs. One might ask in particular what kind of training could be developed for this purpose.

A first consequence of the model is that, for a team to be efficient, it should be able to accept deficiencies and approximations in order to keep control of the situation, even over the long term. Thus the shortcomings and imperfections identified are not simply regarded as non-compliant behavior or as potential causes of accidents. They are above all the results of the trade-off made by the teams to adapt and keep sufficient control over the process, including long-term control. For example, “calling for help” is favorable to the immediate management of the problem. This behavior is actually identified as a “good practice” by experts. It is recommended in traditional training (Fletcher et al., 2004). However, “calling for help” is also costly vis-à-vis organizational constraints (Cuvelier and Falzon, 2010). Systematically calling for help, even when not “totally necessary”, may even be harmful in the long term (for the risk management of future patients or for patients of other services). In this sense, the absence of “call for help” in the determined management mode can be interpreted as a source of safety (Cuvelier, 2011). Similarly “taking time” once the process is partially mastered is not a loss of time that may increase the short-term risks for the patient (because it increases the risk of spasms): It is a way to build a deeper shared representation, in favor of sustainable control over the patient-process. If a new, unexpected event happens, the team will be better able to cope. In other words, the choice of “taking time” once the child is out of immediate danger is a cautious attitude vis-à-vis the management of the team's cognitive resources, because it allows team members to develop a coherent and shared understanding.

From this perspective, “optimal risk management” does not correspond to management in keeping with indicators, criteria, and measures previously established by experts (speed, call for help, leadership, etc.). Here, “optimal management” allows the system to achieve its goals (preserve the patient's health) while remaining within “acceptable” safety margins (and not “ideal” or “perfect” boundaries). In this sense, learners must be trained to tackle situations that do not yet exist (Engeström, 2010). This consists in helping teams to make the best trade-off decisions between understanding and doing, given the complexity of real situations and their own resources (physical, organizational, but also individual, such as memory, vigilance, attention, etc.). For example, this may consist in teaching teams how to assess their mastery of the situation, so that they call for help (doing) if, and only if, they feel that the situation may get out of their control (understanding). This supposes development of the teams' skills to evaluate their skills and resources and of their management (meta-knowledge). And development of such a capacity requires that individuals and teams take (and are given) time to analyze their own activity (Falzon and Sauvagnac, 2001). This requires specific training sessions during which ergonomists and psychologists assist activity analysis for reflective practice (Rudolph et al., 2007). A way to achieve this can be, in our example, to conduct training based on real cases of “calls for help”, provided that these training sessions are conducive to reflective practice (Mollo and Falzon, 2004; Schön, 1983).
