                  While the interest in higher-order models in physics and mechanics grows, their numerical simulation still poses a challenge, especially for arbitrary shaped three-dimensional domains. This contribution presents the mathematical framework as well as the application to different problems in the field of material science, fracture mechanics and diffusion problems. All models under consideration require at least

                  Introducing isogeometric analysis (IGA) for the discretization in a finite element framework enables us to deal with these requirements. Moreover, a general hierarchical refinement scheme based on a subdivision projection is presented here for one, two and three dimensional simulations. This technique allows to enhance the approximation space using finer splines on each level but preserves the partition of unity as well as the continuity properties of the original discretization.
                  Using this mathematical framework, the improved convergence of a Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model, a mesh-adapted thermal diffusion simulation and computations of a priori unknown crack propagation in different fracture modes underline the versatility of the presented hierarchical refinement scheme.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Phase-field models have gained raising attention for numerical simulations of a broad range of physical phenomena throughout the past years. In combination with finite element based solution strategies they enable a fascinating variety of multi-field and multi-physics simulations, cf.  [1–5] and many others. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the presented mathematical framework an in-depth investigation of a series of higher-order problems is presented.

We start with a Kuramoto–Sivashinsky system, cf.  [6,7,3]. The Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model has been derived for the simulation of different thermodynamical systems far away from equilibrium state, e.g., fluctuations in fluid films and instabilities in laminar flame fronts, see, Paniconi and Elder  [3], among many others. This transient fourth-order evolution equation accounts for the physics of arising chaotic instabilities in the spatial as well as the temporal domain and allows us to investigate the consistency as well as the convergence of local refinement schemes in one and two dimensions. The numerical solution of the fourth-order operator is traditionally realized using finite difference schemes. In the context of FEA for irreducible systems, global 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      continuity is required, see Gomez and Paris  [6] for the application of NURBS basis functions.

To demonstrate the capabilities in three dimensions we study a higher-order phase-field approach to brittle fracture within a fully non-linear framework along with a structure-preserving time integration, cf.  [8,9]. Classical brittle fracture mechanics of Griffith and Irwin  [10,11] states that material fails locally upon the attainment of a specific fracture energy. Based on this theory phase-field methods provide a modern tool to numerically predict a priori unknown crack paths. This specific methodology relies on a variationally consistent formulation of an augmented multi-field energy functional, taking the fracture energy within an additional field equation into account. The approach has proven to be accurate and robust in two and three dimensions, see Miehe et al.  [12] among many others.

Here, we propose a novel framework for general non-linear hyperelastic material models combined with a fourth-order phase-field model along with the hierarchical refinement scheme presented above. The approach for finite elasticity relies on a multiplicative decomposition of the local deformation field into a compressive and a tensile part, as proposed in Hesch and Weinberg  [13], i.e., we assume that local stress induces fracturing only for tension, once a certain critical energy has been reached. The applied fourth-order model for the phase-field has been proposed in Borden et al.  [8] to improve accuracy and convergence using the superior regularity of a higher-order phase-field.

Eventually, a two and three dimensional model of temperature controlled diffusion in a polymer blend is investigated, cf.  [14]. In consequence of different chemical potentials of both substances diffusion will be triggered and the blend starts to decompose into two different phases. Here the order parameter of the phase field marks the mass concentration 
                        c
                      in the domain, with 
                        0
                        ≤
                        c
                        ≤
                        1
                     . In analogy to the previously presented phase-field model of brittle fracture, the interface between coexisting phases is a transition region of small but finite length where the order parameter changes rapidly but smoothly.

For the numerical calculations, we aim at a consistent discretization of the underlying partial differential equations in contrast to mixed approaches, which are computational inefficient due to the arising large number of unknowns. Here, we apply an isogeometric analysis (IGA) approach, which employs Non-Uniform rational B-Splines (NURBS) as finite element basis functions. NURBS basis functions allow to predefine the basis functions’ continuity within their construction, see Cottrell et al.  [15] for a comprehensive review. The underlying splines have local support but are not restricted to a single finite element; in the multivariate case they have a tensor product structure. These specific properties, however, turn into a major drawback for the construction of local refinement procedures which are necessary for large-scale, three-dimensional systems with locally sharp gradients or other local areas of interest.

To solve these mesh-subdivision problems T-splines have been introduced in the IGA to break the tensor product structure of the spline base, see Bazilevs et al.  [16]. Because additional knots are inserted into the structure, the arising T-junctions can be considered as the IGA version of hanging nodes of standard FEA. As shown in Scott et al.  [17] such refinement algorithms improve the quality of approximation but become very complex in three-dimensional domains. Additionally, restriction on the polynomial degree, on the linear dependence of T-spline blending functions and on the locality of the refinement are known.

An alternative to the element-based mesh-subdivision procedures provides the hierarchical superposition of shape functions. Such refinement methods are long known from high-order FEA, see, e.g. the work of Szabò and Babuška  [18], and for B-splines they have already been introduced by Forsey and Bartels  [19]. Recently, such refinements have been applied within the framework of IGA, see, e.g. Vuong et al.  [20], Evans et al.  [21] and Scott et al.  [22]. The basic idea behind a hierarchical refinement is simple: B-spline and NURBS basis functions are replaced on the refined level by a linear combination of scaled and copied versions of themselves, i.e. the refinement concept relies on a subdivision of the underlying NURBS functions. This procedure maintains the global properties in terms of smoothness and continuity of the unrefined mesh at the cost of a non-trivial implementation. Extensions to the multivariate case are possible. Although the general concept of hierarchical refinement is straightforward, in detail the realizations within the FEA differ. For the application to arbitrary shaped domains, we present a novel extension of the refinement scheme in order to preserve the partition of unity property in case of repeated knots.

The outline of the paper is as follows: In Section  2, we recall the concept of isogeometric analysis and introduce the hierarchical refinement procedure in detail. In Section  3 the temporal discretization is outlined in a general way. Applications to demonstrate the capabilities of the refinement scheme are presented in Section  4. In particular, the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model is presented in Section  4.1, Section  4.2 addresses the higher-order phase-field model of fracture mechanics, and in Section  4.3 the thermophoresis is analyzed. A short summary in Section  5 concludes the paper.

                      as proposed by Courant  [23] and later on by Turner et al.  [24] allows for the use of shape functions with local support in each element 
                        e
                      and thus, for a simple approximative representation of complex geometries. Such finite element approximations found numerous applications in various disciplines, although it comes at the cost of reduced continuity across the element boundaries. About a decade ago T. Hughes  [25–27] introduced non-uniform rational B-splines as finite element basis functions with the aim to gain control on continuity requirements in design and to maintain the geometrical exact representation of complex engineering structures. He coined the term Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) which we will continue to use for all NURBS based finite element methods.

Standard refinement strategies subdivide on the existing mesh which is in contradiction to the tensor product structure of B-splines. In contrast, hierarchical refinement schemes superpose additional degrees of freedom on the original basis function. A B-spline basis function defined on the hierarchical level

                         can be replaced by a linear combination of splines on the next level

                        , which denote the position in the parametric domain, i.e., within the tensor product structure, along with the local support of the B-spline provides sufficient information for the assembly. Following the extension for NURBS outlined in (5), we obtain

In order to perform a finite element analysis with local refinement, the previously introduced properties have to be satisfied for the refined basis as well. By applying the proposed subdivision procedure (see also Bornemann and Cirak  [29]) together with the spline selection rule presented by Kraft  [30], the refined basis is linearly independent and forms a partition of unity. Furthermore, since any finite linear combination of

Accounting for local refinements in the physical space, the control meshes as well as associated primal variables (e.g. the actual position for solid mechanical problems, the velocity for fluid mechanical problems, the concentration for diffusion problems and phase-field parameters for the corresponding phase-field problems) need also to be refined.

                         with different local refinements up to the third level is displayed. The red line represents the sum of all shape functions, demonstrating that the partition of unity property is satisfied. The green line with markers at the bottom represents the element distribution in the physical space. Note that the evaluation of the shape functions at each Gauss point has to be implemented carefully. To do so, we calculate the absolute position of each Gauss point in the parametric domain beginning with the finest level.

The semi-discrete system can be viewed as a set of ordinary differential equations, i.e. as a mathematical representation of a process that changes with time. Moreover, we assume that all states of the process in time can be determined uniquely and that the process is smooth and differentiable (in contrast to, e.g., contact mechanics).

To reduce the computational cost an adaptive time step strategy can be applied. A standard rule for selecting the actual step size for the numerical integration of the initial-value ordinary differential equations is given as follows (cf. Gustafsson  [35])

A continuous symmetry of a Hamiltonian system is equipped with an additional structure, which manifests itself in the form of conservation laws, see Gonzalez  [36] for a comprehensive review. Structure preserving integrators maintain the structure in the full discrete setting, see Hairer  [37], i.e., they preserve the Hamiltonian along with a certain class of other first integrals arising from the symmetries. To be specific, we consider algorithms of the form

                         This specific construction is of interest for systems with multiple symmetries. Here, we will apply the concept of a discrete derivative to the phase-field model for brittle fracture in Section  4.2, demonstrating the general superiority of this concept for mechanical multi-field systems.

In this section different physical problems are presented which require for approximation at least

                      continuity. For the first system, a transient Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model, we provide an analytical solution in the one-dimensional case and compare the solution with simulation results obtained with different local refinements. The two-dimensional case will demonstrate the consistency of the chosen approach with local refinements. The second system presented in detail addresses a higher-order phase-field approach to brittle fracture in the fully non-linear regime. In such an application the use of a non-linear finite element method is mandatory due to the arising large deformations and motions. A dynamical benchmark example is presented subsequently. At last, two- and three-dimensional simulations of thermal diffusion in binary polymer blends are addressed. Again, local refinements are applied here to improve accuracy and convergence of the solution.

In order to illustrate the capabilities of the hierarchical refinement concept we evaluate the deviation of the numerical solution related to the reference solution. To be specific, numerical results using a constant time steps size 
                           Δ
                           t
                           =
                           0.005
                         are compared with analytical results at time 
                           t
                           =
                           2
                        . To ensure consistency of the higher order approach, we apply first a uniform global 
                           h
                        -refinement scheme. Then, we refine the region passed by the shock wave within the time interval 
                           I
                           =
                           
                              [

                         level-by-level up to the fourth level, see Fig. 5
                         for details. The obtained results are plotted in Fig. 6
                        ; the displayed error is measured in the

                           h
                        -refinement (see right hand side), the expected second order convergence is obtained. For the hierarchical refinement strategy, we achieved higher rates of convergence, see the left hand side of Fig. 6. The corresponding condition numbers of the stiffness matrix for both refinements are presented in Table 1
                        .

                        . Following the investigations in Gomez and Paris  [6] we apply periodic boundary conditions and a uniform random perturbation between 
                           
                              [

                              0.05
                              ]
                           
                         of the homogeneous field 
                           u
                           =
                           0
                         as initial condition, shown on the left hand side of Fig. 7
                        . Furthermore, we set the first constitutive parameter 
                           ν
                           =
                           1
                        , whereas the settings of the second parameter are 
                           α
                           =
                           0.225
                        , 
                           α
                           =
                           0.210
                         and 
                           α
                           =
                           0.195
                        , respectively, to obtain the three basic states found by Paniconi and Elder  [3]. Here the hexagonal state (
                           α
                           =
                           0.225
                        ) yields a spatially ordered stationary solution, the breathing hexagonal state (
                           α
                           =
                           0.210
                        ) is characterized by a periodic oscillation of hexagonal cells and for the disordered state (
                           α
                           =
                           0.195
                        ) the solution shows a chaotic behavior. The original mesh consists of 128×128 elements. A refined area of 20×20 elements for level 1 is located at the center of the domain to demonstrate the validity of the refinement technique for multivariate problems of higher order, see right hand side of Fig. 7. Finally, we show the numerical solution for the three basic states of the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky problem in Fig. 8
                         for each case to four discrete points in time.


                        
                           Remark
                           We observe for 
                                 α
                                 =
                                 0.225
                               that the time until the system achieved a perfect stationary solution is in general larger compared to the usage of a uniform 128×128 elements mesh. In a series of numerical test we observed that using a finer background mesh yields for both, the refined as well as the unrefined case, nearly identical results.

                         with a horizontal notch as depicted in Fig. 9
                         is considered. All values given in this section refer to the units N, mm, s and combinations thereof. Taking the classical fracture modes I, II and III into account, the three dimensional plate is investigated within an opening, an in-plane shear and an out-of-plane shear displacement driven setting. The constitutive behavior is governed by a hyperelastic compressible Neo-Hookean model with associated strain energy function

The initial meshes are shown in Fig. 10
                         for all applied loads and displacements. The boundary conditions are depicted in Fig. 9. The plate consists of 20×4×20 elements on level 0 and is decomposed using a consistent higher order domain decomposition method, such that a horizontal notch is introduced to the model. Additionally, the finite element mesh is locally refined to capture the different crack path according to the specific fracture mode:

                        ) the early stages of microstructural evolution are driven by spinodal decomposition of phases. Only gradually the periodic forcing asserts itself against the suppression of phase decomposition. Over time the temperature gradient increasingly coins the microstructure. A periodic stripe pattern evolves and destroys the typical coarsening known from standard Cahn–Hilliard systems.

                         The remaining parameters are the same as in the prior example. Since we want to investigate domains where the thickness is small compared to length and width we apply periodic boundary conditions on the left/right and front/rear surfaces. The lower surface is assumed as

                         whereas the upper boundary is set as 
                           ∂

                        . Moreover, we refine the region of the upper boundary as shown on the right hand side of Fig. 19
                        . At the beginning of our simulation we set the laser intensity (66) for nearly 2.5 s to zero to obtain an aged cuboid without the effect of thermal diffusion. A typical coarsening scenario can be seen in the picture 1–3 of Fig. 20
                        . Afterwards, the middle of the upper surface is heated by the laser spot. As seen in the subsequent pictures of Fig. 20, an enrichment of PDMS in the heated region takes place whereas the microstructural evolution in the remaining region is driven by spinodal decomposition of phases. To be more precise the concentration here varies between 0.42 and 0.755.


                        
                           Remark
                           During our computational studies we observed that the temperature field remains nearly constant. This derives from the fact that the mass diffusion time is 103 times slower than the time scale for thermal diffusion. Therefore the temperature can be seen as quasi-constant in the considered periods of time.

                      continuity in one-, two- and three-dimensions are investigated in detail. A hierarchical refinement scheme for higher-order NURBS basis functions is applied to a series of physical problems, demonstrating the consistency and applicability of the proposed numerical framework.

Local refinement strategies using a priori refined areas are shown for three dimensional crack propagation problems in the static and the transient regime as well as for multi-physics diffusion problems. For all systems under consideration, the local refinement enables us to reduce the computational effort drastically, without sacrificing the continuity requirement of the specified problems under investigation.

The flexibility and, more importantly, the consistency of this framework for local refinement within an isogeometric finite element analysis are given by construction. For three-dimensional higher-order phase-field models involving steep gradients, this refinement scheme has proven to be a perfect tool in the IGA environment. In ongoing and future work this hierarchical refinement technique will be employed for spatial adaptivity, e.g. in the context of contact mechanics, brittle fracture and immersed concepts for fluid–structure interaction problems.
