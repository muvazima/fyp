                  This paper introduces a blocking model and closed-form expression of two workers traveling with walk speed m (m
                     =

                     +2,…. We develop a Discrete-Timed Markov Chain (DTMC) model to capture the workers’ changes of walk, pick, and blocked states, and quantify the throughput loss from blocking congestion by deriving a steady state probability in a closed-form expression. We validate the model with a simulation study. Additional simulation comparisons show that the proposed throughput model gives a good approximation of a general-sized system of n stations (i.e., n
                     >2), a practical walk speed system of real number m (i.e., m
                     ⩾1), and a bucket brigade order picking application.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A no-passing circular passage system characterizes three common material handling and traffic flow situations: (1) a warehouse with a narrow-aisle system to improve storage utilization (Gue, Meller, & Skufca, 2006; Hong, Johnson, & Peters, 2012; Hong, Johnson, & Peters, 2013a; Parikh & Meller, 2010); (2) a no-passing bucket brigade order picking to obtain high operational performance and high space utilization (Bartholdi & Eisenstein, 1996; Hong, Johnson, & Peters, 2013b); and (3) a cellular automata model to capture the characteristics of traffic flow (Skufca, 2005). This no-passing passage represents a one-way transit situation with a traffic rule that forbids a worker or vehicle to pass over another worker or vehicle due to physical and logical restrictions. Fundamentally, workers move forward (i.e., one-way) and stop at a service station when a service is requested; any difference in the amount of service requested causes blocking congestion.

Generally speaking, a simple transit protocol, such as a no-passing or one-way passage, reduces or eliminates workers’ directional confusion (Bartholdi & Eisenstein, 1996; Hong et al., 2013b) and enables managers to develop a high-resolution operational algorithm (Hong et al., 2012, 2013b). Unlike a two-way traffic system, a no-passing protocol obtains a larger service area by yielding traffic space for a service. For example, material handling often favors a passage system built on a narrow-aisle because the narrow-aisle automatically creates more storage space (Gue et al., 2006). However, the no-passing protocol’s inevitable blocking congestion will offset most operational advantages.

The literature has studied the significance of blocking congestion from the passing restriction in narrow-aisle picking systems (Gue et al., 2006) and bucket brigade order picking systems (Bartholdi & Eisenstein, 1996). The significance of congestion in circular warehouses is addressed by a k-worker congestion model of infinite walk speed (Skufca, 2005). Gue et al. (2006) recognize that a practical congestion, such as a narrow-aisle picking system, is very sensitive to walk speed. The authors develop analytical models of both infinite and unit walk speeds and assess the impacts on congestion blocking between two extreme walk speeds. Pick patterns also impact blocking congestion. Parikh and Meller (2010) and Hong et al. (2013a) extend into cases of a stochastic pattern of picks. Based on our review of the literature, we assert that a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of walk speed over blocking congestion will derive from simulation and practical experiences rather than limited analytical models. Thus, we propose a DTMC model to coordinate two workers’ travels, service operations, and blocked delays, and find a closed-form expression of blocking throughput in a function of walk speed m, pick density p, and number of service stations n.

This paper contributes to the literature on congestion by providing a DTMC model when two workers travel a circular passage system with stochastic service time and walk speed m and by deriving a closed-form expression of the blocking throughput model. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 clarifies the problem and reviews the related studies. Section 3 introduces the DTMC model and its closed-form expression for the m
                     =2 case and extends the model for m
                     >2 cases. Section 4 discusses the analytical model’s chief characteristics. Section 5 summarizes the comparison results for a general-sized model and a bucket brigade order picking. Section 6 mentions future research.

In this paper a system is a circular-aisle warehouse, a service station is a pick column, a service is a pick, and workers provide a picking service. Fig. 1
                         shows a circular-aisle warehouse with linked n pick columns (n
                        >2) and workers circulating in a clockwise direction. A stochastic model determines the number of picks at a pick column. Workers continue picks with probability p. They spend unit time to conduct one pick. When no pick is chosen (1−
                        p), they move to the next service station with speed m, i.e., the walk time between two pick columns is 1/m. After a pick, each worker repeats the same choice independently of the previous action. At a pick column, workers retrieve items from both sides. The number of picks at a pick column is determined by a series of successes. The retrieval time is one unit time regardless of the sides and shelving height. Blocking occurs under a no-passing restriction, e.g., when two workers are in neighboring pick columns, if the downstream worker is picking, the upstream worker cannot pass and thus remains idle because there is no available pick. When the blocking worker completes pick(s) and a blocking situation is released, each worker moves to his/her next pick column simultaneously.

The ratio of the number of pick columns n to the walk speed m influences the modeling step. Our modeling assumes that (n
                        −2) % m
                        =0, where % is the notation for the modulation operator, but shows the applicability to the general configurations of any positive n
                        >2 and real number m
                        ⩾1. As a performance measure, we obtain the percentage of time blocked (=the time blocked of a worker/the worker’s total time in the system), and denote it as b(p,
                        m,
                        n).

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Fundamentally, the travel distance is the primary source of management in a warehouse. Roodbergen and Vis (2006) address an analytical model in a parallel warehouse to estimate the average travel distance over the number of aisles, the length of each aisle, and the location of depot, i.e., a warehouse’s loading/unloading station. Their analytical model determines the optimal location of depot and the optimal number of aisles. Roodbergen, Sharp, and Vis (2008) evaluate the expected travel distance for order pickers in a warehouse with a layout of two or more cross-aisles. Their study balances the number of blocks of parallel-aisles and the expected operational performance. Both throughput models of travel distance apply when one worker retrieves orders in no-congestion situations.

Clearly, a multiple-worker operation obtains higher operational throughput. However, when multiple workers travel in a limited space, congestion can be an operational concern. The literature has studied three congestion cases: aisle-entrance congestion (Pan & Shih, 2008; Pan, Shih, & Wu, 2012; Pan & Wu, 2012); no-passing congestion (Gue et al., 2006; Hong et al., 2013a; Parikh & Meller, 2010; Skufca, 2005); and pick-column congestion (Hong et al., 2013a; Parikh & Meller, 2009). Pan and Shih (2008) introduce a congestion delay situation which occurs at an aisle entrance of a parallel-aisle warehouse. Due to the technology restriction of Radio-Frequency Identification Detection (RFID), at most one worker stays in an aisle. That is, if one worker enters an aisle, the other workers must remain idle at the aisle’s entrance until the first pick is completed. A tandem network of queueing systems estimates the throughput of workers. Using the same example, Pan and Wu (2012) evaluate congestion and travel distance with several routing policies over different storage assignment policies. The experiments conclude that the balance of workload over each aisle results in less congestion.


                        Skufca (2005) analyzes no-passing congestion in a circular warehouse; his k-worker congestion model assumes infinite walk speed. Gue et al. (2006) recognize that a no-passing circular passage blocking model is applicable to a narrow-aisle order picking system. Their approach considers a two-worker operation and two extreme walk speeds, very fast and very slow. Models of these two extreme situations narrow the scope of the loss by blocking congestion and an extended simulation study validates a normal walk speed situation. Parikh and Meller (2010) and Hong et al. (2013a) undertake a blocking analysis when pick time at a stop is not deterministic. Their analytical models also investigate two-worker operations with very fast and very slow walk speeds.

Congestion can still occur even when passing is available by extending aisle widths. For example, when a picker attempts a pick in a pick-column where another picker is picking, he/she must remain idle until the pick-column becomes unoccupied. Parikh and Meller (2009), who introduce analytical models for this type of delay, pick-column congestion, identify the blocking models and throughput characteristics. Pick-column congestion also can result from significant variations in workload assigned by management, although the impacts are generally less than for no-passing situations. Mowrey and Parikh (2014) introduce a warehouse layout including both no-passing and pick-column congestions, where narrow-aisles and wide-aisles optimize both storage space and operational throughput. Their simulation study estimates congestion delay in the alternate situation of no-passing and pick-column blockings.

According to the literature (Gue et al., 2006; Hong et al., 2013a; Parikh & Meller, 2010; Skufca, 2005), blocking congestion in a no-passing circular passage system is influenced by the number of workers (k), the pick density (i.e., work load, p), the pick:walk time ratio (m:1 or 1:1/m), the variation of pick time at a pick column (deterministic or stochastic pick times), and the size of systems (n pick columns). While our literature review gives some insights into the design and control of material handling systems and traffic flow, we note that most requires additional simulation studies to clarify the relevant observations, specifically over a walk speed. To improve understanding, Hong et al. (2013b) show that in terms of blocking delay, a no-passing circular passage system can represent bucket brigade order picking, which is popular in facility (Hopp & Spearman, 2008) and logistic situations (Bartholdi, Eisenstein, & Lim, 2010). Thus, our paper introduces a blocking model and closed-form expression over a walk speed m in a two-worker circular passage and demonstrates the model’s applicability for a practical bucket brigade order picking.

We begin the DTMC modeling with a special case of m
                     =2 because we want to capture the “reducibility” characteristic that is important in deriving the closed-form expression. Next, we identify a general model for deriving a relevant closed-form expression when m is greater than 2.

We assume that m is 2 and n
                        =an even number. We let D
                        
                           t
                         denote the distance between worker 1 and worker 2 at time t. We express the distance as (n
                        +(worker 1 position)−(worker 2 position)) % n ranging from 1 to n
                        −1. First, we define state S
                        
                           t
                        
                        =0 (block) representing worker 1 blocking worker 2, state S
                        
                           t
                        
                        =
                        n representing worker 2 blocking worker 1, and the states [1,2,…,
                        n
                        −1] given by S
                        
                           t
                        
                        =
                        D
                        
                           t
                        . In other words, there are two blocking states and n
                        −1 distance-related states. We summarize all states by the sequence [0 (blocked),1,2,…,
                        n
                        −1,
                        n (blocked)]. Note that sequence [0,1,2,…,
                        n
                        −1,
                        n] is not a Markov chain. Since the pick time requires two epochs, a worker who picked in the first epoch must keep picking in the second epoch, i.e., D
                        
                           t+1 depends on D
                        
                           t
                         and on the action of the workers in the previous step.

Second, we establish the Markov property by including the history of the previous step in the state. We divide a pick time into 2 sub-states, i.e., epochs. We label states as d
                        
                           xy
                        , where x and y represent the number of epochs remaining until the next decision of workers 1 and 2 is available. For example, state 301 says that workers are three picking points apart, worker 1 has just completed picking or walking and is ready for a new decision, and worker 2 has just started a pick one epoch and continues picking in this epoch. There is only 0 or 1 because the pick:walk time ratio is 2:1. For blocked state (d
                        =0 or n), the blocked worker cannot move. No state is necessary on the blocked worker. Thus, we use d
                        
                           x
                        , and 01 and 00 (or n
                        1 and n
                        0) are possible with the same assumption. In summary, the four eligible sub-states are xy
                        =00, 11, 01, and 10 for distance d. If the situation is blocked, the only two eligible sub-times are x
                        =0 and 1. The possible states follow [00, 01, 100, 101, 110, 111, 200, 201, 210, 211,…,
                        n
                        −100, n
                        −101, n
                        −110, n
                        −111, n
                        0, n
                        1].

Now we define three transition cases. Fig. 2
                         illustrates the transition diagram between the states.

When both workers determine picks (p
                           2), the state goes to d
                           1,1, and after transiting from d
                           1,1, it transits to d
                           00. When both workers decide to walk (q
                           2), the current status repeats. Other cases (pq or qp) change distances and allow a picking worker to repeat a decision. When the current state is 100 or n
                           −100, there is a possibility to go to a blocked state. With a pick (p) and a walk (q), the state goes to a blocked state 01 or n
                           1.

The current state is d
                           01. Worker 1 can pick or walk. If worker 1 picks (p), he/she remains at the location, and worker 2 has no decision. Thus, the state transits to d
                           10. If worker 1 walks (q), the distance increases and both workers become eligible for a decision at the next state. For example, if worker 1 walks, d
                           01 goes to (d
                           +1)00, and both workers are available for picks. It is possible to go to a blocked state when the current state is 110 or n
                           −101. With a walk (q), the state goes to a blocked state 00 or n
                           0.

When the current state is 00 or n
                           0, the blocking worker determines the next state, pick, or walk. If the blocking worker picks (p), the state recursively goes to 01, whereas if the blocking worker walks (q), the state goes to 100 or n
                           −100.

From the state transition diagram (Fig. 2), the resulting transition matrix is:

                           Observing that solution v and the state transition diagram exhibit one important structure, a set of repeated 0s resulting from the reducibility of the DTMC, leads to:
                              Observation 1
                              States [101, 110, 200, 211, 301, 310,…,
                                 n
                                 −200, n
                                 −211, n
                                 −101, n
                                 −110] (the bottom part in the transition diagram) are always zero-expected in steady state because they are transient.


                           Observation 1 facilitates the computational procedure since it removes the number of states considered from the perspective of the steady state observation. Note that the reducible DTMC is a common characteristic of a complex DTMC (Kulkarni, 2010).

Now we denote Communicating class (
                              C
                           ) as the set of states which communicate with each other, including states in blocked states, d
                           =even and xy
                           =01 or 10, and d
                           =odd and xy
                           =00 or 11. States in d
                           =odd and xy
                           =01 or 10 can access any blocked states (00 or n
                           0), whereas a blocked state cannot access any states in d
                           =odd and xy
                           =01 or 10. This situation is the same as states in d
                           =even and xy
                           =00 or 11. Shortly, the states in 
                              S
                           ⧹
                              C
                            cannot be accessible from any state in 
                              C
                           . Thus, the states in 
                              S
                           ⧹
                              C
                            become transient and the probability in steady state is zero-expected. Next, removing the zero-expected states on the diagram and disregarding the removed states from the transition matrix (A) lead to new sub-matrices:

                           v. This result equals the previous v except for removing the 0s. The next section describes the use of this approach to efficiently solve a general model with respect to m.

We establish the Markov property by including the history of the previous step in the state, i.e., defining one epoch as 1/m, which is one unit walk time. In other words, we specify a pick time into m sub-states (epochs). We label states as d
                        
                           xy
                        , where x and y represent the number of epochs remaining until the next decision of workers 1 and 2 is available. For distance d, according to the remaining time to be ready for a decision, we define m
                        *
                        m sub-states as xy
                        =(x
                        =0,…,
                        m
                        −1,
                        y
                        =0,…,
                        m
                        −1) for worker 1 and worker 2, respectively. Typically, d
                        0,m−1 means that worker 1 is ready for a decision and worker 2 still has m
                        −1 epochs. Exceptionally, sub-states for a blocking include x
                        =0,…,
                        m
                        −1. If a blocking incurs, the blocked worker has no decision authority until the blocking worker is released from the current pick, which may range from 1 to m. In other words, releasing a blocked state requires m epochs (x
                        =0,…,
                        m

                           S
                        
                        =[00,…,0

                        n
                        0,…,
                        n
                        
                           m−1]. The number of feasible states is 2m
                        +
                        m
                        2(n
                        −1). If this model appears too complex to obtain any clear transition diagram and a closed-form expression, it is possible to derive a simple diagram since we have already analyzed the steady state probability as shown by the m
                        =2 model.

We identify the blocking class, the communicating class, and the transient class. Any state in blocking communicates with every other state. 0
                           m−1 transits to 0
                           m−2 after one epoch, 0
                           m−3 after two epochs,…,00 after m
                        −2 epochs. 00 can transit to 100 when the blocking (downstream) worker moves ahead one pick column. In 100, the downstream worker’s pick and the upstream worker’s walk lead to 0
                           m−1. Thus, 00 can transit to 0
                           m−1. In summary,

For a blocking, the upstream worker must confront the downstream worker with the distance between two workers=1, and start a walk before the downstream worker completes a pick.

We measure the distance for a blocking by the difference between the cumulative numbers of walks, d

States in

                         are transient, which offers an opportunity to simplify the active states when we analyze the steady state characteristics. In summary,

According to Lemma 1, states in a blocking class (0
                                 y
                              , n

                               for y

                              m
                              −1) are accessible from states in 
                                 T
                              . However, according to Lemma 2, states in 
                                 T
                               cannot be accessible from the blocking state. Thus, they are transient.□

From Lemmas 1–3 we conclude that analyzing 
                           C
                         can offer insights into 
                           S
                         in steady state. To analyze the steady state probability of a synchronized system, only states in 
                           C
                         are necessary because states in 
                           S
                        ⧹
                           C
                        
                        =
                        
                           T
                         are transient. The DTMC is composed of 
                           C
                         and 
                           T
                        . According to Lemmas 2 and 3, 
                           C
                         is the communicating class and others states in 
                           T
                         are transient. Thus, 
                           C
                         becomes irreducible. In steady state, all states in 
                           T
                         become 0. Thus, we can analyze the steady state probability with the transition diagram of 
                           C
                        . Instead of enumerating all states, we apply the observation associated with communicating class 
                           C
                         to analyze our general model. The set size of 
                           C
                         is 2m
                        +
                        m(n
                        −1) compared to the original size=2m
                        +
                        m
                        2(n
                        −1). Fig. 3
                         depicts the transition diagram.

While using matrix 
                           A
                        , we denote a sub-matrix m by m for the sub-states. We assign the first sub-state to d
                        0,− and the last sub-state to d
                        −,0, where ‘−’ becomes 0,…,
                        m
                        −1. We assign the second sub-state to d
                        −,m−2. The third sub-state becomes d
                        −,m−3. The m
                        −2 sub-state is d
                        −,2. The resulting sub-transition matrices are:

In Fig. 4
                        , we compare this plot to a simulation result to obtain the gap between the performances of the simulation model and the analytical model in terms of the difference of time blocked (Diff %=∣the percentage of time blocked by the analytical model – the percentage of time blocked by the simulation model∣/(the percentage of the time blocked by the analytical model)*100). When mof a 22 pick column circular-aisle system=∞, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1, the error gaps on average are 0.14%, 0.16%, 0.17%, 0.19%, 0.28%, and 0.41%, respectively. These results show that the analytical model accurately approximates blocking in a circular-aisle system.

This section conducts a sensitivity analysis over the analytical model combining n, m, and p and summarizes insights into the variations over p or m.

We analyze Eq. (1) in terms of work load (p) and walk speed (m). We derive an upper bound (i.e., maximum blocking case) and a lower bound (i.e., minimum blocking case) of b(p,
                        m,
                        n) with respect to workload (p). This leads to:

                              When m is finite, blocking is maximized in a no-passing passage system as:

We note that when m is finite, the portion of loss by blocking is best, i.e., 0, at p
                        =0. However, the maximal blocking case (p
                        ∗) also is very close to p
                        =0. Because Eq. (1) is concave when m is finite, it establishes a lower bound at p
                        =0 and 1. At p
                        =0, the blocked percentage is:

                        =0 stands for no workload. Therefore, we need to investigate p

                        Corollary 1 implies that when the walk speed is fast enough and since the maximal blocking case is very close to a low pick density, it is better to increase work load (p) for more efficiency. One example is a larger batch size for a fast-walk environment in a warehouse when management is forced to increase the throughput.

It makes sense that a faster walk produces more blocking while other conditions are the same. However, the increase of blocking is not linear over the increase of m. In summary,

                        Theorems 1 and 2 indicate that blocking can increase and decrease by increasing p, whereas blocking always worsens as m increases.

Noting that a practical situation of blocking congestion will vary in terms of the size of a station, a non-integral walk speed, and even a bucket brigade operational situation, we study a general-sized system of n stations (i.e., n
                     >2), a practical walk speed system of m(i.e., m
                     ⩾1), and a bucket brigade order picking application. Our objective is to show how our analytical model explains general and practical situations by comparing the results to other simulations.

One of our modeling assumptions includes the strict relationship between the system size and the walk speed of (n
                        −2) % m
                        =0, e.g., n
                        =22 and m
                        =2, 5, 10, and 20. Practical situations commonly involve choosing m over given n and analyzing the impacts of n over m. Relaxing the system size restriction assumption extends our analytical model’s applicability. Therefore, we quantify the throughput loss by blocking delay in the general-sized configuration where (n
                        −2) % m does not equal 0, e.g., m
                        =2 and n
                        =5,7,9,…. In addition, we conduct a simulation to obtain the blocking throughput loss in a general-sized system for the comparison purpose. When m of a circular-aisle system=2 with pick probability=0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 (Fig. 5
                        (a)), the error gap on average (=∣simulation results−(1)∣/simulation results*100) is 0.59%, 0.02%, and 0.28%, respectively. For a walk speed=20 situation (Fig. 5(b)), the error gap on average is 0.59%, 0.35%, and 0.25%, respectively.


                        Table 1
                         summarizes the results from the various configuration of n. The simulation comparison consistently shows an average error gap of less than 0.5%. As walk speed (m) increases, the average of the error gap in (n
                        −2) % m
                        ≠0 experiences a higher gap error. However, the largest values in the average are within 0.5%. These results show that our analytical model accurately approximates blocking in a circular-aisle system regardless of the system configurations of m and n. Note that according to Gue et al. (2006), a real worker in a narrow-aisle order picking system is not fast and that real pick:walk time ratios range from 5:1 to 20:1. Thus, m in the experiments uses 2–20.

Additional experiments demonstrate that our model also shows a robust result over real-number m. Fig. 6
                         illustrates the throughput loss by blocking over m. We relax the integrality assumption of m and compare Eq. (1) to the simulation results of the same m, i.e., the interval of m
                        =0.2. When p of a circular-aisle system=0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 in a 20 pick column model (Fig. 6(a)), the error gap on average is 0.50%, 0.19%, and 0.03%, respectively. Fig. 6 (b) considers a 100 pick column model which is a general-sized system. When pof a circular-aisle system=0.1, 0.2, and 0.5, the error gap on average is 0.46%, 0.27%, and 0.43%, respectively.

Eq. (1) accurately reflects the continuity of m as well as p. Table 2
                         summarizes the gap comparison over m
                        =integer and m
                        ≠integer cases between the analytical and simulation results. The error gap shows no clear discrepancy. A real-numbered approximation can be very helpful to observe a real operational situation including blocking congestion. We describe an application in the next section.

We validate our model for a bucket brigade order picking in combination with flow-rack shelving with instantaneous backward situation (Fig. 7
                        (a)). This order picking situation is abstracted into a linear shape with one loading station and one unloading station (Fig. 7(b)). Workers travel through one-way aisles to retrieve items from shelves and place them in a bin on a conveyor (see (Bartholdi & Eisenstein, 1996; Hong et al., 2013b) for detail). Blocking congestion arises when the downstream worker with a tote is busy retrieving items, whereas the upstream worker plans to retrieve items over downstream worker’s current pick column. Since the downstream worker’s tote is not complete, the downstream worker cannot take over a new tote from the upstream worker. Thus, the upstream worker idles until the next pick column is available.

We assume that hand-off delay is not instantaneous and that backward walk speed (empty travel walk speed) is instantaneous. m

                        h
                        =the expected hand-off time per trip). Given these assumptions, we obtain the time blocked probability in the n pick columns bucket-brigade=

As mentioned, similar to a bucket brigade order picking situation, the analysis of blocking congestion can vary over a small change of walk speed, pick probability, and system size. The proposed analytical model produces fine-grained results over the variance of walks speed and system size.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper introduced a two-worker blocking model with stochastic service time and walk speed m in a no-passing n-pick column passage system (n
                     =
                     m
                     +2,2m
                     +2,…). Blocking congestion was correlated by walk speed (m
                     =1,2,…), work load (p), and number of service stations (n). We identified a DTMC model and closed-form expression of the blocking congestion. To facilitate the step for a closed-form expression, we proved that the DTMC model includes reducibility. A comparison study showed that our analytical blocking congestion model is applicable for a bucket-brigade order picking situation as well as a general walk speed no-passing circular passage system.

In the future, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of material handling, logistic, and traffic flows based on our analysis of representation over the walk speed and work load in analytical and practical situations. We plan to refine our model for k-worker situations and explore applications. The expression of blocking congestion over k workers and walk speed m, pick density p, and system size n is another important dimensional extension.
