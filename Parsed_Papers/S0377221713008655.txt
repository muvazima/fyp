                  This paper deals with the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Draft Limits (TSPDL), which is a variant of the well-known TSP in the context of maritime transportation. In this recently proposed problem, draft limits are imposed due to restrictions on the port infrastructures. Exact algorithms based on three mathematical formulations are proposed and their performance compared through extensive computational experiments. Optimal solutions are reported for open instances of benchmark problems available in the literature.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Draft Limits (TSPDL) is a variant of the well-known TSP, recently introduced by Rakke, Christiansen, Fagerholt, and Laporte (2012), that arises in the context of maritime transportation. The sequence of ports that a cargo ship visits in a tour is dependent on the port infrastructures: the sea-level in a port is sometimes not sufficiently deep to accommodate loaded cargo ships. The port is thus associated to a draft limit, i.e., the maximum vertical distance allowed between the waterline and the bottom of the hull. Note that the draft of a cargo ship depends on the load: the heavier the load, the higher the ship’s draft. Therefore, draft limits can be easily translated into restrictions on the maximum load of the ship.

The problem can be formalized as follows: A directed graph 
                        
                           G

                           )
                        
                      is given, where

                     , or the hull of the ship could be grounded. Therefore the TSPDL asks for the minimum cost Hamiltonian tour, visiting each port exactly once and not violating draft limit constraints.

Despite its simple definition, the TSPDL proves hard to solve to optimality. In fact, the problem is 
                        
                           NP
                        
                     -Hard since it includes the TSP as special case when the drafts are sufficiently large.

                     . The resulting formulation is compact, but provides poor quality bounds. The second formulation includes two additional sets of variables:

                      and

                      in the circuit, respectively. These two sets of variables allow for the introduction in the model of the Miller, Tucker, and Zemlin (MTZ) constraints (Miller, Tucker, & Zemlin, 1960). The MTZ constraints, usually employed to avoid subtours, are used to strengthen the formulation and they are included at the root node of the branch-and-bound tree.

Both formulations have been further strengthened by dynamically separating subtour elimination constraints (Dantzig, Fulkerson, & Johnson, 1954), as well as their lifted counterpart (Balas & Fischetti, 2004). Moreover, lower bounds on the

                                 j
                              
                           
                        
                      variables and lower bounds on the sum of

                      variables are imposed.

The branch-and-cut algorithms originating from both formulations are capable of solving quite effectively instances with a limited amount of ports with draft limits, but when the percentage of ports with a draft limit increases, the algorithm struggles even for medium-sized instances. The problem seems therefore challenging and, as far as we are aware, no other attempts have been made to solve it exactly. This motivated our interest in the problem and we decided to investigate alternative formulations and solution techniques.

Three alternative mathematical formulations are introduced (see Section 2). The first formulation is based on two-index variables, the second formulation is based on three-index variables, whereas the third can be viewed as an improvement over a Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition of the second, including the concept of ng-paths (Baldacci, Mingozzi, & Roberti, 2011), and it is solved through a branch-cut-and-price algorithm.

In Section 3, a description of the branch-and-cut and branch-cut-and-price implementations are presented. The results of our computational experience are summarized in Section 4, while Section 5 presents conclusions and future possible research directions.

The exact algorithms proposed in this work are based on three integer programming formulations that are described in this section.

The first formulation, denoted F1, is based on two sets of two-indexed binary variables. The

                        The Objective Function (1) aims at minimizing routing costs. Constraints (2) and (3) are the degree constraints. Constraints (4) impose that the ship visits at most a port for each intermediate load value. Constraints (4) are not necessary to define an optimal integer solution, because Constraints (2), (3), (6) and (7) guarantee that the ship performs a Hamiltonian tour in which the load is monotonically decreasing. Preliminary experiments showed that these constraints strengthen the linear relaxation and we included them in the formulation. Constraints (5) state that each port has to be assigned to a load. The first and last position of the tour are imposed to be connected to the initial port 0 (Constraints (6) and (7), respectively).

                        . These constraints generalize similar constrains encountered in single-machine scheduling problems (an interested reader can refer to the models based on assignment and positional date variables in Keha, Khowala, & Fowler, 2009). Finally, Constraints (9) and (10) define the binary nature of the variables. Note that Constraints (5)–(8) ensure that the flow is monotonically decreasing along the tour and therefore subtours are avoided.

Formulation F1 presents similarities with the MTZ-based formulation for the Asymmetric TSP (ATSP) (see Roberti & Toth, 2012 for a recent overview and comparison of ATSP models), but consists only of binary variables.

F1 is strengthened by incorporating the trivial constraints

                        The Objective Function (13) minimizes routing costs. Constraints (14) are the degree constraints. Constraints (15) preserve the load conservation. Constraints (16) and (17) force the ship to return to the depot empty and leave the depot carrying Q units, respectively. Constraints (18) define the nature of the variables. Formulation F2 is similar to the three-index formulations proposed in Fox, Gavish, and Graves (1980), for the Time Dependent TSP.

                        as proposed in Abeledo, Fukasawa, Pessoa, and Uchoa (2013). These constraints have been added to F2 in a cutting-plane fashion, using an exact enumerative separation procedure. Note that the constraints can be avoided for the arcs incident in the depot, because Constraints (16) and (17) ensure that no arcs return to the depot after visiting the first port and no arcs would visit a port after the depot.

F3 originates from an alternative interpretation of the solution space of F2, in the spirit of Pessoa et al. (2008). The left-side of Fig. 1
                         presents a TSPDL solution and the corresponding non-zero

                                    ij
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                              
                           
                         variables (the draft limits are 3, 3, and 1 for the ports 1, 2, and 3, respectively and each port asks for the delivery of one unit). The right side of the same figure pictures a path interpretation of the same solution. For each port (on the x axis), the loads compatible with the port’s draft limit are depicted with a circle. The y axis reports the load of the ship. The ship tour is depicted as a path, starting from port 0 with load 3 and returning to port 0 with load 0, where each port is visited exactly once.

A useful relaxation of the problem is obtained by removing (14) from F2. In this case, a feasible solution to (15)–(18) is also a tour starting at the port 0 with load Q and ending at the same port with load 0, respecting the draft limits. Nevertheless, such tour does not have to visit all ports, while other ports may be visited more than once. Optimizing this relaxation can be done in

                        . This amounts to a shortest path problem with resource constraints over the original graph G.

Significantly stronger linear relaxations can be obtained by forbidding some paths in P that visit some ports more than once. For example, one could avoid tours with s-cycles (Irnich & Villeneuve, 2006), i.e., returning to a port i before visiting at least s ports other than i.

Instead, we use the following strategy that already proved being more efficient in practice (Baldacci et al., 2011). For each customer

In our implementation, we define a different ng-set

                                    i
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                              
                           
                         for each load k of the ship after visiting each port i. The neighbors of port i with load k are then selected as the T closest ports that can be visited immediately before i without violating the draft limits and still preserving the same computational complexity. This modification strengthens the relaxation since original ng-sets spend part of its memory to store visits to ports that would violate the draft limits. The same pricing algorithm can be used to handle these ng-sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that ng-sets depending on the load are considered.

Formulation F3 is then defined as (23)–(27), where P is defined as the set of ng-paths, plus all inequalities described in Abeledo et al. (2013) translated to the 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    λ
                                 
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                              
                           
                         variables as shown in (26) and (27). F1 and F2 have a number of variables that is pseudo-polynomial in Q and this may undermine the performance of the resulting algorithms when ports have large demands. These formulations are therefore more suitable when the ports’ demands are not very large. The size of formulation F3 does not depend on Q, but the complexity of the column generation subproblem is linearly dependent on Q. Nevertheless, previous studies showed that reasonably large demands can still be handled in practice (Pessoa et al., 2008; Subramanian, Uchoa, Pessoa, & Ochi, 2013). In particular, Pessoa, Uchoa, Poggi, and Rodrigues (2010) solved a multi-machine scheduling problem using an extended formulation. Each job was associated to a processing time up to 100 units and the resulting subproblem would count up to thousands of units of processing time, without compromising the algorithm’s computing time.

The branch-and-cut algorithms for formulations F1 and F2 have been implemented using the Callable Libraries of CPLEX, and, the subtour elimination constraints (12) and (21) have been separated using the CVRPSEP Library (Lysgaard, 2003). The subtour constraints have been separated only up to the seventh level of the branching tree to speed up computation. Moreover, at most 50 subtour cuts have been added per iteration. The 2-cycle inequalities (22) were separated only at the root node. CPLEX strong branching was chosen for branching and all CPLEX cuts have been used for strengthening the formulation.

The branch-cut-and-price algorithm for formulation F3 is an adaptation of the one proposed by Abeledo et al. (2013). We enhance it by replacing the 5-cycle elimination in the pricing problem with the ng-sets described above with 
                        
                           T
                           =
                           12
                        
                     . Preliminary experiments showed that 
                        
                           T
                           =
                           12
                        
                      provides a good compromise: high quality lower bounds are obtained and the computing times remain relatively small. The method starts by only considering Constraints (24) and iteratively adds the remaining inequalities on demand using the separation procedures described by Abeledo et al. (2013).

The instances considered in our extensive computational testing belong to the benchmark set proposed by Rakke et al. (2012). The problems are adaptations of instances from the TSPLIB (namely burma14, ulysees16, ulysses22, fri26, bayg29, gr17, gr21, and gr48), with number of vertices ranging between 14 and 48. In the following, the acronym a_b_c refers to the

                      instance, adapted from the TSPLIB problem a with b% of ports with draft limit smaller than Q.

For each TSP instance, problems with 10%, 25% and 50% of the ports having a draft limit smaller than Q have been generated and each port has unitary demand. More precisely, given each TSP instance and each percentage of ports with drafts smaller than Q, ten instances were proposed. Drafts smaller than Q were randomly generated between 1 and

Our tests were performed on an Intel Core i5 with 3.2gigahertz and 4gigabyte of RAM, running Ubuntu Linux 10.04. A two-hours time limit was imposed and a single thread used throughout the computational experience.

In the following, we compare the root node lower bounds of F1, F2, and F3 (including or not additional constraints). Detailed results can be found in the Appendix (Tables B.3–B.8). For each Instance and each formulation, the percentage deviation of lower bound z with respect to the optimal solution

Both F1 and F2 dramatically improve their performance when subtour elimination constraints are adopted. F1 with Constraints (12) reduces the average optimality gap with respect to F1 by almost 5%, whereas F2 with Constraints (21) by 1.5%. The average gap of formulation F1 is high (10.68%, and 14.65% for the 
                        
                           gr
                           48
                        
                      instances), whereas F2 produces better quality lower bounds (the average gap is 4.53%). F2 is also roughly five times faster than F1. Constraints (22) reduce substantially the optimality gap and roughly double the average computing time.

F3 provides highly competitive bounds: all instances, except some of the 
                        
                           gr
                           48
                        
                      instances, have been solved to optimality at the root node, in less than roughly 30seconds on average. The average computing times are almost doubled with respect to F2 with Constraints (21), but the average overall deviation is much smaller (3% for F2 with subtour constraints and 0.11% for F3).

In terms of optimal solutions achieved, we compare the best bounds provided by Rakke et al. (2012) with those obtained by F1 with (12), F2 with (21) and (22) and F3. The experiments conducted by Rakke et al. (2012) had been performed on a HP dl160 G3 computer with 2×3.0gigahertz Intel E5472 Xeon CPU and 16gigabyte of RAM. The solver used was Xpress-MP 7.2 and the separation routine for the subtour elimination constraints was coded in C++ using the Mosel 3.2.0 callbacks. Finally, the algorithm was executed using parallel processing on the 8 cores available on the machine and for at most 10,000seconds. Our testing has been performed on a more modest computer, using a single core and a 7200seconds time limit, therefore our results are not directly comparable to those of Rakke et al. (2012).

The upper and lower bounds achieved by the best branch-and-cut of Rakke et al. (2012), the branch-and-cuts of F1 with (12) and of F2 with (21) and (22), and the branch-cut-and-price F3 are given in Tables C.9–C.14, as well as the computing times and the number of nodes explored are provided. The bold-faced values are the non-optimal solution values. Note that the implementations of F1 and F2 benefit from the CPLEX cuts, whereas F3 does not make use of these inequalities.

A summary of these results can be found in Table 2
                     , where the number of optimal solutions achieved for each benchmark set is given. Table 2 presents also results for F1 and F2 without considering CPLEX cuts: this allows for a more comprehensive comparison with the results of Rakke et al. (2012), where these cuts are not implemented.

Even if the number of optimal solutions obtained by Rakke et al. (2012) is higher than that of F1, it is interesting to observe that F1 is not dominated. Example of problems in which F1 outperforms Rakke et al. (2012) algorithms with or without CPLEX cuts are available, even if F1 is executed on a slower computer and for a shorter amount of time. F1 performs remarkably better without CPLEX cuts when small instances are considered, but the CPLEX cuts allow for solving to optimality one of the

                      instances. F2 is capable of solving 214 out of the 240 instances in the set, but only 4 of the 
                        
                           gr
                           48
                        
                      instances. CPLEX cuts do not affect the number of optimal solutions obtained by F2. F3 solves to optimality all instances in the set.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we presented three exact algorithms for the TSPDL. The first algorithm is a branch-and-cut and it is based on a compact formulation in which two sets of two-index binary variables and a polynomial number of constraints are employed. This formulation, when strengthened with subtour elimination constraints and trivial constraints is not empirically dominated by the best formulation proposed by Rakke et al. (2012). The second algorithm is also a branch-and-cut, but the underlying formulation considers three index variables. This formulation is proven to dominate the first one, both theoretically and empirically. The third algorithm is a branch-cut-and-price and it is based on a Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition of the second formulation. Columns are generated by dynamically introducing ng-paths to the formulation. The latter algorithm was capable of solving to optimality all the benchmark instances from the literature.

According to Constraints (17), Q units of load are shipped from the origin port and, from Constraints (16), zero units return to the same port. Moreover, Constraints (15) guarantee that the load monotonically decreases in the tour defined by Constraints (14) and (15). Hence, Constraints (4), (6) and (7) are satisfied by F2. In the following we prove that Constraints (8) are satisfied by F2: we first express the constraints in term of

                           Therefore, Constraints (8) are satisfied.

The linear relaxation of F1 allows for disconnected subtours with at least three vertices of lower cost than the corresponding integer connected solution, as the ones depicted in Fig. A.2
                           . Such fractional solutions are not feasible for F2, because Constraints (15) ensure connectivity. Therefore the feasible region of the linear relaxation of F2 is a subset of the feasible region of the linear relaxation of F1. □
