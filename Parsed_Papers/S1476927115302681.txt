                  The standard method of the global quantitative analysis of gene expression at the protein level combines high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) with mass spectrometric identification of protein spots. One of the major concerns with the application of gel-based proteomics is the need for the analytical and biological accuracy of the datasets. We mathematically and empirically simulated the possibility of the technical regulations of gene expression using 2DE. Our developed equation predicted a detectable alteration in the quantity of protein spots in response to a new protein added in, with various amounts. Testing the predictability of the developed equation, we observed that a new protein could form deceptive expression profiles, classified using prevalent tools for the analysis of 2DE results. In spite of the theoretically predicted overall reduction of proteins that resulted from adding the new protein, the empirical data revealed differential amount of proteins when various quantities of the new protein were added to the protein sample. The present work emphasize that employment of 2DE would not be a reliable approach for biological samples with extensive proteome alterations such as the developmental and differentiation stages of cells without depletion of high abundant proteins.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) is a central high-throughput technique in proteomics that has served in many studies for investigating gene expression. This technique sorts proteins extracted from biological samples of interest in two steps, first by isoelectric point and then by molecular weight. The spots displayed on polyacrylamide gels represent the quantification of expressed genes at the protein level. Generally, a reliable extraction and quantification method is employed, depending on the sample. The protein concentration applied to a gel can be varied between several micrograms to one milligram. The first dimension is performed by rehydrated IPG strips in a solution containing the necessary additives and, optionally, the desired protein concentration. In the isoelectric focusing stage, the pH gradient of IPG strips helps the proteins to separate according to their isoelectric point under the electric field strength. In the second dimension, the separation of proteins is performed using SDS-PAGE.

Multiple levels of gene regulation mediate the differentiation of cells during organ morphogenesis. In this way, gel-based proteome analysis has been frequently employed to reach greater overall proteome coverage in uncovering proteomes that are responsible for different developmental stages. Analysis of proteome dynamics, during light-induced development of rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplasts from etioplasts using quantitative 2DE, showed the exclusive identification of 237 etioplast proteins in comparison with 118 proteins which were exclusively identified using the shotgun approach reported by Zychlinski et al. (2005) (Kleffmann et al., 2007). Hence, 2DE analysis was preferred to identify molecular processes that may be involved in the regulation of plastids during the early illumination phase. A study on the proteome expression pattern of maize plastids during photo morphogenesis processes at five time points (0, 2, 4, 12 and 48h) showed that one third of the reproducible spots first appeared after two hours from greening initiation (Lonosky et al., 2004). A dynamic pattern of gene expression can be concluded from the great alteration in 2D gel patterns during different seed developmental stages. Interestingly, around 50% of the most abundant proteins at the final stage of barley seed development appeared, whereas these were not detectable in the first stages (Finnie et al., 2002). Proteome analysis of soybean seeds revealed the protein expression profile to be approximately the same at the first developmental stages while around 60% of the total spots were seed storage proteins that were only detected at the final stage (Hajduch et al., 2005). A superficial judgment about proteome maps obtained from the skin tissue of grapes in three stages of ripening (Deytieux et al., 2007) showed a large increase in quantity of some protein spots at the maturity stage compared with those spots in two other stages.

During protein expression analysis using 2DE, all gels have to experience the same protein amount, which is both the prerequisite and the challenge for proteome analysis. This fact, along with a large increase or decrease in the amount of some proteins during the developmental stages, results in the elimination or presence of some less abundant ones. Here, we have indicated a few examples of studies on developmental phases that investigate proteome analysis by utilizing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis regardless of depleting the high abundant proteins. Although depletion of high abundant protein in human, bovine (Faulkner et al., 2011; Hannan et al., 2009) and plant organs (Kim et al., 2013; Gupta et al., 2015) are investigated in several researches, there are several studies carried out without considering this fact.

In this paper, we constructed a mathematical method which states that the accuracy of 2DE-based proteome analysis needs to be approved through the determination of a certain threshold level. Along with the mathematical method, an experimental one was simulated by adding a reference protein (BSA) as high abundant protein as well, in order to demonstrate the deceptive gene expression.

Rice seeds (O. sativa cv. IR651) were obtained from International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Seeds were germinated in plates at 28°C. Three-days-old seedlings were transplanted into full strength Yoshida solution and grown in growth chamber at 30°C/26°C (day/night), photoperiod 16h, relative humidity 70%, and a photon flux density 250μMm−2
                        S−1. The root of 75 days old plants were harvested for protein analysis.

Total protein was isolated from roots by TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer’s guidelines (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The extracted protein was dissolved in lysis buffer consisted of 8M Urea, 4% CHAPS, 1% DTT, 1% pH 3–10 ampholytes, 35mM Tris base and stored in aliquots at −80°C until further use. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) using BSA as the standard.

Different amounts of bovine serum albumin fraction V (5, 10, 20 and 40μg) were separately added to 80μg of root protein, and then 80μg of the resulting protein solution was subtracted and loaded onto the analytical gels. One of the samples was left without the addition of BSA and nominated as a standard sample.

The gels were scanned using ImageScanner™ III (GE Healthcare Bio Science AB) at a resolution of 600 dots per in. The data were analysed using ImageMaster 2D Platinum 4 software. Protein spots were quantified based on their relative volumes (%vol), computed by the software itself as below, where Vol

                         is the volume of spot ‘s’ in a gel containing ‘n’ spots.

Hierarchical clustering was carried out using Cluster software version 2.11 (http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Clustering of protein expression patterns was performed as described by the software user manual. Input data for pre-processing were the percentage volume of each protein spot at the BSA treatments by percentage volume of the same protein spot at control conditions (no BSA).

The alteration rate of the protein quantity as a result of BSA addition can be modeled using the following equations. In a protein mixture with n different types of proteins with various quantities of

Two-dimensional gel-based proteome analysis is established on the assumption that changes in protein abundance or spot placement is in fact the result of a biological response. We present an equation to judge the quality of the mentioned assumption and evaluate the effect of the generation of new proteins on the other ones. The results from the application of the developed equation 7 on the different amounts of new protein revealed that an increase in the new protein (

The data showed that with the increment of a new protein quantity (

                        ), the percentage volume of the proteins tends to eliminate (wi
                        ) rises in a hyperbolic manner. Based on the equation, the elimination rate is independent from the number of spots visualized on the analytical gels. As seen in Fig. 1
                        , when a new protein occupies half of the total mixture quantity, the elimination of proteins with a percentage volume of 0.02 and below has been expected. With the current hypothesis, a new protein universally influences all protein spots on the gel. On the other hand, the appearance of a new protein in the given protein mass will not constantly decrease the amount of primary proteins. Based on the spot detection threshold, some proteins will disappear and others will be declined to the new amount.

Gel-based proteome analysis assumes that changes in protein spot quantity result from the biological regulation of gene expression. In contrast, a fact beyond our investigation showed the appearance of a single protein, and its quantity is a function of biological and physiochemical vectors with different magnitudes. Along the various loadings of external protein (new protein) to the desired protein complex, the quantity of the proteins of the complex may experience alteration differently. The effect of BSA on root proteomes and the extensive changes in protein quantity on the gel are shown for normal and 40μg BSA treatments in Fig. 2
                        .

Empirical judgment of the final amount of the proteins influenced by increasing quantity of the new protein may confirm the simulations performed using Eq. (7). As expected, along with the increment of BSA protein content, protein alteration was increasingly observed. The protein spots with more than 50% change were categorized in classes of falsely regulated (increment and reduction) and no-change ones (Fig. 3
                        ). As shown in Fig. 3, proteins tend to remain unchanged in less quantities of BSA. Our data showed that only 12% of proteins in 5μg of BSA revealed significant changes in quantity, in comparison with no BSA treatment. In contrast, more than one third of proteins exposed to changes in quantity when 40μg of BSA was added to root proteome. The least alterations were observed between 5 and 10μg BSA treatments. Whereas, the most variance in the amount of increased and decreased proteins was observed in 40μg BSA in comparison with no BSA treatment, as the reduction of protein quantities was the major response to BSA addition.

There are some proteins with increased quantity even in the presence of BSA. Although the overwhelming majority of proteins tend to be decreased in response to BSA treatments, some unrecognized events are likely to result in presentation of protein spots with higher quantity on the gel. However, the major response of root proteins to the presence of BSA is reduction in quantity (Fig. 3). The lately result is in agreement with the presented mathematical equation.

The presented empirical data analysis uncovered a variety of complicated relations between proteins, whereas it was much simpler from a mathematical point of view. It appears that some chemical and physical events are involved in false protein regulation in response to the insertion of a new protein. To verify the differences in protein quantities affected by BSA treatment in empirical data, we grouped false differentially-regulated protein spots. The determination of a number of proteins categorized in different classes of percentage volumes exhibited a BSA effect on the quantitative pattern of the protein population. The protein classes were generated with 0.001 intervals in relative volumes starting from 0 to 0.621, as seen in Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                        . The frequency of protein occurrence in each class was different between BSA treatments.

In the higher amounts of BSA treatments, a considerable class of proteins belongs to the percentage volume 0, showing that up to 35% and 10% of proteins were absent in the presence of 40 and 20μg BSA, respectively. It should be noted that BSA levels created new variant classes in a straggly manner. The greatest number of classes with an individual member belonged to BSA treatment.

To further investigate the statistical significance of the expected and observed differentiations, the false differentially-regulated proteins and their synthetic counterparts (obtained from Eq. (8)) were introduced to the hierarchical clustering method with the basis of a Spearman rank correlation. The method, as introduced by Eisen et al. (1998) has a helpful graphical interface and the most appropriate similarity metrics. The cluster analysis results revealed that the genuine dataset contained numerous and highly complicated expression patterns, while, as expected, the only pattern in the synthetic dataset was reduction in protein quantities (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the array cluster analysis showed the genuine datasets were separated into three individual clusters, while there was no cluster for grouping the same arrays of the synthetic dataset.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

2DE is a universal technique that has opened new insights into molecular analysis of biosystems. Gel-based proteomics have been identified as a reliable procedure with widespread applications in different fields of studies and various research areas from cell differentiation studies (Kleffmann et al., 2007; Lonosky et al., 2004) to disease markers (Harrington et al., 1986; Yi. et al., 2008) and cancer research (Hanash, 2003; Shen et al., 2004).

In this technique, the comparative analysis of protein profiles makes it possible to uncover the genes responsible for any given condition. One of the major concerns is that the validation of response-related genes driven from gel-based proteome analysis may be concluded from proteins’ competition for presentation on the gel. Our data from mathematical analysis showed that the new protein was a significant rival for the others (Fig. 1), and therefore might be capable of explaining the reduction of proteins quantities resulting from the physical force of new protein addition. The empirical data approved a bias from mathematical analysis (Figs. 3 and 4), which might stem from another bias in the homogeneity of protein complexes in urea buffer, leading to greater success in loading the peptide partners (for example, subunits of a polymeric protein) in the sampling steps.

Ideal protein homogeneity conditions are required in urea solution for the same chance of protein presentation on the gel in order to correct the comparative analysis of protein profiles. In principle, proteins are dissolved and denatured in a high concentration of urea (8M) through its displacement with water molecules in the first solvation shell of proteins and its stronger physical and chemical interactions with proteins compared to water (Robinson and Jencks, 1965; Wallqvist et al., 1998; Bennion and Daggett, 2003; Hua et al., 2008).

Although there are many studies that have introduced the mechanisms of protein denaturation by urea and protein–urea interactions, few studies have been concentrated on intra protein interactions in highly concentrated urea (Hua et al., 2008). With the basis of the proportion of increased proteins in different new protein concentrations, we hypothesized that the interacting peptides in the quaternary structure in biological systems tend to retain their affinity to each other, even in high concentrations of urea. According to the hypothesis, it seems that obtaining 100% homogeneity is not possible in the experimental conditions, and thus this may in part explain the difference between our mathematical and empirical results.

Although 2DE is a remarkable technique in proteomics, and is widely applied in a variety of scientific fields, it is proved that without recognition and depletion of high abundant proteins this method would be unable to mirror the reality of gene expression in some research areas. For instance, illustrating the real expression pattern during the development and differentiation stages will severely encounter the limitations of gel-based proteome analysis. On the other hand, the intensive changes in proteome profiles appear to make 2-DE a deceptive tool for gene expression analysis.

The present work suggested two concerns: the limiting force of intensive proteome changes on valid expression analysis, and the incomplete homogeneity of a protein complex in urea buffer, which should be considered for the correct utility of gel-based proteomics.
