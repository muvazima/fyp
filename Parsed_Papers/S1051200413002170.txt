                  This paper studies the detection of Least Significant Bits (LSB) steganography in digital media by using hypothesis testing theory. The main goal is threefold: first, it is aimed to design a test whose statistical properties are known, this especially allows the guaranteeing of a false alarm probability. Second, the quantization of samples is studied throughout this paper. Lastly, the use of a linear parametric model of samples is used to estimate unknown parameters and design a test which can be used when no information on cover medium is available. To this end, the steganalysis problem is cast within the framework of hypothesis testing theory and digital media are considered as quantized signals. In a theoretical context where media parameters are assumed to be known, the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) is presented. Its statistical performances are analytically established; this highlights the impact of quantization on the most powerful steganalyzer. In a practical situation, when image parameters are unknown, a Generalized LRT (GLRT) is proposed based on a local linear parametric model of samples. The use of such model allows us to establish GLRT statistical properties in order to guarantee a prescribed false-alarm probability. Focusing on digital images, it is shown that the well-known WS (Weighted-Stego) is close to the proposed GLRT using a specific model of cover image. Finally, numerical results on natural images show the relevance of theoretical findings.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Information hiding concerns the transmission of a secret message buried in a host digital medium. It has recently received increasing interest driven by the large number of ensuing application such as watermark-based authentication and fingerprint tracing. Unfortunately, potential malicious uses, among which steganography, have also emerged. The “prisoners problem” [43] illustrates a typical scenario of steganography and steganalysis. Alice and Bob, two prisoners, communicate by embedding a secret binary message 
                        M
                      into a cover-object 
                        C
                      to obtain a stego-object 
                        S
                      which is then sent through a public channel. Wendy, the warden, examines all their communications and tries to detect whether an inspected object Z, either a cover-object 
                        C
                      or a stego-object 
                        S
                     , contains a secret message 
                        M
                      without being able to extract 
                        M
                     .

With many tools available in the public domain, steganography is within the reach of anyone, for legitimate or malicious purpose; it is thus of a crucial interest to be able to efficiently detect steganographic content among a (possibly huge) set of media.

Many methods have recently been proposed to detect steganographic content [4,12,37] among which some are very efficient (see results of BOSS contest [2] for example). These methods can be roughly divided into four categories:
                           
                              1.
                              Only a few detectors rely on the hypothesis testing theory [7,9,13,16,32,48]. The performance of these detectors can be expressed analytically which allows the guaranteeing of a prescribed detection-error probability. Unfortunately, these tests lack an accurate cover medium model and therefore exhibit rather poor performances.

Many detectors belong to the class of structural detectors 
                                 [26] which aims at detecting specific modifications of bit replacement using local pixelsʼ correlation. The Regular–Singular (RS) [21] the Sample Pair Analysis (SPA) [14,34] and the triple/quadruple detectors [27] are, for instance, good representatives of this category. These methods usually achieve overall good performances but lack a statistical model of cover media which prevents the analytic calculation of detection performance.

The Weighted-Stego-image (WS) analysis, initially proposed in [20] to estimate the payload size and deeply studied in [28,29], forms a class apart which is known to have good detection performance. Similarly to the structural detectors, the WS detectors rely on a local autoregressive model of media. However, the statistical properties of WS algorithms remain unknown; therefore, probabilities of detection errors can only be measured empirically.

Lastly, universal or blind detectors aims at detecting any steganographic scheme in any kind of image using a set of selected features and supervised learning methods to train a classifier. As in all applications of supervised learning, a difficult problem is to choose an appropriate feature set which, for detection of hidden information, is usually done empirically. Moreover, the problem of measuring classification error probabilities remains open in the framework of statistical learning [41].

However, the application of hypothesis testing theory is not straightforward because of some fundamental difficulties. Firstly, the cover medium is quantized which prevents a direct application of classical hypothesis tests. Secondly, a digital medium exhibits a complex and structured content which acts as nuisance parameters as it has no interest for hidden information detection. Thirdly, no assumption on the size of hidden data (or more precisely on the relative payload) is available to the steganalyst, the tested hypothesis is thus composite.

In the present work the embedding scheme is assumed to belong to the commonly used family of LSB replacement scheme. Actually, as of December 2011, WetStone Technologies Inc. has 836 data hiding software among which 582 (70%) uses LSB replacement [22]. In addition, detection of mostly encountered algorithms is more important than the detection on seldom found ones. Thus, requirement of efficient and robust detection methods for the LSB replacement steganographic scheme is still a live research topic.

The first step in the application of hypothesis testing theory for steganalysis has been done in [13] in 2004 using a simplistic model of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. This methodology was latter proposed in [8,9] in 2011 to design an efficient test using a complex model of cover medium. During the same year, a theoretical approach was also used in [10,50] to design locally most powerful test (around a given hidden message length) which is difficult to apply in practice.

The fundamental originalities of the proposed article are that the content of cover medium as well as the impact of quantization are considered. In fact, it is necessary to take into account these two phenomena to apply hypothesis testing theory and to precisely establish the performance of proposed statistical tests.

To highlight the contributions of the presented methodology, let us first denote that the detection performance of steganalyzers is usually measured using a fixed hidden data length with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve [15]. However, it is known that in practice, detection results do not only depend on relative payload or embedding rate. For instance, it has been shown that results depend on inspected medium content [5] and hidden data length [38]; the phenomena referred to as “camera mismatch” were also observed during BOSS contest [2]. Likewise, the detection performance of proposed detectors is not compared with an optimal bound or with the most powerful test.

In fact, the relation between cover medium properties and detection performance remains unclear for most of steganalyzers and optimal detection performance has only been established under the dubious condition of neglected quantization.

On the opposite, this paper proposes a novel methodology to detect information hidden in the LSB of a digital medium using hypothesis testing theory. The main contribution is threefold:
                           
                              1.
                              Throughout this paper, the quantization of pixels is thoroughly studied in order to measure its impact on hidden information detection. It is especially shown that data quantization and hidden information in the LSB plane heavily impact on the test performance.

In the ideal context when medium content is known, the statistical performance of the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) is then analytically established. This result provides an optimal upper-bound on the power function one can expect from any detector. Moreover, it is shown that detection performance depends on an “Insertion-to-Noise Ratio” (INR) which allows us to understand how some of cover medium properties impact the performance of the LRT.

Finally, when the structured content of inspected medium is unknown—that is the expectation and the variance of each sample—this nuisance parameter is explicitly taken into account using a linear parametric model. Based on this model of cover content, a sub-optimal Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) is proposed and its statistical properties are analytically given to guarantee, in practice, a prescribed false-alarm constraint.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formally states the problem of steganalysis paying a careful attention to further difficulties. Then, Section 3 details the design of the LRT and the calculation of its performances in the ideal case when the cover medium parameters are assumed to be known. The more realistic case non-i.i.d. samples is studied in Section 4. Section 5 investigates the practical case when no information about cover medium is available. First, the linear parametric model used to estimated unknown parameters of inspected medium is presented. Then, the design of the GLRT is detailed together with the calculation of its statistical properties. Numerical results and comparisons with prior art steganography detectors are presented in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

                     , let the payload 
                        0

                        For clarity, the relative payload or embedding rate R is not distinguished from the actual change-rate in the present paper. However, those two notions are different for steganographic scheme which does not embed one bit per change, using error correcting codes for instance [36].

The LSB replacement method consists in inserting message bits 
                        M
                      by substituting samplesʼ LSB. This embedding scheme can be modeled statistically thanks to the two following assumptions commonly used in steganalysis [13,21]:
                        
                           A-1
                           Because the message is previously compressed and/or cyphered, each hidden bits of message 
                                 M
                               (0 or 1) is drawn from a binomial distribution 
                                 B

                              .

The insertion locations in the cover-object are chosen pseudo-randomly using a secret key, hence, each cover pixel

                               is used with the same probability (referred as “mutually independent embedding” in [18]).

The hypothesis testing problem as formulated in (7) highlights three major difficulties of the hidden information detection problem. First, when data are quantized most of the usual results from decision theory are no longer valid. Second, because the relative payload R is unknown the hypothesis

                      is composite. Last, the mean vector 
                        θ
                     , representing the structured content of inspected digital medium, acts as a nuisance parameter for which an accurate estimation is an open problem of signal and image processing.

The problems of dealing with quantized observations and composite hypotheses are addressed in Sections 3–4 while the problem of dealing with the nuisance parameter 
                        θ
                      is addressed in Section 5.

It should be noted that the application of Lindebergʼs CLT (19) requires that Lindebergʼs condition is satisfied [33, Eq. (11.11)]. In the present case this condition is easy to verify by using Lyapounovʼs condition [33, Eq. (11.12)] which implies Lindebergʼs condition.

                        (18) is Asymptotically UMP (AUMP) using the dubious assumption that the quantization step Δ tends to zero, and thus becomes negligible. Taking into account the impact of quantization, a Locally AUMP (LAUMP) test, i.e. a most powerful around a given payload

Because the design of a UMP or an AUMP test for LSB replacement steganalysis seems out of reach, in realistic conditions, it is proposed in the present paper to use the test

                     (40) are twofold. First, the decision threshold given by (41) does not depend on any medium parameters but only on the prescribed false-alarm probability 
                        
                           
                              α

                     ; hence for any analyzed medium, it is straightforward to guarantee a prescribed false-alarm probability. Second, the power function given in Eq. (42) provides a simple expression and an accurate approximation of power function of the most powerful test. The power function as given in (42) can thus be used as an optimal bound for any steganalyzer which aims at detecting LSB replacement.

Finally, it can be noted that when the quantization step is small compared to the noise standard deviation, i.e. 
                        Δ
                        ≪

                        Remark 2
                        As discussed in the beginning of Section 3.1, the noise variance varies from sample to sample. This property of noise non-stationarity, or heteroscedasticity, especially studied for digital images in [19,24], helps the steganalyzers because, as shown in Appendix A, one can note that:

                            In other words, Eq. (43) shows that for a given mean variance of pixels (or mean noise level), the INR (39) 
                           ϱ is minimal when all the samples have the same variance. It is obvious that the power function as given in Eq. (42) is an increasing function of ϱ. Therefore, for any medium for which the noise heteroscedastic property holds the power function of LRT 
                              
                                 δ
                                 ˜
                              
                            
                           (40) is higher than for a medium with the same mean variance whose samples all have the same variance.

It should be noted that this result only holds true under assumptions A-1 and A-2. For a steganographic scheme which embeds hidden bits only in selected samples, this result not necessarily holds.

In a practical situation, the steganalyst usually has no information on the analyzed medium. From a statistical point of view, the problem is then to use quantized observations to test two composite hypotheses in presence of an unknown nuisance parameter 
                        θ
                     . Obviously, the hypothesis testing theory does not provide a general methodology for finding an optimal test for such problems.

It is necessary to estimate the parameter 
                        
                           
                              θ
                           
                           
                              n
                           
                        
                      for each pixel. However, an estimation of each parameter 
                        
                           
                              θ
                           
                           
                              n
                           
                        
                      is impossible and hence, the “theoretical” decision problem (7) cannot be solved.

To overcome the previously discussed difficulty of dealing with nuisance parameter, the main idea is to group the samples into small sets. This allows us to exploit the redundancies that naturally exist between neighboring samples to estimate locally their expectation.

Hence, it is proposed to divide the medium Z into a set of K statistically independent (non-overlapping) “blocks” of 
                           L

                         Problem (45) is strictly equivalent to problem (7) when 
                           θ
                         is known. When 
                           θ
                         is unknown, exploiting the redundancies between the pixels of the same block is necessary to limit the number of unknown parameters with respect to the number of samples.

The issue is then to model accurately the local redundancies that exist between neighboring samples to allow an efficient estimation of 
                           
                              
                                 θ

                        . While some accurate and efficient models of the content of natural images have already been proposed for steganalysis, see [9,8], this problem lies outside the scope of the present paper which aims at applying statistical decision theory for steganalysis. Hence, among the wide range of possible local model, see [1,23], in this paper the mean vector

The choice of the matrix H is fundamental for such a parametric model. The problem of designing a good parametric model for local signal approximation is out of the scope of this paper, some discussion can be found in [1,23,35]. In this paper, it is assumed that as long as block size remains rather small, they can efficiently, be modeled by algebraic polynomial, see details in Section 6.1; similarly, due to the small block size, the noise variance is assumed constant over each block:

It follows from the parametric model (46) that the maximum likelihood estimators of parameters

                        ʼs explicitly occur in the decision function of the LR test even though have no interest for hidden information detection. The theoretical aspect of dealing with nuisance parameters for testing statistical hypothesis is discussed in [33, chap. 6]. An efficient and well-known approach consists of using the statistical theory of invariance. Application of optimal invariant tests for image processing has already been studied in [17,40].

Let us note that the decision problem described in (45) remains “almost” invariant under the group of translation

                        [10]; the word “almost” is here due to the quantization without which the invariance would be exact. Hence, it is proposed to use this invariance property to design a test close to the generalized LR test (GLRT) by using the “simplified” LR

                        (58), shows that the loss of power of the latter is due to two phenomena. As illustrated in Fig. 4
                        b, the main loss of optimality is due to the use of the parametric model (46) which reduces the number of “free parameter” from 
                           N
                           ≈
                           K
                           L
                         to 
                           K
                           (
                           L
                           −
                           p
                           )
                        .

On the one hand, when p is small the loss of power due to the estimation of sample expectation is small as well. Unfortunately, the assumption that multimedia signals can be represented exactly by a sparse linear parametric model hardly holds true in practice. On the other hand, using a less sparse model with a larger p insure a rather accurate representation of multimedia signals. However, this implies a greater loss of power due the loss of more “free parameters”.

This point highlights a general problem of all steganalysis methods which use an estimation or a “calibration” process to estimate cover content: a compromise has to be found between a sparse representation (to keep p small) and a good approximation (to avoid error in the estimation of the expectation 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    θ
                                    ˆ
                                 
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                           
                        ).

Note that to emphasize the two different factors of loss of power, the GLRT was performed without the noise estimation (so that the only loss of power is due to content estimation). The results obtained with this theoretical GLR are shown by light green lines in Figs. 4a and 4b.

In addition it can be noted that the relative payload R impacts the power function of the proposed GLRT in two different manners. On the one hand, Eq. (55) shows that the variance of the GLR tends to decrease as the embedding increases. This phenomenon has a positive effect on the detection performance because a lower variance of the GLR under the hypothesis 
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                         increases the power function. On the other hand, the definition of 
                           
                              ϱ
                              ˆ
                           
                         
                        (52) shows that the mathematical expectation of the GLR does not linearly depend on R. In fact, the estimated mean variance of pixels increases with the payload R. Therefore, the expectation of the GLR increases fewer when the parameters 
                           
                              
                                 σ
                              
                              
                                 k

                         have to be estimated which causes a loss of power compared to the LRT.

These two phenomena are shown in Figs. 4a and 4b. Fig. 4a presents a comparison between the distribution of the LR 
                           ln
                           (
                           Λ
                           )
                         and the distribution of the GLR 
                           ln
                           (
                           
                              Λ
                              ˆ
                           
                           )
                        . Similarly, Fig. 4b shows a comparison between LRT and GLRT power function as a function of false alarm 
                           β
                           (
                           
                              
                                 α

                         (namely, the Receiver Operating Characteristic—ROC—curves). The results presented in Fig. 4b were obtained using 400 blocks of 32 samples which satisfy the polynomial model detailed in Section 6.1. The additive noise follows a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with

In comparison with the WS detector, this paper proposes two major novelties. First, the test is derived from the statistical theory of hypothesis testing (see Section 3). Hence, the weights

                         are theoretically established and not heuristically chosen. Besides, the proposed methodology allows us to calculate analytically the statistical properties of proposed tests and proposed estimators. The same methodology can potentially be applied to a wider range of embedding scheme (a first step has been done in the use of proposed statistical methodology for LSB matching detection in [6,7,11]).

It is thus expected that the proposed test has a higher detection performance than the WS and, more important, allows the decision to be taken independently of the expectation of samples considered as a nuisance parameter.

Following the arguments given in [1,10,25,42], it was chosen to represent the expectation of samples—i.e. the two-dimensional structured image content—by modeling the expectation 
                           θ
                         with a piecewise two-dimensional (2D) polynomial of order p. This model is applied by extracting non-overlapping blocks of

                        b presents results obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation with 105 realizations of proposed tests using the rather complex natural image shown in Fig. 5a. To model this image, an algebraic 2D-polynomial of order

                         was added to the original image before each simulation; this corresponds to a typical case when quantization step is rather small compared to noise variance. Fig. 5b shows the empirical power function, numerically obtained, as a function of the number of pixel and for some values of prescribed false-alarm probability. The results shown in Fig. 5b emphasize one of the main advantage of the proposed test, the empirically obtained power function is very close the theoretical expected value given by (42) and (58).

Though this paper focuses on digital images, the proposed methodology can potentially be applied to detect information hidden in any kind of digital media as long as a linear parametric model can represent accurately the expectation of each sample—that is the cover medium content. To enlarge the application of the proposed GLR test, Fig. 6
                         presents the results obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation using an uncompressed WAV sound (a Doppler-record of in-utero baby heartbeat). Because the sound is a one-dimensional signal, a 1D-polynomial was used instead of the 2D-polynomial model (62) (see [9,8,50] for details on this model). Due to the rather simple content of such a sound, the size of blocks was set to 
                           L

                         was added to explore a case in which quantization impact is far from being negligible. In fact, Figs. 5b and 6 together emphasize the accuracy of the established power function when quantization step is negligible (when

Similarly, Fig. 6b shows the power function of proposed GLRT as a function of samples number and for different payloads R. These results highlight that the power function of proposed GLR test is very close to the theoretically established power, given in Theorem 4. Fig. 6 also shows that the loss of power due to quantization, precisely given by factor

To highlight the relevance of theoretical findings in practice, it was chosen to verify numerically that the proposed detection scheme allows the guaranteeing of a prescribed false-alarm probability. For a large scale verification of these results, it is proposed to use RAW images from BOSS contest database [2]. These images were converted in grayscale 16-bits color depth images using the software DCRAW (with command dcraw -j -v -D -4). Finally, non-overlapping images of 
                           512
                           ×
                           512
                         pixels were extracted from each (non-processed) color channel; this allows us to inspect images which all have the same size, and also allows us to increase the number of tested images. Note that it has been chosen to use RAW images (which are not processed at all after acquisition, see [39] for details) because the proposed Gaussian noise model (11) is especially accurate for such images; on the opposite the post-acquisition operations, such as demosaicing, white balancing, gamma correction and JPEG compression, can heavily change the distribution of pixels [46].

                         and the theoretical false-alarm probability, calculated from Eq. (53). These results were obtained using the 2D-polynomial model of pixels expectations (62) with order 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         and block width 
                           L
                           =
                           4
                         and 
                           L
                           =
                           5
                         pixels. However, it should be highlighted that some phenomena were omitted from proposed model (for instance quantizer saturation and hot/dead pixels). Therefore, Fig. 7 presents two different results for each block width 
                           L
                           =

                           L

                           5
                         pixels; one obtained by taking into account every pixels, and one by only taking into account the blocks for which the proposed model of both Gaussian noise (11) and 2D-polynomial model (62) holds. The selection of these blocks was made by adapting methodology proposed in [42] to identify blocks which can accurately be modeled by a 2D-polynomial model (62).

It can be noted from Fig. 7 that the false-alarm probability of proposed GLRT 
                           
                              δ

                        (49) slightly differs from theoretical results for high detection threshold (typical corresponding to theoretical false-alarm probability of

                                 10
                              
                              
                                 −

                        ). This phenomenon can be explained by the use of the CLT which does not permit us to get very accurate tail distribution of the GLR. Note also that some “outliers” pixels, typically dead and hot pixels, are excluded from this result because they do not follow the proposed Gaussian model.

For comparing the performance of proposed GLRT, there is a wide range of steganalyzers that potentially could be used.

It was chosen to use one of the leading competitors from structural detectors due to their known rather good performance. By using the Regular–Singular detector (RS) [21], the Sample Pair Analysis (SPA) [14] and the SPA Least Square Method (SPA-LSM) [34], it was empirically observed that the RS (with original mask, see [21]) and the SPA-LSM [34] obtained the best performance. Therefore these two steganalyzers were used for comparisons.

It was also tried to use detectors based on decision theory such as the LRT based on i.i.d. pixels distributions [13], the 
                           
                              
                                 χ
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                         attack [48] or a recent improvement of this detector, namely the Generalised Category Attack (GCA) [32], and the AUMP test proposed in [8,9,16]. Only this last AUMP test exhibits a good detection performance during our experimentation. Hence, only the results of the AUMP test are presented in Fig. 10.

Finally, as shown in Section 5.3, the expression of proposed GLR is very similar to Weighted-Stego steganalysis (WS) [20]. In addition the WS steganalysis is known to be one of the most efficient steganalyzers dedicated to LSB replacement. Therefore, the improved WS detector proposed in [29] is included in numerical comparisons.

                           3
                           The Matlab source code of RS, AUMP and WS steganalyzers can be downloaded from the website of the DDE (Digital Data Embedding) Laboratory: http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/.
                        
                     

Note that it was chosen not to include blind steganalyzers in comparisons. In fact, the main goal of the present article is to design a test with analytically established properties, in order to guarantee a prescribed false-alarm probability, which seems currently out of reach of any supervised learning based steganalysis method.

It should also be noted that the use of the estimated variance of pixels in the proposed GLRT is difficult; in fact for most images a very small number of pixels have an estimated variance equals to zero, typically in overexposed areas. Hence, it is proposed to insure that each block has a minimal variance of

                           =
                           0.1
                        . The blocks for which estimated variance verify 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    σ
                                    ˆ

                         were normalized to set their variance to the acceptable minimum. This empirical rule is similar to the weighting coefficients proposed for WS steganalysis in [20,29], see also Eq. (61), which have been shown to increase the empirical power function.

                           =
                           2
                         and two different block width of 
                           L
                           =
                           4
                         and 
                           L
                           =
                           5
                         pixels. Though a more accurate model of image content might be used instead of the 2D-polynomial (62), the results shown in Fig. 8 clearly shows that proposed GLRT performs much better than the state-of-the-art competitors. Note that Fig. 8 also shows the theoretical power function of proposed GLRT obtained from Eq. (58) using blocks variance estimation (47) obtained with block width 
                           L
                           =
                           4
                        . It can be observed that the power function of the proposed GLRT is very close to the theoretically established power; the small loss of power can be explained by the block variance threshold and by the use of all pixels blocks while, as previously discussed, the Gaussian model might be not very accurate for all of them.

Let us recall that the use of RAW images from BOSS database permits us to obtain results for the case when quantization is rather negligible compared to the noise variance, 
                           
                              
                                 σ
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                           ≫
                           Δ
                        . Hence, to complete the numerical provided in Figs. 10 and 8 numerical results on 8 bit images are provided in Fig. 9
                        . Once again, in Fig. 9, the performance of the different detectors is compared through ROC curves and the same two implementations of the proposed GLR test, with 
                           L
                           =
                           4
                         and 
                           L
                           =
                           5
                        , are used. Note that for the case of 8 bit images, a smaller relative payload of 
                           R
                           =
                           0.01
                         because, even though the quantization has a larger impact, the detection is easier when the ratio 
                           Δ
                           /
                           σ
                         increases. Finally, it can be noted from Fig. 9 that the proposed GLR test performs better than its competitors. More interestingly, it can also be noted that the AUMP test is outperformed by the WS detector. This is not surprising because the AUMP detector has been designed for the case when 
                           Δ
                           /
                           σ
                         tends to 0 which not holds true for 8 bits images.


                        Figs. 10
                        a and 10b present a numerical comparison of the power function of the chosen detectors; those results are obtained using the same RAW images from BOSS contest database [2]. Again, these images are converted in grayscale 16-bits color depth images and all crop to size 
                           512
                           ×
                           512
                         pixels. Results shown in Fig. 10a are obtained with a relative payload 
                           R
                           =
                           0.05
                        ; this allows us to show that the proposed GLRT still performs much better than its competitors for higher payloads R. Note that, due to their low detection performance and for a better readability, it has been chosen to remove the RS and SPA-LSM detectors from Figs. 10a and 10b.

Similarly, Fig. 10b shows the power function of the same steganalyzers for relative payload 
                           R
                           =
                           0.10
                        . The use of a log–log scale allows us to show that for very small false-alarm probability, the WS (with our without bias correction) performs much worse that the other detectors. On the opposite, the AUMP test performs rather well for small false-alarm probability but still has a much lower power function than the proposed GLRT. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that AUMP test is based on a rather simplistic 1D model of natural image content which is not very accurate for large segment size (while the author of [16] suggest a segment size of 16 pixels). In fact, even though the AUMP detector is relevant for 16 bits images, the error of modeling caused by such a naive model largely impacts this detector for a small set of images.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper is a first step made to apply hypothesis testing theory for the detection of hidden information. The problem of detecting hidden information in the LSB of quantized samples is formally stated and studied with the three following goals. First, taking carefully into account quantization impact, the most powerful LR test is designed in the ideal settings of known samples distributions. The statistical properties of this test are analytically established. This test serves as an upper bound for the power function one can expect from any detector and highlights the significant impact that the quantization of samples might have. Second, the content of inspected medium is explicitly considered as a nuisance parameter modeled by a piecewise linear parametric model. Finally, in a practical context of hidden data detection, it is very important to provide the proposed test with a guaranteed false-alarm probability. Hence, thanks to the precise study of quantization impact and to the linear parametric image model, the statistical properties of the proposed GLR test are asymptotically established. This allows the guaranteeing of a false-alarm probability and to show that the loss of optimality, compare to the optimal LRT, is small.

Focusing on digital images, it is shown that the proposed test is close to the well-known Weighted-Stego (WS) detector. Numerical results on a large image database show the relevance of the presented approach to guarantee a false-alarm probability and to detect hidden data with a higher power function than state-of-the-art steganalyzers.

A possible future work, which is out of the scope of this paper, is the exploitation of a more accurate image model. Natural images are usually preferred media for information hiding and the use of a specific model which takes into account properties of images is expected to increase the performance of the proposed test. Similarly, the proposed methodology, based on hypothesis theory, could be applied to detect other information hiding schemes by designing tests with known statistical properties.

For readability, it is proposed to sketch a proof of Remark 2 first; the next appendices are devoted to the study of LR and GLR statistical study and demonstration of proposed theorems.

In Remark 2 it is stated that the heteroscedastic properties helps the steganalyzer in the sense that for a given payload R, and for a given quantization step Δ, the INR ϱ 
                     (39) is minimal when all the samples have the same variance (43):

The main goal of this appendix is to provide a demonstration of Proposition 1 and Theorems 3 and 4. These proof are divided in three steps. First, Appendix B provides a detailed calculation of the moments 
                        ln
                        (
                        
                           
                              Λ
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                        (
                        
                           
                              z
                           
                           
                              n
                           
                        
                        )
                        )
                     . Then, Appendix C provides a demonstration of Proposition 1. Eventually, the demonstrations of Theorems 3 and 4 are detailed in Appendix C.2.

The proof of Theorems 3 and 4 is divided in three steps. First, Appendix C.1 proves the results from Proposition 1. Then Appendix C.2 establishes the asymptotic distribution of LR 
                        ln
                        (
                        
                           Λ
                           ˜
                        
                        (
                        Z
                        )
                        )
                     . Finally the demonstration of Theorems 3 and 4 is given in Appendix C.3.

                         which ends the demonstration of Theorem 4.

The demonstration of Theorem 5 and 6 is divided in two steps. First, Appendix D.1 studies the properties of ML estimations 
                        
                           
                              
                                 θ
                                 ˆ
                              
                           
                           
                              k
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 σ
                                 ˆ
                              
                           
                           
                              k
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      and then establishes the asymptotic distribution of proposed GLR 
                        ln
                        (
                        
                           Λ
                           ˆ
                        
                        (
                        Z
                        )
                        )
                     . Then, the demonstration of Theorems 5 and 6 is given in Appendix D.2.

Let us first recall that the observations
