                  The present paper proposes systematic designs of stable adaptive fuzzy logic controllers (AFLCs), employing hybridizations of Lyapunov strategy based approach (LSBA) and a contemporary stochastic optimization technique, for controlling the temperature of a thermal process in an air-heater system with transport-delay and in the presence of disturbances. Harmony search (HS) algorithm has been considered here as a candidate stochastic optimization technique utilized in conjunction with the Lyapunov theory to develop the hybrid models in this work. The objective of this work is to design stable adaptive fuzzy controllers which can provide high degree of automation, guarantee asymptotic stability and also achieve satisfactory transient performance by simultaneous adaptations of both the fuzzy controller structure and its free parameters. The results obtained from real-life experiments aptly demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.
