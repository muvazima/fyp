                  We propose a fast seed detection for automatic tracking of coronary arteries in coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA). To detect vessel regions, Hessian-based filtering is combined with a new local geometric feature that is based on the similarity of the consecutive cross-sections perpendicular to the vessel direction. It is in turn founded on the prior knowledge that a vessel segment is shaped like a cylinder in axial slices. To improve computational efficiency, an axial slice, which contains part of three main coronary arteries, is selected and regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted in the slice. Only for the voxels belonging to the ROIs, the proposed geometric feature is calculated. With the seed points, which are the centroids of the detected vessel regions, and their vessel directions, vessel tracking method can be used for artery extraction. Here a particle filtering-based tracking algorithm is tested. Using 19 clinical CCTA datasets, it is demonstrated that the proposed method detects seed points and can be used for full automatic coronary artery extraction. ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis shows the advantages of the proposed method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

As a non-invasive technique for coronary artery imaging, coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) has become a well-established method for the assessment of the heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the USA [1]. It can provide not only anatomical information on the coronary arteries but also pathological information such as presence and extent of calcifications, plaque burden, stenoses and occlusions, which are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of coronary arteries diseases [2]. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction (i.e., segmentation and visualization) of the coronary arteries from CCTA would lead to higher accuracy and reproducibility in the diagnosis and to better precision in the quantification of severity of the coronary arteries diseases than two-dimensional (2D) angiography or 3D reconstitution using multiple 2D angiograms [3]. A robust centerline extraction of coronary arteries, especially three main coronary arteries (i.e., RCA, LAD, and LCX), is essential for the 3D reconstruction and post-processing tools such as curved multi-planar reformatted (MPR) images through the lumen of each coronary artery. Furthermore, it is also one of the prerequisite steps in subsequent analysis, such as detection of lesions [4] and image fusion [5,6].

A significant amount of research has been done on the segmentation of vascular structures and of the coronary arteries in particular [7,8]. However, most of these vessel segmentation methods require user interaction: manual definition of the start and end points and vessel directions [9], or manual insertion of the intermediate points to bridge gaps [10–12]. Under these iterative segmentation methods, the accuracy of segmentation result is strongly dependent on the interaction from individual users. At the same time, a lack of reproducibility of the segmentation result is also a problem. A trade-off between robustness and automation has to be carried out whenever the segmentation algorithm is to be embedded in a commercial package for clinical applications. Moreover, a certain amount of interaction usually leads to the increment of the processing time.

To overcome the above-mentioned difficulties, several approaches were proposed for automatically tracking the coronary arteries. Tek et al. [13] detected ostium locations on the surface of aorta and then started the multi-scale medialness-based vessel tracking from the ostium locations. Kitslaar et al. [14] first detected the aorta and the entire heart region and a region growing technique started in the aorta and stopped when it had reached coronary tree candidate components. Bauer et al. [15] presented an automatic approach that consists of generic methods for detection of tubular objects, extraction of their centerlines, and grouping of these centerlines into tree structures. Zambal et al. [16] calculated candidates for coronary artery seeds by approximating the position of the heart and then cylindrical sampling patterns were fitted for extracting the vessel tree of coronary arteries. Kitamura et al. [17] proposed a method to learn a classifier of a tubular 3D object with a dimension reduction approach using Hessian analysis. Zhou et al. [18] segmented the vascular structures within the heart region using a multi-scale coronary response and then tracked the coronary arteries by a 3D dynamic balloon tracking algorithm.

Although these automatic methods tracked the centerlines of the coronary arteries, they did not take advantage of shape information of three main coronary arteries in CCTA as prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a fast seed detection algorithm for fully automatic tracking of coronary arteries in CCTA based on the prior knowledge that the three main coronary arteries (i.e., RCA, LAD, and LCX) are running almost perpendicular to axial slices and appearing as circular cross-sections in the middle of the heart. We first select an axial slice through the middle of scan range. Vessels are usually seen as small brighter circles in the selected slice. In the slice, we extract regions of interest (ROIs) using the successive application of heart region detection, Sobel edge detection, morphological opening operation, contour tracing, and shape analysis. And then, we select the final seed points for coronary arteries and estimate the vessel direction at each seed point using Hessian-based vesselness filtering incorporated with a new local geometric feature.

Frangi et al. [19] presented the Hessian-based vesselness filter, which measures the similarity to a tubular structure (F(x)) and obtains the vessel direction for each voxel. It has been widely used for the vessel enhancement in medical images. However, a major drawback of this filter is that the vesselness responses of voxels at the boundary of a non-vessel structure are as high as those of vessel voxels. Especially in CCTA, this response becomes more pronounced and may lead to a false extraction result, because cardiac chambers have similar CT density values to coronary arteries in CCTA [20]. To address this problem, Yang et al. [21] improved the Hessian-based vesselness filter using a local geometric feature (WF(x)), which is determined through ray-casting in a local sphere. However, their method requires connected component analysis, increasing the processing time. In this paper, we propose a new local geometric feature (GF(x)) by performing shape analysis of three continuous cross-sections, which are perpendicular to the vessel direction. The final seed points are determined as the centroids of individual detected vessel regions and the vessel direction at each seed point is obtained from eigenvectors of Hessian matrix at the voxel. Finally, with the detected seed points and their vessel direction vectors, a particle filtering-based tracking framework [9] is applied. Therefore, our proposed method can fully automatically extract the centerlines of the coronary arteries in CCTA.

                      illustrates the process of the automatic tracking of the coronary arteries in CCTA that consists of the following three major steps: (1) ROI selection in an axial slice in the middle of the heart; (2) seed points detection based on the Hessian-based vesselness filter incorporated with new local geometric feature; and (3) tracking of coronary arteries.

In CCTA, three main coronary arteries are running almost perpendicular to the axial slices and appearing as small brighter circles in the middle of the heart. We first select an axial slice which includes part of three main coronary arteries. The selected slice is located approximately the middle of the scan range and the index P of the selected slice is calculated as follows:
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 
                                    P

                                       c
                                       r
                                    
                                    ×
                                    N
                                 
                              
                           
                        where N is the number of total slices in a given CCTA scan and c
                        
                           r
                         is constant. c
                        
                           r
                         can be chosen flexibly in some range or several slices can be used at the same time (see Section 3).


                        Fig. 2
                         shows the ROIs selection procedure. Considering that coronary arteries are usually inside the heart region, a heart region detection technique [22] is applied to get only the heart region in the selected slice. All potential edges in the detected heart region are extracted using the Sobel edge detector and then all short edges are removed by an opening operation. And then, contour tracing [23] is used to extract a single line strokes for each edge component.

From a starting pixel of the current contour, the neighborhood is searched for the next traced pixel and the direction of the move from the previous traced pixel to the current traced pixel is stored in a variable dir[i], where i is the index of current traced pixel. Then the sum of absolute curvature K
                        
                           c
                         of each traced contour is defined and computed as follows:

                        where length L represents the number of the pixels belonging to the traced contour. For example, a circle of radius R has a curvature 1/R and its arc length is 2πR. Their multiplication is 2π which is invariant to radius of the circle. When the shape is complicated, K
                        
                           c
                         and L grow according to their complication and the size. 2π is the minimal value of K

                         that any closed curve can have and any number below 2π will be discarded since it is an open contour. Thus, the non-vessel structures can be removed by thresholding of length and curvature K
                        
                           c
                        . Fig. 3
                         shows some examples of the traced contours of vessel and non-vessel structures and Table 1
                         shows the values of the length and curvature of the traced contours in Fig. 3. The large structure (Fig. 3(f)) has large length and straight lines (Fig. 3(e), (g), and (h)) have small curvatures. The thresholds T

                         for the removal of these non-vessel skeletons were set to be 80 and 10, respectively.

After this shape analysis, for each candidate of vessel structure, a bounding box is obtained and it is called the ROI for that vessel candidate. Only for the pixels belonging to the ROIs, we implement a Hessian-based vesselness filter to detect the seed points for three main coronary arteries. Note that because the number of pixels within the ROIs is less than 1% of the total number of pixels in a slice image and one or several (to guarantee there are no missing coronary arteries) slices are used among hundreds of axial slices, the processing time of the next seed points detection step is significantly reduced.

To segment the vessel regions in medical images, Hessian-based vesselness filter [19] has been widely used. It measures the similarity to a tubular structure and finds the vessel direction for each voxel. The vesselness F(x) is obtained on the basis of all eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. However, this filter often suffers from the step-edge response at the boundary of a non-vessel structure. This step-edge response becomes more pronounced in CCTA, since cardiac chambers have the similar CT density values as coronary arteries, which can lead to a false extraction result. Therefore, it is difficult to determine a fixed threshold of vesselness response to clearly differentiate the vessel region and the boundary of the non-vessel structure.

In order to overcome this drawback, we propose a new local geometric feature GF(x) obtained by performing shape analysis of three cross-sections, which are perpendicular to the vessel direction. Considering the voxel at A as shown in Fig. 4
                        , the vessel direction is calculated as the eigenvector 
                           
                              
                                 v
                                 1
                              
                           
                         corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue λ
                        1 (|λ
                        1|≤|λ
                        2|≤|λ
                        3|) of the Hessian matrix at the voxel A. Based on the prior knowledge that a vessel segment is shaped like a cylinder, three UV-planes of the indices [−1,0,1] are obtained as the transverse cross-sections of the cylinder along the vessel direction 
                           
                              
                                 v
                                 1
                              
                           
                        . The center UV-plane [0] goes through voxel A and is perpendicular to the vessel direction at the voxel A. Note that a UV-plane does not have to be parallel to the axial plane and can be arbitrary oriented along 
                        
                           
                              
                                 v
                                 1
                              
                           
                        . The UV-planes [−1,1] are parallel to the UV-plane [0] with some distance D between two planes. The new local geometric feature is derived as the similarity between geometric shapes of these three cross-sections. On the each UV-plane [−1,0,1], rays are casted along 16 uniformly sampled directions as shown in Fig. 4 from the corresponding center points A′, A, and A″, respectively, where A′ and A″ are determined as follows:

Along each ray, the border point is detected using the radial gradient. The length of each ray represents the distance between the center point and the border point. For each center point, the rays are sorted according to the lengths of the rays and then three longest and three shortest rays are removed. Thus, each cross-section has ten rays and the length of each ray is denoted as d[i][j] where i and j represent the plane index [−1,0,1] and the ray index [1,…,10], respectively. The geometric shape of the cross-sections is characterized by the gray thin curves. For each ray index j
                        =[1,…,10], the minimum values B
                        min[j] and the maximum values B
                        max[j] among the three ray lengths d[−1,0,1][j] are calculated. Finally, the proposed local geometric feature is defined as follows:

                        where k is some constant. Fig. 5
                         shows an example of the profiles of the maximum and minimum values at vessel and non-vessel points. At the vessel point A, because the borders on three cross-sections are similar to each other, the minimum values are closer to the maximum values than at non-vessel points, resulting in a larger geometric feature value. On the other hand, at the non-vessel point E, the differences between the maximum and minimum values are much larger than those at vessel points, resulting in an insignificant geometric feature value. Physically, Eq. (4) measures the uniformity of the shapes of the cross-sections along the central axis of the vessel, i.e., through the plane indices of [−1,0,1].

For the tracking of coronary arteries, a particle filtering-based tracking algorithm [9] is used with the seed points, which are the centroids of the vessel regions detected in the previous step, and their corresponding vessel directions. The tracking algorithm considers a vessel segment as an ellipse in 3D space and segments it out by tracking the ellipses in a spatial sequence. With two initial parameters, of the location and the normal vector, the particle filtering sequentially tracked the center points of the ellipses. Therefore, by subsequently applying our seed detection method and the particle filtering-based tracking algorithm, three main coronary arteries are automatically segmented.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, 19 actual clinical CCTA datasets from different patients were tested. Each scan had about 250 slices with a matrix size of 512×512 and the pixel dimension was ranged from 0.301 to 0.357mm in the xy-plane and 0.5mm in the z-direction.

As described in Section 2.2 (Eq. (1)), an axial slice that includes part of three main coronary arteries is determined as the relative position in the total number of slices of the scan. For automatic selection of the axial slice, the relative position is set by a fixed parameter c
                     
                        r
                     . To find a reasonable c
                     
                        r
                     , we analyzed all of 19 CCTA scans. Fig. 6
                      shows lower and upper bounds of relative position of the axial slices which contain all seed points of three main coronary arteries. When c
                     
                        r
                      is set as 0.62, all ground truth seed points for coronary arteries are contained for all datasets. Also, several c
                     
                        r
                      values (c
                     
                        r
                     
                     =0.57, 0.62, 0.67) are tested and when the value is around 0.62 all three coronary arteries are seen and detected in the test. For c
                     
                        r
                     
                     =0.57 in two cases, LDA was missing. For c
                     
                        r
                     
                     =0.67, in five cases out of 19, one coronary vessel point was missing. If several values are used for c
                     
                        r
                      together, i.e., if multi slices are used, the coronary seed points always exist in the axial slices. The problems of choosing c
                     
                        r
                      can be avoided by using several slices together. However, the selection and dependency of axial slices should be investigated further in the future work.

                      shows the results of ROI selection and seed detection. The left column shows the original axial slices multiple vessel cross-sections including three main coronary arteries. The middle column shows the mask images of the selected ROIs. For the voxels belonging to these ROIs, the Hessian-based vesselness filter combined with the proposed local geometric feature GF(x) is applied. Then, the right column shows the mask images of the detected vessel regions. The seed points for automatic tracking of the main coronary arteries were initialized as the centroid of these detected vessel regions.

                      compares the results of the Hessian-based vesselness filtering. Fig. 8(a) is the original axial slices. Fig. 8(b) and (c) shows the detected vessel regions by the Frangi's Hessian-based vesselness F(x) with two low and high thresholds T
                     
                        F
                     , respectively. In Fig. 8(b), with the low T
                     
                        F
                     , the regions R1–R4 which belong to non-vessel structures are still remained. Increasing the threshold T
                     
                        F
                      to remove these non-vessel regions R1–R4 caused the erroneous removal of the vessel region R0. On the other hand, our vesselness filtering incorporating with the proposed local geometrical feature successfully extracted all vessel regions. By combining low T
                     
                        F
                      with T
                     
                        GF
                     , it is possible to remove all unwanted region R1–R4, as shown in Fig. 8(d).


                     Table 2
                      shows the values of Frangi's vesselness F(x), Yang's geometric feature WF(x), and our proposed geometric feature GF(x), at some pixels of the vessel and non-vessel regions in Fig. 8. When using only Frangi's vesselness F(x), the pixel A of vessel region R0 was not differentiated from the pixels B and C of vessel regions R1 and R2. In contrast, using Yang's geometric feature WF(x) or our geometric feature GF(x), the pixel A of vessel region R0 was easily differentiated from the pixels B–E of non-vessel regions R1–R4 because WF(x) and GF(x) values at the pixels B–E are closed to 0. For the pixels A–E, the two geometric features WF(x) and GF(x) have similar values to each other. Fig. 9
                      compares the mask images of the detected vessel regions using the two geometric features WF(x) and GF(x).

To confirm the usefulness of the proposed seed point detection method, the centerline extraction via particle filtering-based tracking framework is tested [8] with the seed points and their vessel directions. And it is compared to the coronary arteries obtained by the commercial software QAngioCT (Medis medical imaging systems, Leiden, the Netherlands). As an example shown in Fig. 10
                     , the shape of the extracted centerlines from the proposed method was tantamount to that from QAngioCT. In all the dataset, the seed points reside inside of the correct coronary arteries which are marked by medical experts. This confirms that our seed point detection method provides correct starting points and directions.

Finally, the proposed detection method is extensively tested in comparison to conventional vessel detection methods [18,20] using ROC (receiver operator characteristic) curve analysis. Fig. 11
                      and Table 3
                      show a significant improvement in the AUC (area under curve, 0.80) compared to Frangi's method [18] (0.70) and a comparable result to Yang's method [20] (0.81).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this paper, we proposed fast seed detection for automatic tracking of coronary arteries in CCTA. Considering that three main coronary arteries (i.e., RCA, LAD, and LCX) are running through to the axial images and appearing as circular or elliptical cross-sections in the middle of heart, in our approach, a single axial slice, which preferably contains all seed points for the three main coronary arteries but not indispensable, is selected. If several axial slices are used together by using multiple c
                     
                        r
                      values, the existence of all three coronary arteries can be guaranteed. And then, by consecutive execution of heart region detection, Sobel edge detection, morphological opening operation, contour tracing, and shape analysis, ROIs are extracted. To cut down the number of computation and reduce the false positive detection of seed points, only for the pixels belonging to the ROIs, the Hessian-based vesselness filter combined with the proposed local geometric feature is calculated to remove unwanted non-vessel pixels at the boundaries of the cardiac chambers and to detect the seed points for main coronary arteries. Finally, to find overall feasibility of the our proposed methods, with the detected seed points and their vessel direction vectors, an automatic tracking framework using the particle filtering [9] is applied and tested.

For detection of the vessel pixels in medical images, the Hessian-based vesselness filter [19] has been widely used as an advanced framework of a set of linear filters one of which is composed of properly shifted Gaussian kernels [24]. It measures the similarity to a tubular structure F(x) and obtains the vessel direction for each voxel based on the eigenvalues of Hessian matrix. But this filter has strong step-edge responses at non-vessel pixels of cardiac chamber boundaries, which have similar CT density values to coronary arteries in CCTA. Therefore, it may lead to false extractions [20]. To address this problem, Yang et al. [21] improved the Hessian-based vesselness filter using a local geometric feature WF(x), which is determined through ray-casting in a local sphere. We propose a new local geometric feature GF(x) based on the shape analysis of three or more cross-sections, which are perpendicular to the vessel direction. Unlike Yang's local geometric feature WF(x) using the connected component analysis, our new local geometric feature GF(x) measures the similarity of only three cross-sections, which are perpendicular to the vessel direction, based on the prior knowledge that a vessel segment is shaped like a cylinder. Therefore, the computational efficiency can be improved significantly.

Also the ROC curve study shows the advantage of the proposed method. Overall, it shows better performance than Hessian based technique [18] and comparable to Yang's [20] and it is much faster than Yang's since our ROI reduces the number of computation significantly.

Another advantage of our method other than the aforementioned accurate and fast performances is that detection of seed points for coronary arteries are not restricted to ostium from the aorta which is much bigger and brighter than the coronary arteries. Most conventional methods including commercial software systems like QAngioCT depend on aorta detection and then ostium of coronary arteries. Using our seed detection, the location and normal vector of a single seed point is initialized as the centroid of the detected vessel region and the vessel direction at the centroid. Thus, the coronary arteries in CCTA can be extracted automatically, even for selective coronary CT angiographic images with intra-arterial injection of contrast agent where the aorta is not enhanced at all.

However, our method has some limitation and concerns. For limitation, our local geometric feature depends strongly on the assumption that a vessel segment is shaped like a cylinder. Therefore, when the selected slice cuts the coronary arteries at the bifurcation region, we may miss these vessels because the cross-section is not circular at the bifurcation region. As a concern, although all CCTA scans used in this study have at least more than one slices containing all seed points for three main coronary arteries and the selection of an axial slice in the first step is successfully performed, it is still possible that there is no axial slice including all part of three main coronary arteries. For such case, a few axial slices apart from each can be used to assure they enclose all three coronary arteries. For this case, at least two axial slices have to be selected. One slice is for RCA's seed point and the other is for LAD's and LCX's seed points.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, a new fast seed detection method was developed for automated coronary artery extraction from CCTA. First of all, to raise robustness of the Hessian-based filtering, we devised a new local geometric feature. Computational efficiency was also improved by selecting only one or several axial slices, which are located in mid parts of three main coronary arteries, and even on those slices by limiting calculation of the geometric features into a number of ROIs. With the detected seed points, which are the centroids of the detected vessel regions, and their vessel directions, vessel tracking method can be used for artery extraction. The test with 19 clinical CCTA datasets using a particle filtering-based tracking algorithm demonstrated that the proposed method can detect seed points and may be used to initialize fully automatic coronary artery extraction. ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis shows the advantage of the proposed method.
