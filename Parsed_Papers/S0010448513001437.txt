                  In this work, a new hole patching method (namely as, HPDE) is proposed to repair the damaged or ill-scanned three dimensional objects in real engineering applications. Our method differentiates from other related algorithms mainly on the following three aspects. Firstly, our algorithm sufficiently utilizes the point information around the considered hole for each prediction by constructing point correspondences on both sides of the boundary curve of the hole; secondly, the missing points in the hole region are predicted by the algorithm of differential evolution (DE), which is used to obtain the topological and geometrical structures of the mesh in the hole region; thirdly, operations of mesh optimization are adopted for improving the quality of the obtained triangulation mesh. Numerical results on kinds of holes with complex shape and large curvature, and a comparison with two recently proposed algorithms verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, further experiments on the noisy data points illustrate the robustness of the algorithm against noise.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Methods for constructing a mathematical model from a given set of three dimensional (3D) points have been applied into a wide variety of fields, such as engineering design, virtual reality, movie making and data visualization. Surface reconstruction has drawn much attention from last decades of years and a lot of methods are reported  [1–4]. It is more often that the provided points are represented with piecewise triangles (namely as triangulation model), such as the Marching Cubes method in  [5], the crust algorithm in  [6], direct advancing front method and modified decimation method in  [7], and a divide and conquer Delaunay triangulation in  [8].

However, the constructed model may not be directly applicable for the real application. In one case, the provided triangulation model is damaged or the points in the considered model are ill-scanned. In another case, the provided 3D points can also be the measured parameter values from the simulation experiments, and it may come up that the data referring the parameter values in the abnormal conditions is difficult to be obtained by the simulations, which may be the result from the difficulty of these experiments or the high cost and time-consuming of the simulation. For these two cases, there still exist concerned regions (hole regions) where the point information is unknown and needs to be predicted based on the constructed model, thus, the hole patching method is resorted to.

In this work, a new hole patching method (HPDE) based on defective triangulation model is devised to patch challenging holes with large curvature. Based on the boundary points and boundary directional vectors, the proposed HPDE utilizes algorithms of differential evolution (DE) and constrained triangulation sequently to obtain the topological and geometrical structures of the triangulation mesh in the hole region, which is further resorted to the algorithms of smoothing and mesh optimization to improve the mesh quality. The proposed HPDE differs from other hole patching methods mainly on the following aspects. (1) The proposed HPDE combines the frequently used algorithms of DE, constrained triangulation and mesh optimization in the application of hole patching. (2) Different from other algorithms obtaining the topological structure in advance, our method obtains the topological and geometrical structures of the mesh in the hole region at the same time. (3) HPDE sufficiently utilizes the directional vectors at each two corresponding base points on the boundary curve around the considered hole for the prediction, which is different from other algorithms either using only one side of boundary information or not using the directional vectors at the boundary points.

This paper is organized as follows. Some related work of hole patching are introduced in Section  2. Section  3 presents the description of the classical DE algorithm. The proposed HPDE is described in Section  4. Section  5 presents all the numerical results on some kinds of test models. Finally, some discussions and conclusions are given in Sections  6 and 7, respectively.

Method of hole patching is to fill in a considered region by expanding the constructed model around the region. For the hole patching, the surrounding region of the hole region is filled with the point information of the constructed model, then hole regions are patched with the methods which are similar to interpolation by incorporating this information. A few methods referring to the hole patching have been sprang up in the past few years. Based on the representation of the constructed model, these methods are summarized into mainly two categories, one is volume-based, the other is surface-based.

Generally, the volume-based methods patch the holes by first assigning signs to a set of voxels with a signed distance function, then the point information in hole region is completed in the volume representation, which is used to approximately obtain the missing interface of the geometry by some surface-extracting methods such as the marching cubes method. The model with holes was converted to the volumetric representation, on which form the model was naturally repaired by parity count method or ray stabbing method, then the repaired model was converted back to a waterproof polygonal model  [9]. The surface model was first converted to the model with volume representation, then a diffusion was employed to extend the surface to form a watertight model [10]. This method can deal with geometrically and topologically complex holes. A novel hole-filling algorithm was proposed for volumetric objects where not only the outer surface of 3D objects but also the solid volumetric objects were closed filled  [11]. The main disadvantage of these volume-based methods is that they may miss some important features of the original model when converting to and from a volume, although these methods can often produce a watertight model in a robust way.

The surface-based methods deal with the data points directly and they often utilize the information in a local region around the considered hole. For these surface-based methods, the topological structure of the triangulation mesh in the hole region is first obtained, then the geometrical structure is obtained by some other algorithms. The defects and holes were proposed to be repaired by a 3D triangulation method which is to minimize the total sum of edge lengths by dynamic programming  [12]. The constrained triangulation of the unfolded 3D points on a plane was embedded into the triangular mesh by minimizing an energy surface  [13]. The radial basis function interpolator using neighboring edges was employed to fill the holes  [14]. The topological structure of the prediction points in the hole region was obtained by the advancing front method, and the geometric structure of these points was determined by solving the Poisson equation  [15]. The surface-based approach and a two-step volume-based method-heat diffusion and the Poisson surface reconstruction were incorporated to repair holes with geometric and topological complexities [16]. It was proposed that complex polygonal holes were filled in a piecewise manner so as to obtain the entire hole triangulation with the piecewise planar triangulation  [17]. The patching mesh in hole region was obtained by iteratively refining and smoothing the preciously optimized mesh according to the lengths of the adjacent triangles, based on an initial triangulation mesh of the boundary points of the considered hole region  [18,19]. A grey prediction model was proposed to predict and adjust the coordinates of the newly added points by obtaining two controlled variables—the normal vector and the included angle size  [20], this method tends to maintain the variation trend of the boundary points by utilizing the point information adjacent to the prediction points. While the used point information is only on one side of the boundary, the variation trend from one side to another side in the hole region cannot be detected, which may result in losing fidelity for holes where the points vary uniformly from one side to the other. The hole regions were patched with non-uniform rational B-spline surface by utilizing several layers of adjacent triangles  [21], this method first obtains several interpolation spline curves using some adjacent points around the hole region, then some discrete points in the hole region are extracted from these interpolation curves, which are used for a B-spline surface interpolation to obtain the geometrical structure of the triangulation mesh. Because of the characteristic of the B-spline function that the shape taken by the spline is with minimum elastic energy, the patched surface in the hole region is apt to be flat which may also result in losing fidelity.

These reported methods adopt their own strategies to predict the points in the hole region, and achieve competitive results on their concerned test models. However, how to sufficiently utilize the information around the considered hole and how to effectively handle challenging holes are still hot topics in this field.

As a stochastic algorithm which is first proposed in  [22,23], DE and its variants are frequently adopted in various kinds of real engineering applications  [24]. Different from classical gradient-based optimization algorithms, DE adopts one greedy strategy to proceed to global optimum from multiple positions of the searching region based on a random generated population. Without utilizing the gradient information of the objective function, DE is often the real alternative for a variety of non-differentiable and non-convex problems which are difficult for gradient-based algorithms.

This overall algorithm is based on the damaged triangulation model of a 3D object. When it is provided with a set of 3D points, triangulation model needs to be constructed in this step. This step also includes operation of smoothing procedure when the provided points are noisy. In this work, an easy-to-implement form of smoothing method in  [26] is adopted, which is reported to be able to avoid surface shrinkage by conducting a Gaussian filter step and an un-shrinking smoothing step consecutively.

The boundary curve around a hole is a closed path which is composed of a set of edges of the adjacent triangles, where there are at least one edge which does not have adjacent triangles for these triangles. A hole identification method was proposed in  [14] by studying the torsion of the contour curve, which can distinguish the natural holes from those man-made holes.

Besides of the boundary curve, a ring of adjacent triangles around the considered hole are obtained (see Fig. 4), and a set of dense base points

Because the following triangulation is conducted on the projected prediction points on a 3D plane, overlapping or self-intersection may occur when these prediction points are high curled, in which case, the points need to be divided and processed with respect to (w.r.t.) two planes separately. In this step, we judge whether the boundary points and the following prediction points need to be segmented, which is stated in the following.

The approximately optimal segmentation of the boundary base points is determined by a few tries through the principal component analysis (PCA) method in the following. It is implied in  [1] that the size of the smallest eigenvalue of PCA with a set of 3D points determines the degree of approximation of these points to a plane, and the smaller the smallest eigenvalue compared to the largest eigenvalue, the more approximated to a plane these points are. Thus, the larger of the two smallest eigenvalues through the PCA method is minimized to obtain the optimal segmentation by the following optimization problem.

                        (a) is segmented, which determines two planes

The prediction of the proposed HPDE is conducted between each pair of base points, the correspondences of all the base points on the boundary are found and modified in this step. If the boundary base points are segmented, the correspondences of the indexes of the base points are mandatorily determined as follows:

When the base points need not to be segmented, to obtain good correspondences, the sum of all the clamping distances between the corresponding points should be minimized to reduce the uncertainty in the hole region and to sufficiently utilize the adjacent information around the hole. The minimization of the clamping distances is approximated by optimizing the problem in Eq. (10) w.r.t. a starting position

The preceding obtained correspondences need to be slightly modified to exclude the case that the intersection angle of the boundary and the line linking two corresponding points is close to zero. The modification is conducted by directly skipping the base points which render the intersection angle being smaller than a critical angle

                              •
                              The distances between each two consecutive points should be equal.

The intersection angles of each pair of consecutive connection lines of the prediction points should be equal.

                                 V
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           ,
                           T
                           
                              
                                 V

                         have the same direction.

In this step, the 2D constrained triangulation method  [27] is conducted on the projections of the boundary points and the prediction points. When the base points are segmented which is determined in the second step, the prediction points and the base points are projected onto two adjoining planes, which are then unfolded to an unique plane in 3D. The prediction points in Fig. 1(a) are projected onto two planes 
                           α
                         and 
                           β
                         in Fig. 1(b), which are unfolded onto an unique plane 
                           α
                        . When the boundary points are not divided, all the points are directly projected to the fitting plane determined by the PCA method. The plane 
                           α
                         along with the corresponding projected points are further rotated onto a plane parallel to the 
                           x
                           y
                        -plane in 3D space (see Fig. 1(c)). Finally, the constrained triangulation method in 2D space is conducted on all the projection points, the obtained topology of the triangulation mesh is applied to the original 3D prediction points (see Fig. 1(d)).

The last step of the method is to smooth and optimize the obtained triangulation of the predicted points and the boundary points. The obtained triangulation is always smoothed for

                         times for all the test problems in this work. All the smoothed predicted points are denoted as 
                           
                              {

                        .

To further improve the triangulation mesh, mesh optimization methods  [28,29] including triangle simplification and edge swapping are employed. The simplification operation is to decimate the points being too close to other points, the swapping operation is to decrease those long and narrow triangles.

To avoid searching in the entire points and triangles when finding the holes and adjacent points and triangles, a special data structure is employed to alleviate the burden of the time cost. Each coordinate is partitioned into many small equidistant intervals according to the minimum and maximum values of the coordinate of all the provided points, then the equidistant interval that the coordinate of each point lies in is stored. Based on the stored information, the searching of the adjacent triangles is confined in a small region which is composed of a small proportion of points and triangles, because the points lie in a local region of the considered point share the adjacent coordinate intervals.

The overall algorithm is realized by the popular software MATLAB of version 2009b on a PC with a core processor operating at 2.8 GHZ with 4 GB of RAM. To check the effectiveness of the proposed method, several different kinds of holes are chosen for the numerical test, which are mainly divided into two categories—natural holes and manual holes. The natural holes are extracted from the Stanford bunny model, while the manual holes are derived from the models of an unitary sphere, the elephant, the gargoyle  [30] and an unitary cube, which are divided into the kinds of large holes, irregular holes, fringe holes, holes on complex model and holes with high curvature or characteristic line. The numbers of points and triangles in these models are demonstrated in Table 1
                           .

To test the performance of the method, mainly two aspects—the prediction error and runtime (RT) with unit in second (s) are considered. The prediction errors are computed w.r.t. the patching of manual holes, which includes the maximum prediction error (MPE) and the average prediction error (APE). These errors are computed as follows:

The results about the prediction errors, runtime and some information about the intermediate parameters and the holes are demonstrated in Table 1. The performance of these hole patching are demonstrated in Figs. 6–15

A further comparison of our method and two recently proposed algorithms  [20,21] (we code their algorithms) on holes of the sphere, elephant and horn is conducted, the numerical results of the comparison are presented in Table 2
                            and the performance of these algorithms on one sphere hole are depicted in Fig. 16
                           . Besides of the comparison with recently proposed algorithms, another two softwares MeshLab and ReMESH are chosen for the comparison. The patching results on one hole of the sphere model are demonstrated in Fig. 17
                           .

Furthermore, holes with characteristic lines are patched with the proposed HPDE, the results are demonstrated in  Fig. 15. Two models are chosen for this test, one is an unitary cube, the other is an inclined prism generated by translating the up face of the unitary cube a distance of 0.25 in the 
                              x
                            axis direction. The manual holes always contain a border line of the considered models.

To test the robustness of the method against noise, noises of uniform distribution 
                              
                                 [

                                 σ
                                 ]
                              
                            with different intensities are added into the original data points, where 
                              σ
                            is a scale factor that reflects the intensity of the noise, we consider the values of 1%, 3% and 5% in our trials. The perturbed points are first triangulated by the crust algorithm in  [6], then the proposed HPDE is employed to patch the abandoned hole region after which the adjacent points around the hole are smoothed by the approach described in the first step of the proposed HPDE. Results of HPDE w.r.t. the holes on the noisy sphere models are depicted in Fig. 18
                           .

                            are automatically determined by the average length of the edges around the hole, these parameters determine the number of overall prediction points

                            which consequently determine the accuracy and the time complexity of the prediction. The effect of the number

                            on the prediction accuracy is also studied, the results of the means and the variances (DE algorithm is stochastic-based) of the prediction accuracy are presented in  Fig. 19
                           .

Results in Figs. 6–13 illustrate that the proposed HPDE achieves reasonable results for natural holes, large holes, fringe holes, irregular holes and holes on the complex model. Results of the prediction error and the runtime in Table 1 provide further proof of the statement, where the maximum prediction errors for these kinds of holes do not exceed 1.77E−02, while the average prediction errors reach

                            for all the test problems. The runtime for the patching is maintained at reasonable level which is approximately 4 s for each manual hole, which increases to 5 s for each natural holes because the searching of the adjacent triangles and points consumes more time than the former. The holes on the sphere model and the fringe of the elephant model are demonstrated with large curvatures, the proposed HPDE still achieves sound performance in Figs. 6, 8 and 12 and the average prediction errors also achieve

                                    0

                           . Thus, the proposed HPDE is applicable for patching the holes with large curvature.

From Fig. 3, it can be seen that the prediction points are bounded by the circular arcs determined by the two endpoint vectors. Because of the limitation of this prediction strategy, the proposed HPDE is not suitable to patch holes with very high curvature where the points exceed the bounded region of these circular arcs. The patching result of a hole with high curvature in Fig. 14 illustrates the statement, where the tip of the damaged horn on the gargoyle model is not finely recovered.

Referring to the holes with characteristic lines, an average prediction error of 6.37E−03 is achieved for the patching results in three different situations shown in Fig. 15. Correspond to Fig. 15(a)–(c), the average prediction errors on the holes of a cube and an inclined prism are 4.02E−03, 6.16E−03 and 8.93E−03 by the algorithms of HPDE without smoothing operator, HPDE and HPDE, respectively. For patching this kind of holes, the smoothing operator and the operation of segmenting the base points are critical.

For analyzing the function of the smoothing operator, it can be seen from Fig. 15(a) and (b) that the smoothing operator is not beneficial to patch this kind of holes, because the smoothing procedure polishes the characteristic line on the border line of a cube. In other words, the smoothing operator determines that the intersection angles between the prediction points in the hole are uniform and the patching surface is smooth. Thus, this operator is impossible to detect the characteristic lines in the hole which are often with sharp lines or cusp. To analyze the function of the segmentation procedure on the prediction, the differences between Fig. 15(b) and (c) are considered. Notice that the base points in Fig. 15(c) are not segmented because the dihedral angle of the two faces where the hole lies on is larger than

                                    2

                            is adopted in HPDE), while the base points are segmented in Fig. 15(b). It is shown in Fig. 15(b) and (c) that segmenting the base points is beneficial to patch holes containing characteristic lines. By segmenting the base points, the overall prediction is divided into several parts, and the patching surface needed to predict in each part shares more characteristics with the respectively adjacent points and triangles, which yields more accurate prediction results in whole. However, the characteristic in the hole is still not finely recovered because of the smoothing operation (see Fig. 15(b)).

The results of the comparison in Table 2 illustrate that our algorithm achieves competitive APE on the considered test problems of sphere and elephant1 although more runtime are needed. Concretely, for relatively flat holes (such as the holes on elephant2), the proposed HPDE reaches a prediction accuracy similar to the accuracies obtained by the other two algorithms. For holes with very high curvature (such as the hole on the horn model), HPDE achieves a prediction accuracy between the other two algorithms. While for holes with large curvature (such as the holes on the sphere and elephant1), HPDE obtains the highest prediction accuracies compared with the other two algorithms. Notice that the method  [21] with non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surface is apt to obtain a flat surface in the hole region because of the characteristic of spline interpolation as illustrated in Section  2, this algorithm obtains the best accuracy for relatively flat holes. While the algorithm  [20] with grey prediction (GREY) is apt to maintain the boundary because the point information only on one side of the boundary is used in each point prediction, thus, this algorithm achieves the least prediction errors for holes with very high curvature. The proposed HPDE utilizes the point information on both sides of the boundary by constructing point correspondences, and the prediction points in the hole region are bounded between two circular arcs, therefore, it achieves the least prediction errors for those holes with moderately large curvature and balances the prediction results between holes with small and high curvatures.

                                    N
                                 
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                              
                            is a large number. Thus, the proposed HPDE needs more runtime on the test problems than the other two algorithms.

It can be seen from Table 2 that the proposed HPDE consumes more time than another two considered algorithms on the test problems. Coincide with the above analysis of the time complexities, the runtime costs are mostly concentrated on the DE optimization and the mesh optimization in the executions of HPDE, which account for proportions of 43% and 38% of the overall time costs on average.

Considering the comparison of the results of the proposed HPDE and two softwares, the hole patching algorithms (abbreviated as LMesh and RMesh, respectively) adopted in the softwares of MeshLab and ReMesh come from  [18] (without mesh refinement and fairing) and  [19], respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 17 that the algorithm LMesh without mesh refinement and fairing patches the holes with a triangulation of a flat plane. The algorithm RMesh patches the holes with a local triangulation matching the boundary of the considered hole, while the sizes of the triangles are not uniform enough and parts of the patching triangulation are not smoothed. It is demonstrated in Fig. 17 that the proposed HPDE achieves competitive result on this hole compared with the patching results obtained by these two softwares.

Further experimental results about the patching of the holes on noisy model show that the average prediction errors w.r.t. the three abandoned holes are 0.016, 0.039 and 0.056, respectively, which increase with an approximate quantity of 
                              0.01
                            compared with the intensities of the corresponding added noises. Incorporated with the performance of the hole patching in Fig. 18, it is concluded that HPDE is robust against the low-intensity of noise.

It is shown in Fig. 19 that APE varies in the region of [7.0E−03, 9.0E−03] when 
                              M
                              ⋅
                              n
                              /
                              2
                            varies in the region of [350, 650], which illustrates that initially selected number of prediction points 
                              M
                              ⋅
                              n
                              /
                              2
                            does not significantly affect the APE on the sphere hole. Thus, appropriate values of the parameters 
                              M
                              ,
                              n
                            can be flexibly selected to comprehensively consider of the accuracy, the runtime and the consistence of the edges in and around the hole region. Considering of the parameter 
                              N
                              u

                              y
                           , the prediction error varies in the region of [7.0E−03, 8.4E−03] when 
                              N
                              u

                              y
                            varies in the region of [40, 75], thus, the prediction accuracy is not significantly affected by the small perturbation of the parameter 
                              N
                              u

                              y
                           , which implies HPDE is not sensitive to the parameter

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

A new hole patching algorithm is proposed in this work, to cover the shortages of the previously related algorithms, the proposed algorithm predicts the points in holes by utilizing the point correspondences of two layers of base points around the holes, and it obtains uniformly distributed points in the hole by solving an optimization problem and employing a mesh simplification. Although good performance of our algorithm is achieved on kinds of holes of the considered models, some more work needs to be continued to further improve the proposed algorithm.

First, the proposed HPDE for hole filling is mainly concentrated on those topologically simple and geometrically complex holes, the prediction strategy needs to be modified for those more topologically complex holes. Meanwhile, because the topology of the prediction points is obtained by the constrained triangulation on a rotated 3D plane, more intermediate 3D planes are needed for the projection of the predicted points when the holes are more complex, an efficient and automatic method to construct these planes needs to be proposed.

Second, the proposed HPDE is suitable to patch holes with large curvature, while it yields inaccurate results for holes with very high curvature because the prediction points are bounded between two circular arcs, for the latter kind of holes, the restricted arcs need to be modified correspondingly.

Third, another aspect to improve HPDE is to detect and utilize some feature lines around the considered hole region for the prediction, and the strategies for selecting the points with uniform distances and rotational angles in the hole region need to be correspondingly modified according to these feature lines. Moreover, the smoothing operator in the proposed HPDE should be adopted selectively, and the base points can be segmented into more parts and projected to more planes to maintain these characteristics.

Fourth, although competitive prediction accuracies of the proposed HPDE on the test problems are confirmed in Section  5, comparisons of time complexities and numerical results in Section  5.2.3 demonstrate that the proposed HPDE consumes more time than another two considered algorithms on the test problems, several measures will be considered to decrease the time cost. From one aspect, the number of iteration 
                        N
                        u
                        m
                        I
                        t
                        e
                        r
                      in DE algorithm can be reduced by adopting more powerful DE version  [25], from another aspect, the number of prediction points in the hole region can be decreased or the number of decimated triangles will be reduced.

Finally, in the practical application, it may exist some more unusual holes, such as shown in Fig. 20
                     . To deal with these cases with the proposed HPDE, some preprocessing operations (similar as in  [20]) corresponding to the first case in Fig. 20 are needed and the prediction strategies corresponding to the second case in Fig. 20 should be slightly modified to make use of the fragmental information in the hole.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this work, a new hole patching method HPDE is proposed, which completes the defective triangulation model with set by set prediction points through DE algorithm. Different from other hole patching methods, the proposed HPDE utilizes the point information on both sides of the boundary in each prediction, and it obtains the topological and geometrical structures of the patching mesh in the hole region at the same time, then two approaches of mesh optimization are resorted to improve the quality of local mesh by the locally constrained triangulation. Numerical results on triangulation models with different kinds of holes show the effectiveness of HPDE and that the proposed HPDE is suitable for patching the holes with large curvature. The results of the comparison of HPDE and another two related algorithms demonstrate that HPDE is rather competitive on the considered test models.

Because of the good performance of the proposed HPDE on the considered test models, we expect to apply the method into more fields and more actual problems. Our future work will also concentrate on alleviating and eliminating the defects of the proposed method stated in the discussion section.
