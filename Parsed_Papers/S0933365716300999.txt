                  Purpose
                  Explore how efficient intelligent decision support systems, both easily understandable and straightforwardly implemented, can help modern hospital managers to optimize both bed occupancy and utilization costs.
               
               
                  Methods and materials
                  This paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm-queuing multi-compartment model for the patient flow in hospitals. A finite capacity queuing model with phase-type service distribution is combined with a compartmental model, and an associated cost model is set up. An evolutionary-based approach is used for enhancing the ability to optimize both bed management and associated costs. In addition, a “What-if analysis” shows how changing the model parameters could improve performance while controlling costs. The study uses bed-occupancy data collected at the Department of Geriatric Medicine – St. George's Hospital, London, period 1969–1984, and January 2000.
               
               
                  Results
                  The hybrid model revealed that a bed-occupancy exceeding 91%, implying a patient rejection rate around 1.1%, can be carried out with 159 beds plus 8 unstaffed beds. The same holding and penalty costs, but significantly different bed allocations (156 vs. 184 staffed beds, and 8 vs. 9 unstaffed beds, respectively) will result in significantly different costs (£755 vs. £1172). Moreover, once the arrival rate exceeds 7 patient/day, the costs associated to the finite capacity system become significantly smaller than those associated to an Erlang B queuing model (£134 vs. £947).
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  Encoding the whole information provided by both the queuing system and the cost model through chromosomes, the genetic algorithm represents an efficient tool in optimizing the bed allocation and associated costs. The methodology can be extended to different medical departments with minor modifications in structure and parameterization.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The problem of how to allocate healthcare resources has become increasingly pressing today. One of the major issues is the cost of the healthcare system in relation to its efficiency. The natural limitation of the allocated resources leads to the need for better management. Without an efficient management, the healthcare system will not be able to offer high quality patient care with affordable costs. One of the means to achieve a better management of the clinical facilities is the appropriate use of beds. This is directly connected to the patient flow through hospital, based on the progression of the health status. There are currently published data regarding this issue, Eurostat/European Commission – “Health care facilities” presenting an updated description of the hospital beds situation throughout the European Union [1] 
                     http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/Annexes/hlth_res_esms_an9.pdf [accessed 19.10.15]. A key solution for the effective management of healthcare resources is the optimization of bed occupancy and associated costs.

Queuing theory, particularly, is widely used in making decisions to improve the customer service in various fields, including healthcare. The rich literatures regarding the contributions and applications of queuing theory in healthcare, along with useful information to model a healthcare process, have been recently reviewed in [2]. Finite-capacity queuing systems are often used in healthcare. In [3], the authors study a queuing system with finite-capacity buffer and a two-phase Cox distribution for service. The proposed methodology is applied to optimize a geriatric care unit by using an empirical analysis of the model and numerical calculations. Because queuing systems allow the use of simulation models for planning bed inventory in hospitals, the authors of [4] developed a simulation model, based on queuing theory, used for planning the bed capacity. A queuing model is applied in [5] to improve the quality of healthcare service. The authors propose a M/Ek/c system to model an orthopedic ward service aiming to determine both the optimal number of beds and the average loss of revenue across different wards. A queuing network with different priority classes of customers was used for Emergency Departments [6]. The authors propose a continuous-time Markov chain to analyze several hospital systems in order to assess the impact of systems resources on offload delays.

Inspired by the compartmental kinetics, the patient flow may be described as the behavior of a drug in the body. Compartmental models have previously been shown to provide a suitable description of the patient flow through a hospital department. Starting with a deterministic two-compartment mathematical model [7], they went on to make further progress when stochastic models, along with mixed exponential distributions, were proposed [8,9].

Previous work [10,11] has introduced two queuing models (M/PH/c and M/PH/c/N) in order to optimize the use of hospital resources. They enable the estimation of the probability of lost demands and the mean number of patients in hospital. Both approaches face a trade-off between the costs of empty beds and the cost of turning patients away, solved by introducing a cost function. The direct estimation of several values regarding the rejection probability and the associated cost, computed for different parameter settings, has been used for the optimization purpose. For the sake of simplicity, since the rejection probability and the associated cost are multivariable functions, their evaluation has been based on approximate computation (rejection probability), and graphical estimation (cost function). The former has been computed by varying only one parameter at a time, while a two-dimensional graph representing indifference curves has been used for the latter. Moderate accuracy has been a direct consequence of this approximation methodology. To overcome this empirical computation, the current work proposes a flexible strategy for the optimization of hospital bed occupancy and associated costs, based on the evolutionary paradigm. The mathematical model for the patient flow has been developed by combining elements of queuing theory with results from compartmental models in conjunction with phase-type distributions. An associated cost model has been set up in order to balance the expenses related to refusing patients and with maintaining the necessary number of beds. The methodology used in this paper is a modeling/simulation process in two steps. The first one consists in formalizing the flow of patients and associated costs. The former is modeled by means of both a finite capacity queuing model and a compartmental model, while the latter is achieved by using a base-stock policy approach [12]. The second one, based on the use of a genetic algorithm (GA), enables the exploitation of this formalization to optimize both the inpatient bed occupancy and associated costs. The work has two objectives. Firstly, we estimated the optimal values of the parameters defining the background queuing model in order to achieve a probability of a patient being turned away of no more than a pre-specified threshold. Secondly, we estimated the optimal values of the bed inventory and of the penalty and holding costs in order to minimize the long-run average associated cost. In addition, a “What-if analysis” has also been performed to highlight how changing the model parameters could improve performance while controlling costs. The achievement of these goals provides the hospital managers with a flexible and effective tool to simulate different possible scenarios, allowing them to improve and optimize the management of their unit. Different from the existing papers in literature, our approach uses the evolutionary paradigm in order to optimize both bed allocation and associated costs. It takes into account the diverse nature of the model parameters (both discrete and continuous), and considers the main system outcomes (rejection probability and associated costs) as objective functions. To our knowledge, no such approach has been used so far for bed and costs management in finite capacity queuing systems.

The problem we wish to deal with in this paper is the optimization of the patient throughput in clinical departments and of the associated costs. It takes into account the use of some specific measurements, such as arrival rate, average length of stay, bed inventory, size of a possible waiting room, holding costs, etc. The components of the active healthcare service, such as short-term care, medium-term care, long-stay care, etc., depending on the clinical services provided by the hospital department, imply periods of time and resources. To deal with this complex problem, we converted the pattern of bed occupancy into the flow of patients through the clinical system. At the beginning, all patients are admitted into the hospital. It is noteworthy that they are not ‘homogeneous’, usually belonging to different categories. One group requires acute care, while others require medium or long-term rehabilitation. Accordingly, from acute care, they are either discharged back to community, or are transferred to the medium/long term care, from where they are discharged back or stay until death. We approached this system by means of queuing techniques, considering a compartmental model associated to different states (short-stay, medium-stay, etc.), and a mixed exponential distribution describing the average length of stay. The optimization of bed occupancy and associated costs, involving finding the optimal balance between bed inventory, holding costs and penalty costs, was addressed by the use of GAs.

Since a modern hospital/clinical department represents a complex system, we need to identify patterns within this complexity. Although there are a wide variety of patients with different diseases (e.g., geriatrics, surgical, stroke, etc.), the general context is similar enough, enabling the hope for a common approach regarding the flow.

Inspired by pharmacokinetics, which currently uses the multi-compartment model, the hospital/clinical department might be considered as a ‘body’ with different ‘organs’ (compartments). The number of transient patients thus represents the amount of drug [13]. Different from pharmacokinetics, where the tracking of an individual molecule of drug is measured by the total concentration of the drug in the organ, in the case of patient flow one can use the distribution of the patient length of stay.

While a one-compartment model assumes a similar treatment for all patients (e.g., acute care), two- and three-compartment models assume two and three different kinds of treatments (e.g., acute care and long-term rehabilitation). It is worth mentioning that there are situations better described by more than three compartments [8,14,15].

The mathematics behind the two-compartment model [13] can be briefly described as follows. Assume the clinical department has a constant admission rate A in equilibrium state, and let N
                        
                           i
                        (s), i
                        =1, 2 be the number of patients in each compartment (A and B) with length of occupancy s (days). Let r
                        1 and r
                        2 be the rates of discharge from compartment A and B respectively, with the assumption that r
                        2
                        <
                        r
                        1; let v
                        1 be the rate of transfer from A to B. The model is described by the following equations:

                         depicts the two-compartment model.

When fitting compartment models to observations, one assumes that:
                           
                              a)
                              The admissions occur at random (i.e., Poisson arrivals), such an assumption being reasonable for a stable hospital system;

The models, either discrete-time deterministic or continuous-time stochastic, may be regarded as phase-type [16], with the number of components equaling the number of compartments. This distribution describes the time to absorption of a finite Markov chain in continuous time, when there is a single absorbing state and the stochastic process starts in a transient state.

A fruitful and feasible operation research (OR)-based approach for modeling clinical departments is inspired by multiple-server queuing models, where the servers are represented by hospital beds. Note that the queuing system is assumed in statistical equilibrium (steady-state), so that all the queuing characteristics refer to long-run measures of performance of the system.

The Erlang B queuing system (M/PH/c/c) can be considered as one of the simplest ways to model the department. In this model, patients arrive according to a Poisson process (M stands for Markov/memoryless), the service distribution is phase-type (PH stands for phase-type), where the number of phases equals the number of compartments; c represents the number of available beds with no waiting positions. Since there are no waiting positions, a patient finding upon arrival that all c beds are occupied is lost for the system. Mathematically, λ denotes the Poisson arrival rate, the (hospital) length of stay (LoS) is phase-type with the probability density function:

                           τ represents the average number of arrivals during an average LoS, also known as offered load 
                           [17,18].

An excess of demand over supply causes waiting times. The elimination of waiting times in the public healthcare system is practically impossible. Since public healthcare services are, in principle, free, the waiting lists are unavoidable, becoming a practical tool for rationing demands and prioritizing supply. Hospital waiting lists are a major concern for the national health services, which cannot be solved just by a simple queuing model [19]. A beneficial and reasonable, at the same time, approach to solve this situation is a model using extra/back-up beds. The number of available beds depends on both the hospital bed capacity and the number of nurses/physicians on duty, and it is unreasonable to add only supplementary beds. This situation involves costs referring to both unoccupied beds and corresponding medical staff. Under these circumstances, one can extend the “loss” model by considering the possibility of estimating the provision of supplementary (unstaffed/back-up) beds to act as a temporary buffer at times of increased demand. Thus, the patients are admitted directly to whatever bed is available. These supplementary beds would be used only at times of crisis.

From the queuing theory point of view, the M/PH/c/N model can reasonably describe the underlying queuing system, considering the supplementary beds as a “waiting room/ward”. In such a system, the number c of servers (beds) is fixed, N
                           ≥
                           c denotes the maximum capacity of the system, and the waiting room has a maximum of (N
                           −
                           c) beds available. A limit of N patients is allowed, and a patient finding upon arrival N other patients in the system is turned away. This model represents a generalization of the “loss” system, with N
                           =
                           c.

A main concern when proposing a model to support healthcare decision-making is to find the trade-off between the best possible service to patients and a maximum utilization of resources (i.e., beds). By adding costs to the queuing model, we may determine the expenditure involved in treating patients, and thus the hospital planners may identify cost-effective strategies. We used a base-stock policy borrowed from the inventory theory [12] to determine an (near) optimal cost strategy. In this paradigm, we try to identify the trade-off between holding costs of (expensive) inventory items and penalty costs if a demand is left unsatisfied. The costs are associated with the stock policy and with the penalty for refusing patients. Two types of holding costs are envisaged, similar to the inventory problem. For each idle/unused-staffed bed, a cost of φ monetary units per day is considered. A different cost of ψ monetary units per day for each idle/unused back-up bed is taken into consideration. On the other hand, for each patient that is turned away (lost demand) a fix penalty cost of π monetary units is incurred. Among all costs incurred by the healthcare provider, we are interested in the holding costs and penalty cost only. Totaling the above costs, we obtain the average cost per day incurred by a clinical department (hospital), given by:

                        Remark. It is in the same way in which the parameters c and N are chosen by hospitals, according to their capacity limitation, that the values for the holding and penalty costs are determined according to the hospitals scale. Taking into account the difference between the staffed beds, for which staff is on hand to the patient occupying the bed, and the back-up/unstaffed beds, with no current staff, the (staffed) holding cost φ is larger than the (unstaffed) holding cost ψ. The difference between them depends on the hospital policy.

The goal of the paper is to optimize hospital bed occupancy and associated costs for a publicly funded healthcare service, in other words, to find the optimal balance between inventory costs (keeping a minimum number of empty beds to meet demands), and penalty costs (avoiding having to turn away patients). Focusing on the cost function g and rejection probability P
                        
                           N
                        , the issue of improving the inventory level/resource utilization is equivalent to an optimization problem. Concretely, the optimization of the inventory level/resource utilization consists of finding the best possible values of the parameters λ, τ, c, N, π, φ, and ψ from all feasible choices, in order to minimize the cost function g and the rejection probability P
                        
                           N
                        , depending on different tolerable thresholds generally accepted by practitioners.

To locate extreme values of a function is one of the basic objectives of mathematical optimization (continuous or discrete). Calculus is a widely used mathematical tool to figure out when a function of continuous argument takes on a local or global extreme value, while the discrete optimization represents a traditional alternative for the discrete argument case. Different from the mathematical approach, we proposed the use of the evolutionary paradigm, taking into account:
                           
                              •
                              The diverse nature of arguments – both discrete (c and N), and continuous {λ, τ, π, φ, ψ};

The effectiveness of GAs as heuristic searching tools not requiring the functions to be continuous or differentiable, and encoding through chromosomes the entire information (queuing and cost models parameters).

The parameters defining the queuing system along with the associated cost model generally belong to two different categories from the point of view of the control exercised upon them by the hospital management. Thus, there are parameters the healthcare professional cannot change, such as the arrival rate or the mean service time/length of stay. This kind of parameters may be considered as “objective” parameters. The other types of parameters that can be changed by the healthcare professionals in some circumstances are seen as “subjective” parameters. Summarizing, hereinafter we will deal with the “objective” parameters λ, τ, and with the “subjective” parameters c, N, π, φ, ψ. However, it is noteworthy that even the “objective” parameters may change in some circumstances. Thus, the arrival rate can be influenced by external factors (e.g., demographics, epidemiology, perceptions, etc.), while the length of stay can significantly differ for different patients with the same disease. Moreover, the maximum capacity of the system N may be subject to choice/change in some circumstances.

Computer-based optimization of both patient flow and hospital resource utilization represents a major challenge in patient management using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The task of finding an optimum balance between the number of beds (both occupied and ready for use) and the best health service can be approached by using GAs, seen as optimization algorithms [21].

GAs represent stochastic algorithms modeled after the biological processes of life, reproduction and death. The following features characterize them: populations of chromosomes, selection according to fitness, crossover to produce new offspring, and random mutation of new offspring. At the beginning, a large population of random chromosomes is created. They contain all the information about the potential candidates for an optimization problem. A cost function is evaluated at each iteration for all the existing chromosomes and the best of them are kept. Then, they are mated with each other to replenish the population, and the cost function is evaluated again. Some of them are deliberately mutated to help in getting the search out of local minima/maxima. The chromosomes are again evaluated for fitness, and the process is repeated until a termination criterion is met.

For the GA-based optimization, we implemented a standard GA [22,23] in Java. The efficiency of GA is greatly dependent on its tuning parameters. The choice is between ‘standard’ parameter settings (e.g., De Jong, Grefenstette) or customized settings for the specific problem. With these thoughts in mind, we considered the following parameter setting, which proved to be feasible, allowing a relative quick convergence (flat improvement curve):
                           
                              -
                              Using a heuristic evaluation, with population sizes ranging from 20 to 200 chromosomes, the best performance has been obtained for n
                                 =100 chromosomes.

The whole (total) arithmetic recombination (crossover rate p
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                                 =0.35 and parameter α
                                 =0.3), and the non-uniform (normally distributed) mutation (mutation rate p
                                 
                                    m
                                 
                                 =0.4) have been used.

Using a heuristic evaluation, with the number of generations ranging from 20 to 200, the manual inspection of the values of the corresponding fitness functions (either P
                                 
                                    N
                                  or g) indicated that 100 is the (near) optimal value.

We considered, for the sake of simplicity, intervals with 30% deviation around the mean as default search spaces for the chromosomes encoding the queuing model parameters; the same rule applies to the associated healthcare costs. Note that the distributions of the queuing parameters are not Gaussian (number of allocated beds, arrival rate, phase-type service), and the healthcare costs depend on the hospital administration.

Based on the ‘no guarantees to reach an optimum’ feature of GAs, a pre-determined level equaling 100 fitness evaluations has been considered as termination condition, also supported by a manual inspection indicating no significant fitness improvement.

The optimization problem refers both to the rejection probability and to the cost function. Firstly, we wish to determine the optimal values of the parameters defining the rejection probability given by (7) in order to achieve a probability of lost demands of no more than a pre-specified threshold (i.e., a maximum acceptable rejection). Secondly, we are interested in evaluating the optimal values of the parameters defining the cost function g, given by (8), in order to minimize it. The envisaged optimization process is two-fold:
                           
                              (a)
                              To estimate an acceptable threshold for the long-run fraction of rejected arrivals P
                                 
                                    N
                                  depending either on the number c of beds and the maximum system capacity N, or on all the queuing parameters (c, λ, τ);

To minimize the cost function g by controlling the “subjective” parameters c, π, φ, and ψ.

Accordingly, in the first case we consider the rejection probability P
                        
                           N
                         as fitness function, while in the second case the cost function g is the fitness function. Next, in the first case, a chromosome is represented either by a single gene c, or by a vector (c, λ, τ). In the second case, a chromosome is represented by a vector (c, λ, τ, φ, ψ, π).

It is noteworthy that the model described in this paper can be implemented using freely available software (e.g., Java, R programming language, ECJ (ECLab – George Mason University) (http://cs.gmu.edu/∼eclab/projects/ecj/), etc.), or a classical software package (e.g., MATLAB/GA Solver).

The methodology presented above is illustrated using bed-occupancy data collected at the Department of Geriatric Medicine – St. George's Hospital, London, period 1969–1984 [24], and January 2000 [25]. It can be adapted to different medical departments, such as surgery, stroke, mental illness, etc. Although the underlying paradigm is the same, when adapting the model to different medical departments, the practitioners have to anticipate the specific patient flow pattern, characterized by different values of the corresponding parameters and specific cost function components.

                              1.
                              According to the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey of Hospitals [26] 
                                 http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2010/104.pdf; http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2010/113.pdf [accessed 19.10.15], the corresponding queuing model parameters referring to surgery were estimated as λ
                                 =16.14 patients per day, τ
                                 =5.5 days, and c
                                 =150 beds, corresponding to community hospitals. This system envisages the post anesthesia care unit/surgical ward, seen as a one-compartment model.

The stroke data originate from the UK's Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database and concerns stroke patients [27,28]. The corresponding parameters were estimated as λ
                                 =286.2 patients per day, τ
                                 =14.29 days, and c
                                 =5587 beds, modeled as a three-compartment system.

The mental health data originate from the Center for Mental Health Policy and Services Research (CMHPSR), Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania (Medicaid) [29]. The corresponding model parameters were estimated as λ
                                 =1.907 patients per day, τ
                                 =1151 days, and c
                                 =562 beds, seen as a three-compartment system.

The healthcare assistance in the Department of Geriatric Medicine – St. George's Hospital, London, UK consisted of acute, rehabilitative, and long-stay medical service, corresponding to the three-compartment case. In the period of 15 years (1969–1984), a number of 7217 people with an average age of 81 years were inpatients (70% female and 30% male). Different causes (e.g., economic pressure, influenza epidemic in the 1970s, etc.) led to changes in the bed allocation, annual admission and mean length of stay. Based on the collected data, the steady-state geriatric department is well described by an average number of 186 beds per year, a mean arrival rate equaling λ
                        =5.9 patients per day, and a mean length of stay equaling τ
                        =24.9 days.

The inpatient hospital costs nowadays represent the largest component of healthcare expenditures in most developed countries. The inpatient costs are far from being uniformly and undoubtedly assessed. For a purely informative purpose, we mention that the average hospital adjusted expenses per inpatient day was $1730 throughout USA, and £225 in UK [30] 
                           http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/expenses-per-inpatient-day/ [accessed 19.10.15], [31] 
                           http://www.institute.nhs.uk/ [accessed 19.10.15]. Beyond the statistics, the actual inpatient costs are estimated by each hospital. While the cost function g may be used as it is, the parameters π, φ, and ψ are specifically chosen by each administrator according to the given situation.

To assess the effectiveness of the cost model, we have considered the estimated parameters related to a geriatric department as follows [10,11]:
                              
                                 (a)
                                 The total cost per patient per day is £168, where £50 are incurred with respect to the bed, and £118 with respect to the treatment;

The holding cost for idle staffed beds was estimated as φ
                                    =£50 per day;

The holding cost for idle back-up beds was estimated as ψ
                                    =£15, other approaches being possible taking into account the specific situation of a certain hospital;

The penalty cost is π
                                    =168×24.9×0.25=£1046, assuming that the total cost of turning away a patient may equal the cost per day multiplied by the expected length of stay, and the penalty cost represents 25% of the total cost of turning away a patient.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The experimental results take into account the following two aspects:
                        
                           •
                           The evolutionary-based optimization used to provide an efficacious management of bed occupancy and resources utilization of the finite capacity model;

A “What-if analysis” focused on:
                                 
                                    (a)
                                    The comparison of the alternative queuing models (“loss” and finite capacity), exploring the effects on the outcomes of both models by systematic changes in the input parameters:

An “indifference curve” analysis regarding circumstances in which we are indifferent between neighboring values of the bed inventory and average number of patients in system vis-à-vis the rejection probability and cost function.

The methodology is illustrated using bed-occupancy data collected at the Department of Geriatric Medicine – St. George's Hospital, London, UK, as described above. The default search spaces for the chromosomes encoding the queuing model parameters are the following:

The number of allocated beds c
                              ∈[130, 240],

The arrival rate λ
                              ∈[4, 8],

The length of stay τ
                              ∈[17, 32],

Similarly, the default search spaces for the chromosomes encoding the healthcare costs are:
                        
                           •
                           
                              φ
                              ∈[35, 65],


                              π
                              ∈[732, 1360],


                     Remark
                     
                        
                           1.
                           The reason for choosing the default search space for c is based on the potential fluctuations that occur over time, although bed allocation (both in facilities and equipped staff) in a hospital is usually determined by its scale. The respective interval was selected large enough to cover possible fluctuations, although there is not a well-defined standard size for it. Two examples illustrate changes in bed allocation regarding geriatric medicine and general medicine in UK and New Zealand [24]. For instance, due to the 1978 economic pressures, at St. George's Geriatric Medicine, London, UK, the 40 regular beds and the 14 extra beds were replaced by 10 regular beds, and 12 extra beds. Although general medicine benefits of a greater flexibility as regards bed stock than geriatric medicine, there are changes of bed allocation. For instance, at Dunedin Hospital, New Zealand, instead of 41 needed beds, only 32 were provided.

Bed occupancy about 95% implies for most facilities to be considered fully occupied, while if 100% of the beds are filled then the system is in real crisis [32] 
                              http://www.longtermcarelink.net/eldercare/nursing_home.htm (Accessed: 19 October 2015). Under these circumstances, adding extra 5% back-up beds is intended to reduce the pressure under the hospital, the system becoming fully functional.

Since the costs involved in healthcare depend from hospital to hospital, and, generally, from state to state and region to region [30–32], we considered a relatively large interval for the associated costs in order to obtain a wide ‘picture’ concerning the feasible choices at hand.

The aim of the GA-based optimization is to minimize the objective (fitness) function P
                        
                           N
                         depending on different constraints regarding its range of values. Recall that there is no consensus among practitioners regarding what qualifies a certain percentage of lost demands as a tolerable level in geriatric medicine, but it suggests that running with percentage occupancy above eighties leads to significant increases in rejection of patients [33]. Accordingly, we considered a maximum rejection tolerable level equaling 15%, and a percentage of bed-occupancy ρ ranging from 63% to 97%. On the other hand, GA was used to find an optimal value for the fitness function g depending on different choices regarding both the holding costs and the penalty cost.

The first task of this experiment is to optimize the bed management by estimating the sufficient number of beds in order to maintain the number of rejected requests at a tolerable level. Consequently, the fitness function is represented by the rejection probability P
                           
                              N
                           , a chromosome consists of a single gene represented by the ‘subjective’ parameter c, while the other queuing ‘objective’ parameters λ, and τ are set to the default values (5.9, 24.9). Table 1
                            illustrates some results of the GA-based approach used to optimize the bed management, by presenting values of the rejection probability P
                           
                              N
                            in ascending order as function of different values of the ‘subjective’ parameter c, along with the corresponding bed-occupancy. Recall that these values are obtained with the population size n
                           =100 chromosomes and after 100 generations.

The evolutionary-based approach revealed that an ‘ideal’ rejection meaning ‘no patient being turned away’ (P
                           
                              N
                           
                           =0%) can be achieved with 194 beds plus 10 extra beds in the “waiting room”, but with a bed-occupancy equaling around 76%, below a relatively acceptable percentage of 85%. If bed-occupancy exceeds the threshold of 91%, which, from an economical standpoint, could be considered efficient, a rejection equaling around 1.1% can be carried out with 159 beds plus 8 unstaffed beds. It is noteworthy to observe that this potential managing performance involving 159 effective beds (167 totally) only, which is much lower than the geriatrics standard of 186 beds, has been obtained using the GA-based approach.

Afterward, we consider the situation in which all queuing system parameters c, λ and τ have the same nature, i.e., there is no longer distinction between ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’ characteristics. Consequently, the fitness function is represented by the rejection probability P
                           
                              N
                           , and a chromosome is represented by a vector (c, λ, τ). This approach, normal from the optimization point of view, can be considered fictitious from a real-world perspective, because it is very difficult to imagine hospital managers modifying the arrivals or treatment period at will. However, from both theoretical and experimental point of view, such a situation deserves to be explored and simulated, providing tools to improve healthcare by experimentally juggling the number of beds, arrivals, and length of stay, according to different possible scenarios. Table 2
                            illustrates the results of the GA-based optimization approach by showing some values of the rejection probability P
                           
                              N
                           , along with the corresponding bed-occupancy percentage, as function of different values of the queuing system parameters c, λ, and τ.

The GA-based optimization has revealed that the ‘ideal’ scenario with no refused patient (P
                           
                              N
                           
                           =0) can be achieved in different circumstances regarding the queuing parameters. However, effective strategies must be suitable, feasible, and acceptable to all stakeholders (patients, firstly, and hospitals managers, secondly). Three factors matter, as resulting from a hospital long-run experience: (a) suitable number of beds, (b) convenient rejection probability, and (c) efficient bed-occupancy percentage. It resulted that an inventory of 180 allocated beds, with a supply of 10 unstaffed beds, in conjunction with arrival rate equaling 6.43 patient/day, and mean length of stay of 24.9 days can be seen as a feasible choice (P
                           
                              N
                           
                           =0.27%) for a geriatric department in accordance with the default conditions (c
                           =186 beds and τ
                           =24.9 days). It is noteworthy to observe that, as opposed to the standard geriatric department, this simulation revealed a smaller number of effective beds (180 vs. 186), although the arrival rate can increase from 5.9 up to 6.43 patient/day.


                           Remark. The selection of values in Tables 1 and 2 was purely illustrative, the GA optimization providing values of either the parameter c, or all the queuing parameters c, λ, and τ, for different thresholds of the rejection probability P
                           
                              N
                           , chosen by potential users.

The second task of the experiment is to optimize the corresponding healthcare costs, thus facilitating an efficient access to medical service. The GA-based approach aimed to estimate the (near) optimum values of the parameters c, λ, τ, φ, ψ and π in order to maintain at a minimum feasible level the cost (objective) function g, but with a reasonable proportion of patients turned away. In this context, a chromosome is represented by a vector (c, λ, τ, φ, ψ, π), while the fitness function is now represented by the cost function g. Table 3
                            presents some values of the cost function g as functions of different values of the ‘subjective’ parameter c, and associated costs φ, ψ, and π, along with the corresponding percentage of rejected patients P
                           
                              N
                            in descending order. The ‘objective’ parameters λ, τ (constant) have been set according to the default values in a geriatric department. Let us remark that, as in the bed allocation case, the selection of values was purely illustrative, the GA optimization providing values of the involved parameters for different thresholds of the cost function g, chosen by potential users.

As shown in Table 3, there are a wide variety of choices regarding the ‘subjective’ parameters, namely the bed allocation, the costs related to the inactivity of both staffed and unstaffed beds, and the penalty cost of rejecting patients, resulting in very different average costs g. Analyzing the results presented in Table 3, we can see that:
                              
                                 •
                                 The same bed allocation (c
                                    =141, N
                                    =148), implying the same rejection probability P
                                    
                                       N
                                    
                                    =7.18%, will require significantly different average costs g (£951 vs. £527), for significantly different holding and penalty costs (£60 vs. £35, £18 vs. £11, and £1360 vs. £720) – columns 2 and 3;

The same holding and penalty costs, but significantly different bed allocations (156 vs. 184, 164 vs. 193 respectively), will result in significantly different costs (£755 vs. £1172), but with increased healthcare quality, measured by the significantly lower rejection probability – columns 4 and 5;

Improved bed allocation (192 vs. 134, 202 vs. 141 respectively), correlated with lower costs (£40 vs. £60, £12 vs. £18, and £970 vs. £1240), will result in a significant reduction of refused patients (126 times lower), saving, in addition, £66 – columns 6 and 7.

To conclude, depending on a predefined rejection threshold, the managers can simulate different scenarios regarding beds stock and afferent costs, eventually choosing the feasible optimum value of g.

Next, consider the general ‘fictitious’ situation in which all the queuing system parameters, whether they be ‘objective’ or ‘subjective’, and the related costs are changeable at will. Table 4
                            presents some values of the cost function g as functions of different values of the parameters c, N, λ, τ, φ, ψ and π, along with the corresponding percentage of rejected patients P
                           
                              N
                            in descending order.

We can extract interesting information by analyzing the results presented in Table 4:
                              
                                 •
                                 The same number of beds (c
                                    =144, N
                                    =151), the same costs -holding and penalty (φ
                                    =£50, ψ
                                    =£15, π
                                    =£1046) – but increasing arrival rates (6.09 vs. 5.04), and mean lengths of stay (28.70 vs. 25.76), will result in very different rejection probabilities (18.95% vs. 0.77%) and in different associated costs (£1423 vs. £905) – columns 2 and 3. Thus, a rejection probability of about 20 times higher leads to an increase in costs of £518, i.e., the rejection of patients is expensive;

If the bed allocation increases with 26 beds, from 166 to 192, with relatively minor differences regarding the arrival rate and length of stay (an increase of 0.75 patient per day and 0.4 days), it will lead to a decrease regarding the rejection probability from 14.17% to 0.09% (157 times smaller) – columns 4 and 5. In the same financial conditions, the increase in costs is just £121, but with a significant better healthcare service;

Same bed allocation (c
                                    =184, N
                                    =193), same costs (φ
                                    =£50, ψ
                                    =£15, π
                                    =£1046), but relatively minor differences regarding the arrival rate and length of stay (6.43 vs. 5.04, and 25.53 vs. 26.65), will result in reasonable differences between the rejection probabilities (0.34% vs. 0.00%) – columns 6 and 7. The costs, however, are very different, more than two times (£1172 vs. £2619), which has little economic justification with respect to the rejection probability (34 people out of 10,000 vs. no rejection).

The other results presented in Table 4 show other possibilities which may be considered by hospital management regarding the choice of the parameters c, N, λ, τ, φ, ψ and π, with respect to the rejection probability and the associated costs.

It is worth noting that the evolutionary-based experiment has revealed the extreme flexibility of the queuing system applied to bed management. Consequently, the manager can juggle the number of beds according to the given situation, and the allowed patient rejection level.

Apart from the bed-occupancy and resource optimization of the finite capacity queuing model, an additional “What-if” analysis explores different scenarios concerning various possible options available for the hospital management.


                           Fig. 2
                            illustrates the difference between the shapes of the long-run fraction of rejected arrivals corresponding to the two queuing models. For this experiment we consider a common beds stock c
                           =180 beds (N
                           =190), λ
                           ∈[2.5, 7.5], τ
                           ∈[14, 26] uniformly distributed.

As shown in the twin figures, the shapes resemble asymmetric “gorges” with significantly different depths and heights, as follows:
                              
                                 •
                                 
                                    P
                                    
                                       c
                                    
                                    =3.83E−33% (λ
                                    =3.82, τ
                                    =15.98), and P
                                    
                                       N
                                    
                                    =3.82E−45% (λ
                                    =3.05, τ
                                    =17.60);


                                    P
                                    
                                       c
                                    
                                    =0.374% (λ
                                    =6.17, τ
                                    =24.95), and P
                                    
                                       N
                                    
                                    =0.033% (λ
                                    =6.76, τ
                                    =22.25).

It is noteworthy to observe that the rejection probabilities computed for the default parameters values (λ
                           =5.9, τ
                           =24.9) are P
                           
                              c
                           
                           =0.374% and P
                           
                              N
                           
                           =0.007%.

Observe that, just as expected, the “loss” system is characterized by rejection probabilities higher than its alternative. Table 5
                            emphasizes the difference between the rejection probabilities P
                           
                              c
                            and P
                           
                              N
                            for some values of the arrival rate λ chosen around 5.9 patient/day.

It is noteworthy that, when λ increases, exceeding eight or more patient/day, the two probabilities tend to overlap (the corresponding ratio Pc/P
                           
                              N
                            tends to 1), as depicted in Fig. 3
                           .

This means that allocation of extra beds for an overloaded system is not enough anymore; other approaches have to be used in such circumstances.

Regarding the costs involved by the two queuing systems, Table 6
                            highlights the trend of the differences between costs associated to the two queuing systems for a bed allocation c
                           =180, and N
                           =189 beds, close to the default bed stock in a geriatric department. We calculated the costs g
                           
                              E
                            and g depending on the arrival rate λ only, while the average length of stay was kept constant (τ
                           =24.9, default value for geriatrics), since the healthcare professionals cannot choose to discharge patients at will. Instead, they need to wait until patients are ready in some sense (e.g., deemed to be stabilized (cured), or able to be transferred to some other form of care). The associated costs were set as default: penalty cost π
                           =£1046, and the holding costs φ
                           =£50, ψ
                           =£15. Although the underlying idea behind the cost functions is the same, the distinct paradigms underpinning them make the difference.

As seen from Table 6, there is a significant difference between the costs involved by the two systems, strongly depending on the arrival rate. For arrival rates ranging from 2 to 6 patients per day, there are not notable differences (about 135, on average). Once the arrival rate exceeds this threshold, the cost g associated to the finite capacity system becomes significantly smaller than g
                           
                              E
                            (associated to the “loss” system), as depicted in Fig. 4
                           . This result is in accordance with the real situation, because low arrival rates involve a relatively non-congested system. As the number of arriving patients increases, the system becomes crowded, involving the introduction of new (back-up) beds. Although it may seem paradoxical, the strategy to consider extra (unstaffed) beds leads to lower costs at the same time with maintaining a decent rejection probability, especially in periods when the hospitals are operating at near full capacity or above (e.g., in case of epidemics or after holidays).

Developed in economics, an indifference curve displays various combinations of two items yielding equal satisfaction. Inspired by this model, applied for inventory optimization [34] and hospital management [10], [21], we have used the paradigm in our experiment. We have explored the circumstances in which we are ‘indifferent’ between neighboring values of the control variables c and L vis-à-vis the rejection probability P
                           
                              N
                            and cost function g. Otherwise stated, we have sought combinations of the two parameters c and L providing nearly equal rejection and cost, respectively. It is noteworthy that the bundle of the two parameters may be considered as the ‘core’ of the associated queuing model. They bring together both the hospital (active) inventory c and the patient flow triplet features (arrival rate, length of stay and rejection probability), through the mean bed usage L. As associated costs, we have considered the default costs for a geriatric department (φ
                           =£50, ψ
                           =15, and π
                           =£1046). We have illustrated the “indifference” curves through two couples of 2-D graphics. Fig. 5
                            shows the ‘indifference’ to different choices of the number of beds c and the average number of patients in system L with respect to two values of the rejection probability P
                           
                              N
                            (0% and 10%).

The two graphs in Fig. 5 suggest that we may be indifferent to different choices regarding the number of beds and the mean bed usage so long as the rejection probability P
                           
                              N
                            preserves certain values, as for instance:
                              
                                 •
                                 A rejection probability P
                                    
                                       N
                                    
                                    ≈0% can be reached for different combinations of couples of number of beds c and average number of patients in system L ranging from 165 to 240, and from 105 to 165, respectively. The hospital manager can juggle, for instance, with choices of (c, L) such as (165, 163), (178, 140), (190, 134), etc., according to the hospital scale and resources.

A rejection probability P
                                    
                                       N
                                    
                                    ≈10% can be reached for different combinations of couples (c, L) ranging from 134 to 191, and from 105 to 165, respectively. Choices of number of beds and mean bed usage such as (134, 130), (161, 157), (172, 137), etc. can lead to a rejection probability around 10%.

On the other hand, Fig. 6
                            illustrates the ‘indifference’ with respect to different choices regarding the number of beds and the mean bed usage in relation to the associated costs.

The two graphs in Fig. 6 imply that we may be indifferent to different choices regarding the number of beds and the mean bed usage so long as the associated costs g preserves certain values, as for instance:
                              
                                 •
                                 A number of beds ranging from 135 to 210 and an average number of patients in system ranging from 120 to 210 yield associated costs g around £1000. Thus, choices of number of beds and mean bed usage such as (135, 202), (156, 164), (191, 137), etc. can lead to the same cost of £1000.

Afferent costs g reaching approximately £2000 are associated with different combinations of couples of number of beds c and average number of patients in system L ranging from 130 to 240, and from 90 to 200, respectively. For instance, choices such as (135, 176), (178, 167), (195, 125) may be taken into consideration, when a cost of around £2000 is envisaged.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS@&#

There is much research in healthcare modeling proposing new interesting models. Different approaches originating in OR and AI techniques have brought a significant contribution to providing practical ways of managing patients in a more efficient manner. It is noteworthy to highlight the fact that such approaches are far from being directly used by hospital administrators, their main role being to offer decision-making support.

From a theoretical point of view, the hospitals administrators need at least: (a) to understand and evaluate the patient flow characteristics, the available inventory and financial resources, (b) to identify the actual possibilities of amending the bed-occupancy/resource parameters (e.g., length of stay, availability of unstaffed beds, costs per occupied/unstaffed bed, penalty costs, etc.), and (c) to estimate/forecast changes in the government healthcare philosophy regarding bed stock and financial support.

After the model is built, its implementation should encompass: (a) the analysis of the data records regarding the patient flow in order to estimate the queuing model parameters, (b) the analysis of the bed allocation history (constrains in bed stock, bed closure, bed crisis, etc.) allowing the use of different scenarios regarding the bed inventory, and (c) the analysis of the changes in the hospital management philosophy regarding the allocated budget.

Once these steps are completed, the model can be applied by testing different scenarios using optimization techniques through the “What-if analysis”. The intent of such an approach is to provide healthcare professionals with a supporting computer-aided tool to simulate different scenarios in order to decide what policies could be introduced with beneficial effect.

This paper explores the feasibility of applying such an approach, by using theoretical results, empirical knowledge achieved through long practice, and the adaptive heuristic search of the GA to support the hospital bed management and resource utilization. This approach aims at providing hospital managers with a supporting computer-aided tool enabling the decision optimization by simulating different scenarios regarding the values of both the ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ parameters involved in the model.

Starting from a standard M/PH/c/N finite capacity queuing model for bed-occupancy in hospitals, an evolutionary-based approach is proposed to optimize hospital management by providing an efficient way to estimate the control parameters in order to obtain a reasonable proportion of turned away patients, along with an (near) optimum number of beds (both staffed and unstaffed). In addition, a cost model was proposed, enabling the hospital management to balance the cost of idle staffed and back-up beds against the cost of turning patients away, thus facilitating a quality healthcare service with affordable costs.

To enhance the decision process, a “What-if” analysis has also been proposed. It enables the hospital manager to simulate several scenarios in order to make the (near) optimal decision depending on circumstances.

Based on a base-stock policy often used in inventory systems of expensive and slow-moving items, we have explored the circumstances in which we are indifferent between neighboring values of the number of beds and the average number of patients in system upon the proportion of lost demands and corresponding healthcare costs. Under these circumstances, the hospital manager can choose adequate bed-stock policies, suitable arrival rates, and lengths of stay along with corresponding costs in order to maintain proper medical care, by keeping the percentage of lost demands at a low level.

We have illustrated the methodology using bed-occupancy data based on the practice of the Department of Geriatric Medicine of St. George's Hospital, London, UK. The cost model was inspired by previous studies [10,11], this approach being meant to be indicative, actual costs depending only on the concerned hospital.

The idea of using the evolutionary paradigm to optimize the hospital inventory and corresponding healthcare is advantageous and handy in several aspects. Encoding the whole information provided by both the queuing system and the cost model through chromosomes, the GA algorithm represents an efficient tool in optimizing the bed allocation and associated costs. It is noteworthy to mention that, due to the flexibility of GAs, the optimization process is straightforward and the methodology can be adapted to a wide variety of possible scenarios.

Most importantly, the methodology can be extended to different medical departments, this approach providing a prototype mix model, both the queuing and the evolutionary components being ready to be applied to different circumstances with minor modifications in structure and parameterization.

It is noteworthy to mention that the main role of this heuristic approach is to offer decision-making support to healthcare professionals, the direct use by hospital administrators being difficult from a practical point of view.

Starting from this study, future work may carry forward the approach presented above. The standard GA algorithm could be engineered by adjusting its characteristics to different types of medical departments/hospitals, different types of patients/illnesses, different geographical regions. In addition, novel GA models, such as hybrid neural networks-GA algorithms, may be developed and applied to better suit the specific environment. The initial “What-if analysis” may be extended to cover a larger range of possible scenarios.
