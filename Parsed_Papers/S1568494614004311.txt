                     DS a file system, host based anomaly detection system that monitors Basic Security Module (BSM) audit records and determines whether a web server has been compromised by comparing monitored activity generated from the web server to a normal usage profile. Additionally, we propose a set of features extracted from file system specific BSM audit records, as well as an IDS that identifies attacks based on a decision engine that employs one-class classification using a moving window on incoming data. We have used two different machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and our evaluation is performed on real-world datasets collected from three web servers and a honeynet. Results are very promising, since FI

                     DS is evaluated for the web daemon user; nevertheless, it can be directly extended to model any daemon-user for both intrusion detection and postmortem analysis.
