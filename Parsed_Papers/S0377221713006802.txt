                  In this research, two crucial optimization problems of berth allocation and yard assignment in the context of bulk ports are studied. We discuss how these problems are interrelated and can be combined and solved as a single large scale optimization problem. More importantly we highlight the differences in operations between bulk ports and container terminals which highlights the need to devise specific solutions for bulk ports. The objective is to minimize the total service time of vessels berthing at the port. We propose an exact solution algorithm based on a branch and price framework to solve the integrated problem. In the proposed model, the master problem is formulated as a set-partitioning problem, and subproblems to identify columns with negative reduced costs are solved using mixed integer programming. To obtain sub-optimal solutions quickly, a metaheuristic approach based on critical-shaking neighborhood search is presented. The proposed algorithms are tested and validated through numerical experiments based on instances inspired from real bulk port data. The results indicate that the algorithms can be successfully used to solve instances containing up to 40 vessels within reasonable computational time.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Maritime transportation is a major channel of international trade. In the last decade, the shipping tonnage for dry bulk and liquid bulk cargo has risen by 52% and 48% respectively. The total volume of dry bulk cargoes loaded in 2008 stood at 5.4 billion tons, accounting for 66.3% of total world goods loaded UNCTAD (2009). The proper planning and management of port operations in view of the ever growing demand represents a big challenge. A bulk port terminal is a zone of the port where sea-freight docks on a berth and is stored in a buffer area called yard for loading, unloading or transshipment of cargo. In general, the bulk terminal managers are faced with the challenge of maximizing efficiency both along the quay side and the yard. From the past research, it is well established that operations research methods and techniques can be successfully used to optimize port operations and enhance terminal efficiency. However while significant contributions have been made in the field of large scale optimization for container terminals, relatively little attention has been directed to bulk port operations.

Bulk terminal operations planning can be divided into two decision levels depending on the time frame of decisions: tactical level and operational level. Tactical level decisions involve medium to short term decisions regarding resource allocation such as port equipment and labor, berth and yard management, and storage policies. In practice, these decisions could be based on “rules of thumb” in which the experience of the port managers plays an important role, or alternatively more scientific approaches based on operations research methods could be in use. The operational level involves making daily and real time decisions such as crane scheduling, yard equipment deployment and last minute changes in response to disruptions in the existing schedule. This paper focuses on the tactical level decision planning for the integrated berth and yard management in the context of bulk ports. We focus in particular on two crucial optimization problems in the context of bulk port terminals: The Berth Allocation Problem (BAP) and the yard assignment problem.

The tactical berth allocation problem refers to the problem of assigning a set of vessels to a given berthing layout within a given time horizon. There could be several objectives such as the minimization of the service times of vessels, the minimization of the port stay time, the minimization of the number of rejected vessels, and the minimization of the deviation between actual and planned berthing schedules. There are several spatial and temporal constraints involved in the BAP, which lead to a multitude of BAP formulations. The temporal attributes include the vessel arrival process, the start of service, the handling times of vessels, while the spatial attributes relate to the berth layout, the draft restrictions and others. In a container terminal, all cargo is packed into containers, and thus there is no need for any specialized equipment to handle any particular type of cargo. In contrast, in bulk ports, depending on the vessel requirements and cargo properties, a wide variety of equipment is used for discharging or loading operations. Thus, the cargo type on the vessel needs to be explicitly taken into consideration while modeling the berth allocation problem in bulk ports. The tactical yard assignment problem refers to decisions that concern the storage location and the routing of materials. This affects the travel distance between the assigned berth to the vessel and storage location of the cargo type of the vessel on the yard, and furthermore determines the storage efficiency of the yard. Thus, the problems of berth allocation and yard management are interrelated. The start and end times of vessel operations determine the workload distribution and the deployment of yard equipment such as loading shovels and wheel loaders in the yard side. Moreover, berthing locations of vessels determine the storage locations of specific cargo types to specific yard locations, which minimize the total travel distance between the assigned berthing positions to the vessels and the yard locations storing the cargo type for the vessel. Similarly, the yard assignment of specific cargo types has an impact on the best berthing assignment for vessels berthing at the port. In this study, we present an integrated model for the dynamic, integrated berth allocation problem and yard assignment in the context of bulk ports. Few scholars have investigated this problem in the context of container terminals, and there is no published literature for bulk ports. We present an exact solution algorithm based on branch-and-price and a metaheuristic approach based on critical-shaking neighborhood search to solve the combined large scale problem. Numerical experiments based on real-life-inspired port data indicate that the proposed algorithms can be successfully used to solve even large instances.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

From the past OR literature on container terminal operations, it is well established that integrated planning of operations can allow port terminals to reduce congestion, lower delay costs and enhance efficiency. Significant contribution has been made in the field of large scale optimization and integrated planning of operations in container terminals. Bulk ports on the other hand have received almost no attention in the operations research literature. The integrated berth allocation and quay crane assignment or scheduling problem has been studied in the past by Park and Kim (2003), Meisel and Bierwirth (2006), Imai, Chen, Nishimura, and Papadimitriou (2008), Meisel and Bierwirth (2009), and more recently by Giallombardo, Moccia, Salani, and Vacca (2010) and Vacca (2011) for container terminals. Comprehensive literature surveys on container terminal operations can be found in Steenken, Voss, and Stahlbock (2004), Stahlbock and Voss (2008), and Bierwirth and Meisel (2010).

The dynamic, hybrid berth allocation problem in the context of bulk ports is studied by Umang, Bierlaire, and Vacca (2013). The berth allocation problem in container terminals has been widely studied in the past. Imai, Nagaiwa, and Chan (1997), Imai, Nishimura, and Papadimitriou (2001, 2003, 2008), Monaco and Sammarra (2007), Buhrkal, Zuglian, Ropke, Larsen, and Lusby (2011), Zhou and Kang (2008), Han, Lu, and Xi (2010), Cordeau, Laporte, Legato, and Moccia (2005), Mauri, Oliveira, and Lorena (2008) propose methods to solve the discrete berth allocation problem. The continuous berth allocation problem is studied by Li, Cai, and Lee (1998), Guan, Xiao, Cheung, and Li (2002), Park and Kim (2003), Guan and Cheung (2004), Park and Kim (2002), Kim and Moon (2003), Lim (1998), Tong, Lau, and Lim (1999), Imai, Sun, Nishimura, and Papadimitriou (2005) and Chang, Yan, Chen, and Jiang (2008). The berth allocation problem with hybrid layout is addressed by Moorthy and Teo (2006), Dai, Lin, Moorthy, and Teo (2008), Nishimura, Imai, and Papadimitriou (2001) and Cheong, Tan, Liu, and Lin (2010), and position-dependent handling times are considered by Cordeau et al. (2005) and Imai, Nishimura, Hattori, and Papadimitriou (2007) for indented berths.

Yard management in container terminals involves several tactical and operational level decision problems. Scheduling and deployment of yard cranes is addressed by Cheung, Li, and Lin (2002), Zhang, Wan, Liu, and Linn (2002), Ng and Mak (2005), Ng (2005) and Jung and Kim (2006). Storage and space allocation, stacking and re-marshalling strategies have been studied by Kim and Kim (1999), Kim, Lee, and Hwang (2003), Lee, Chew, Tan, and Han (2006) and few others. Nishimura, Imai, and Papadimitriou (2009) investigate the storage plan for transshipment hubs, and propose an optimization model to minimize the sum of the waiting time of feeders and the handling times for transshipment containers flow. Transfer operations that consist of routing and scheduling of internal trucks, straddle carriers and AGV’s have been studied by Liu, Jula, Vukadinovic, and Ioannou (2004), Vis, de Koster, and Savelsbergh (2005), and Cheng, Sen, Natarajan, Teo, and Tan (2005) among others. Works on integrated problems related to yard management in container terminals include Bish, Leong, Li, Ng, and Simchi-Levi (2001) and Kozan and Preston (2006) who propose the integration of yard allocation and container transfers, whereas Chen, Lei, and Zhong (2007) and Lau and Zhao (2007) study the integrated scheduling of handling equipment in a container terminal. In the following, we discuss in more detail some articles relevant to our study.


                     Moorthy and Teo (2006) discuss the concepts of berth template and yard template in the context of transshipment hubs in container shipping. They study the delicate trade-off between the level of service as indicated by the vessel waiting times and the operational cost for moving containers between the yard and quay in a container terminal. A robust berth allocation plan is developed using the sequence pair approach, with the objective to minimize the total expected delays and connectivity cost that is related to the distance between the berthing positions of vessels belonging to the same transshipment group.


                     Cordeau, Gaudioso, Laporte, and Moccia (2007) study the Service Allocation Problem (SAP), a tactical problem arising in the yard management of Gioia Tauro Terminal. The SAP is a yard management problem that deals with dedicating specific areas of the yard and the quay to the services or route plans of shipping companies which are planned in order to match the demand for freight transportation. The objective of the SAP is the minimization of container rehandling operations in the yard and it is formulated as a Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP, see e.g. Cordeau, Gaudioso, Laporte, & Moccia (2006) and Hahn, Kim, Guignard, Smith, & Zhu (2008)). An evolutionary heuristic is developed to solve larger instances obtained from the real port data.


                     Zhen, Chew, and Lee (2011) propose a mixed integer model to simultaneously solve the tactical berth template and yard template planning in transshipment hubs. The objective is to minimize the sum of service cost derived from the violation of the vessels expected turnaround time intervals and the operation cost related to the route length of transshipment container flows in the yard. A heuristic algorithm is developed to solve large scale instances within reasonable time and numerical experiments are conducted on instances from real world data to validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

More recently, Lee and Jin (2013) study the feeder vessel management problem in a container transshipment hub. The integrated problem consists of three tactical decision problems of berth template, schedule template and yard template design. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer program and solved using a memetic heuristic based on genetic algorithm and tabu search. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by conducting numerical experiments on instances based on real port data.

To the best of our knowledge, operations research problems have received almost no attention thus far in the context of bulk port terminals. In the context of container terminals, the major focus in the field of large scale optimization has been on studying the integrated berth allocation and quay crane scheduling or assignment problem, while very few scholars have attempted to solve the combined problem of berth allocation and yard assignment as a single large scale optimization problem. This is also the first paper to present an exact solution algorithm (based on branch-and-price) to solve the integrated problem in context of seaside port operations planning. Moreover we discuss and emphasize the specific features in bulk port operations that necessitate the need to devise specific solutions for bulk terminals.

In this section we elaborate on the background for the integrated berth allocation and yard assignment problem in the context of bulk ports. A schematic representation of a bulk port terminal is shown in Fig. 1
                     . We consider a set of vessels N, to be berthed on a continuous quay of length L over a time horizon H. We consider dynamic vessel arrivals and a hybrid berth layout in which the quay boundary is discretized into a set M of sections of variable lengths. In a feasible berthing assignment, a given vessel may occupy more than one section, however a given section cannot be occupied by more than one vessel or part of a vessel at any given time. The dynamic, hybrid berth allocation problem in bulk ports is studied by Umang et al. (2013), in which two alternative exact solution methods and a heuristic approach are proposed to solve the problem. The problem is solved for a given yard layout and the unit handling times for given sections along the quay and cargo types are provided as input parameters to the model. In the present work, we extend the berth allocation problem to account for the assignment of yard locations to specific cargo types and vessels berthing at the port which also become decision variables in the integrated framework. Evidently the integrated problem is much more complex and extensive than the berth allocation problem studied in Umang et al. (2013). The integrated problem is solved for a given time frame, and the objective is to minimize the service times of the vessels berthing at the port.

A major difference between bulk port and container terminal operations is the need to explicitly account for the cargo type on the vessel in bulk ports. Depending on the vessel requirements and cargo types, a wide variety of specialized equipment such as conveyors and pipelines are used for discharging or loading operations. For example, liquid bulk is generally discharged using pipelines which are installed at only certain sections along the quay. Similarly, a vessel may require the conveyor facility to load cargo from a nearby factory outlet to the vessel. In contrast in a container terminal, all cargo is packed into containers, and thus there is no need for any specialized equipment to handle any particular type of cargo. Furthermore in bulk ports, depending on the cargo properties, there may be additional restrictions on the storage of specific cargo types in the yard which forbids two or more cargo types to be stored in adjacent yard locations to avoid intermixing.

In our model we assume a fixed crane deployment during the processing time of the vessel. Note that this assumption is consistent with our observations during our visit to the bulk port under study. It was observed that for certain cargo types, only conveyors and pipelines are used for the loading/discharging operations and the cranes are not used at all. For the vessels which do require the cranes for handling operations, the port ensures a fixed number of cranes to operate on the vessel during the handling time of the vessel, where the number of cranes is a function of the length of the vessel. This is partly made possible by the fact that the total number of cranes available at the port is significantly higher than the number of cranes handling the vessels at any given time, thus enabling the port to replace cranes in the unlikely event of breakdown or other mechanical problems. Moreover the cranes can move freely and pass each other as opposed to the cranes in container terminals that are restricted to movements by rail. Thus in our model, we do not explicitly include constraints on the scheduling or assignment of cranes, since the number of cranes operating on a given vessel can be determined by data preprocessing depending on the cargo type and the length of the vessel.

It is further assumed that each vessel has a single cargo type that can be discharged (loaded) and transferred to (from) multiple yard locations. The assumption of single cargo type on each berthing vessel is consistent with the data sample that we received from the port. Moreover to model multiple cargo types on the same vessel, the internal structure of each vessel needs to modeled more rigorously which is beyond the scope of this study, nor is typically considered in any studies related to berth allocation planning. The assumption that a given cargo type can be stored at several yard locations is true in practice. The cargo is stored at several yard locations to load (discharge) a single vessel, and moreover there are situations when more than one vessel with the same cargo type are being handled at different locations along the quay, in which case the same cargo type is stored at multiple locations on the yard as close to the berthed vessels as possible.

In the computation of the handling times, it is assumed that all sections occupied by the berthed vessel are being operated on simultaneously. The amount of cargo handled at each section is proportional to the length of the berthed section, and the handling time of the vessel is the time taken to load or discharge the section whose operation finishes last. We define the unit handling time of a vessel as the time taken to load (discharge) a unit quantity of cargo on (from) the vessel. The unit handling time of a vessel has a fixed component dependent on the number of quay cranes operating on the vessel, and a variable component which is dependent on the distance between the berthing location of the vessel and the storage location of the corresponding cargo type on the yard. Since a given cargo type can be discharged (loaded) and transferred to (from) multiple yard locations, the distance between the berthing location of the vessel and the storage location of the cargo type is the weighted average distance between the vessel and all the cargo locations that are assigned to the vessel. In this calculation, the weights are assumed equal to the cargo quantities that are transferred to (from) each yard location from (to) the vessel.

Another assumption in the model is that in the given planning horizon, a given yard location is either assigned to a single cargo type, or alternatively the yard location is not assigned to any cargo type. This assumption is realistic because in periods of low congestion at the port, there may be several yard locations that are not assigned to any cargo type. Even in periods of congestion, as a standard practice at the port, two different cargo types are never stored at the same yard location. The assumption that the assignment of a cargo type to a specific storage location on the yard does not alter during the planning horizon makes sense because in our model, the two problems of berth allocation and yard assignment are solved simultaneously for a given time frame. This implies that the integrated model tries to determine the optimal assignment of cargo types to yard locations for which the handling times of the vessels berthing in that planning horizon are minimized. In practice when the model is implemented in a rolling planning horizon, there is a considerable gap of at least a few days between two planning runs. In that case the assignment of cargo types on the yard will change depending on the cargo types on the vessels berthing in the next planning window.

Based on the preceding discussion, the unit handling time

                        w
                      depends on the rate of transfer of cargo type w. Thus for example, if a vessel is using the conveyor facility to load rock aggregates from the rock factory directly into the vessel, the parameter V
                     
                        w
                      is equal to the cargo transfer rate for the conveyor facility, and if there are no additional cranes operating on the vessel, the parameter

                      which is provided as an input parameter to the model is equal to zero. In practice, the fixed specialized equipment facilities such as conveyors and pipelines are dedicated to handling certain cargo types. For example, liquid bulk is transferred using pipelines, and rock aggregates are transferred using conveyor facility. Thus the specialized facilities are themselves modeled as cargo types in the proposed model. The objective of the integrated optimization model that we solve is to minimize the sum of the service times of all vessels, which includes the handling or processing times and the berthing delays for all vessels berthing at the port.

In this section, we present a mixed integer programming formulation for the integrated berth allocation and yard assignment problem in bulk ports.

The objective function (1) minimizes the total service time of all vessels, which is the sum of total delays and total handling time of vessels berthing at the port. Constraints (2) are the dynamic arrival constraints that ensure that vessels can be serviced only after their arrival. Constraints (3)–(5) are the non-overlapping restrictions for any two vessels berthing at the port. These ensure that while two vessels may be overlapping in space or in time, they cannot be simultaneously overlapping in both space and time. Note that the constraints (3) and (4) have been linearized by using a large positive constant B. Constraints (6)–(8) ensure that each vessel occupies only as many number of sections as determined by its length and the starting section occupied by the vessel. Constraints (9) ensure that the draft of the vessel does not exceed the draft of any occupied section.

Constraints (10) are used to determine the total handling time for any given vessel which is equal to the time taken to process the section occupied by the vessel whose operation finishes last. The variable component of the handling time for a given vessel i and given occupied section k is determined by the constraint (12), and is a function of the weighted average distance between section k and all cargo locations assigned to vessel i. The average distance is weighted over the cargo quantities transferred between each cargo location p assigned to vessel i and section k occupied by the vessel, and is determined by constraint (13). Constraints (11) determine the unit handling time of vessel i at a given section k, which is the sum of the fixed component dependent on the number of cranes operating on that section and the variable component of the handling time as discussed earlier. Constraints (14)–(16) state that the total cargo quantity to be loaded (discharged) is equal to the sum of the cargo quantities transferred from (to) all the cargo locations assigned to the vessel. Constraints (17) are capacity constraints to ensure that the amount of cargo transferred in a unit time does not exceed the maximum amount of cargo that can be handled as given by parameter R
                        
                           w
                         for cargo type w. Note that in case of specialized equipment facilities, the parameter R
                        
                           w
                         may refer to the conveyor speed or the flow rate through the pipeline; in other cases it may refer to the maximum rate of transfer of material between the quay side and the yard side that can be achieved by assigning auxiliary equipment such as loading shovels and wheel loaders.

Constraints (18) impose an upper bound on the maximum number of cargo locations that can be assigned to any single vessel. Constraints (19) ensure that two cargo types that cannot be stored together, for example coal and clay, are not assigned to adjacent yard locations. Constraints (20) state that a given cargo location at a given time can be used by at most one vessel to avoid a congestion. Constraints (21) state that the yard locations have dedicated cargo types, and a given yard location can be assigned to at most one cargo type. Constraints (22) ensure that a vessel is assigned to a yard location only if that yard location stores the cargo type on the vessel.

Constraints (23)–(25) control the values of the binary decision variable 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    ω
                                 
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                                 
                                    ip
                                 
                              
                           
                         which should take value equal to 1, if and only if both the binary variables ϕ
                        
                           ip
                         and θ
                        
                           it
                         are equal to 1. This implies that vessel i is handled at cargo location p at time t if and only if, cargo location p is assigned to vessel i and vessel i is being handled at time t. Similarly, constraints (26)–(28) contol the values of the binary decision variable θ
                        
                           it
                         which is equal to 1 at all time intervals between the starting time of the handling of the vessel and the finishing time of the handling operations, and 0 otherwise.

The mixed integer programming formulation of the integrated model is extremely complex and unwieldy, and could not be used to solve even small sized instances, as was validated by numerical experiments. Thus in the following section, we decompose the mixed integer model and formulate it as a set partitioning problem.

Let Ω be the set of feasible berthing assignments of all vessels berthing at the port in the given planning horizon. Note that a feasible assignment represents the assignment of a single vessel for a given set of section(s) for a specific time period, assigned to a set of specific cargo location(s) in the yard.

The objective function (35) minimizes the total service time of vessels berthing at the port. Constraints (36) ensure that there is exactly one feasible berthing assignment for each vessel in the optimal solution. Constraints (37) state that a given section at a given time can be occupied by at most one vessel. Constraints (38) and (39) state that a given cargo location on the yard can store at most one cargo type. Constraints (40) are identical to constraints (19) in the original formulation, ensuring that cargo types that cannot be stored together are not stored at adjacent locations in the yard. Constraints (41) ensure that at most one vessel can be handled at a cargo location at a given time to avoid congestion. Constraints (42) and (43) state that both the decision variables λ

The above formulation was tested for small instances inspired from real port data. However, the number of feasible assignments given by the size of Ω grows exponentially with the problem size. This in turn leads to an exponential growth in the computational time. Hence in order to avoid the “explosion” of the solution time, we propose to solve the linear programming relaxation of the above problem using column generation, as described in the next section.


                        
                           
                              
                           
                        
                     

In the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the set partitioning problem the domains of λ

                                    μ
                                 
                                 
                                    w
                                 
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                              
                           
                         are extended to [0,1]. Despite the large number of variables it is possible to solve LP relaxation using a column generation algorithm. In a column generation algorithm we maintain a restricted master problem that only considers a small subset Ω
                        1
                        ⊆
                        Ω of all the possible variables. New variables are added to Ω
                        1 until we can decide that no variable in Ω⧹Ω
                        1 can improve the solution that results from only using the variables in Ω
                        1.

In the first iteration of column generation, the RMP is solved using the set Ω
                        1 consisting of vessel assignments in the initial feasible solution provided by the Initial Solution Heuristic (Section 5.2.1). Thereafter, in each successive iteration of the column generation process, the following dual variables are passed to the subproblem for identifying feasible assignments with negative reduced cost:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 π
                                 
                                    i
                                  – dual variables corresponding to constraints (36),


                                 τ
                                 
                                    kt
                                  – dual variables corresponding to constraints (37),


                                 ξ
                                 
                                    pw
                                  – dual variables corresponding to constraints (38),


                                 γ
                                 
                                    pt
                                  – dual variables corresponding to constraints (41).

We do not need to consider the dual variables corresponding to constraints (39) and (40) since these constraints do not involve the λ
                        
                           a
                         variables and therefore the associated dual variables do not impact the reduced cost of the λ
                        
                           a
                         variables. Based on the dual variables from RMP, the subproblem generates new columns to enter the active pool of columns Ω
                        1 by calculating the most negative reduced cost column for each vessel separately in each iteration of the column generation process. When there are no columns with negative reduced cost for any subproblem to enter Ω
                        1, the column generation terminates.

The column generation in pseudocode can be seen in Lines (1)–(13) in Algorithm 1. For mathematical justification of column generation, please refer to Barnhart, Johnson, Nemhauser, Savelsbergh, and Vance (1998), Desaulniers et al. (2005) and Feillet (2010).


                           
                              
                                 
                              
                           
                        

In order to execute the column generation, an initial feasible solution is needed. Note that if the problem is infeasible, no dual variables are produced causing the column generation approach to fail. An Initial Solution Heuristic algorithm (Algorithm 2) is designed to extract an initial feasible solution to the master problem (another option is to generate artificial variables with high costs). The heuristic searches through the space of all feasible columns (C), where a column represents the assignment of a single vessel containing the following information:
                              
                                 •
                                 set of sections occupied by the vessel,

set of cargo locations in the yard assigned to the vessel (from this information related to the cargo types stored at specific yard locations can be derived),

time period for which the given set of section(s) and cargo location(s) in the yard are occupied by the vessel (from this information related to the berthing delay and the handling time of the vessel can be derived).

In each iteration of column generation, we solve ∣N∣ subproblems, one for each vessel i
                           ∈
                           N. In each subproblem, the objective is to identify the feasible assignment for that particular vessel with the most negative reduced cost to be added to the current pool of active columns Ω
                           1 in the restricted master problem. Note that the index i
                           ∈
                           N is removed from all decision variables and input parameters in the sub-problem, since it is solved separately for each vessel i
                           ∈

Constraints (46) ensure that vessels can be served after their arrival. Constraints (47) are used to determine the total handling time of the vessel. Constraints (48) state that each vessel has exactly one starting section. Constraints (49) state that the vessel should be berthed such that it does not extend beyond the length of the quay. Constraints (50) determine if a particular section is occupied by the vessel. Constraints (51) impose an upper bound on the number of cargo locations that can be assigned to a single vessel. Constraints (52) ensure that a vessel is assigned to a yard location only if that yard location stores the cargo type on the vessel. Constraints (53)–(55) state that the total cargo quantity to be loaded (discharged) is equal to the sum of the cargo quantities transferred from (to) all the cargo locations assigned to the vessel. Constraints (56) calculate the weighted average distance over cargo quantities and constraints (57) calculate the handling time for a given vessel and berthed section. Constraints (58)–(60) control the values of the binary decision variable θ

                              kt

                            are equal to 1. Similarly, constraints (62)–(64) control the values of the binary decision variable ψ
                           
                              pt
                            to ensure that they take value equal to 1 if and only if both ϕ
                           
                              p

                              t
                            are equal to 1.

Since the sub-problem is solved separately for each vessel, the complexity of the problem is significantly reduced compared to the original problem. Thus in the proposed algorithm, the sub-problems are solved using an MIP solver.

Since we solve the linear relaxation of the restricted master problem, the final solution obtained after the convergence of the column generation process is typically not an integer solution. In the “worst” case, the solution of the relaxed version of the restricted master problem provides a lower bound to the solution of the original problem and an integer solution can be obtained by applying the branch and bound algorithm (for more details on branch and bound, please refer to Hillier & Lieberman (2001)) to the obtained solution. However, this does not guarantee that we obtain the optimal integer solution to the original problem, since there might be a column that would price out favorably but is not present in the final pool of active columns Ω
                        1. Therefore to find the optimal solution, column generation has to be executed again at every node of the branch and bound tree (Barnhart et al., 1998).

The branching is held on the 2 decision variables: λ and μ. Since λ variables are not restricting the solution space dramatically, we branch first on the μ variables. Since μ variables restrict the cargo type stored in a given cargo location, several columns are discarded, hence the convergence of branch and bound is faster than with the restriction of λ variables. When the list of μ variables has been exhausted, i.e. there are no fractional μ variables, then we start branching on the λ variables.

Note that while branching, both the RMP and the subproblem(s) have to be modified by adding extra constraints. In RMP, when μ variables are set to 0 or 1 in a particular iteration, constraints enforcing the μ variables to take the same values are also added in each subproblem in that iteration. When λ
                        
                           a
                         is set to zero, it is ensured that the subproblem for the vessel i in assignment a does not generate that assignment, otherwise (when set to 1) there is no change.

The combination of column generation and branch and bound is called branch-and-price. The complete algorithm for branch-and-price can be seen in Algorithm 1.

The branch-and-price method has been designed to tackle computationally heavy problems and to achieve a tight bound (lower bound in case of minimization). The convergence of the method is very much dependent on how well the decomposition of the original problem is carried out. The recommended method is to decompose the model in a way such that the sub-problem has a block angular structure (see Alvelos (2005) and Desaulniers et al. (2005)), so that each subproblem can be solved independently of each other. In this study, each sub-problem is trying to find the berthing and yard assignment of a given vessel that has the most negative reduced cost for a given set of dual variables reported from the solution output of the restricted master problem in the last iteration. It is straightforward to see that the berthing schedule of one vessel (output of the specific sub-problem) solved separately, does not have any effect on the remaining sub-problems. Since the effect of dependency rises only in the master problem, block angular structure is achieved for our problem.

Since we have access to the Ω (from the generation of the initial solution), the first strategy considered was to solve the master problem on Ω
                     1, retreive dual variables and calculate reduced costs on Ω. However this method proved to be computationally heavy, hence not feasible.

Another acceleration strategy to speed up the rate of convergence of the column generation process is to retrieve more than one negative reduced cost columns per sub-problem. This is achieved via modification of the original formulation of the sub-problem(s). The objective function is removed (i.e. the problem has no objective, it is only searching for any feasible solution(s)), and instead the following constraint is inserted into the model:

The above constraint together with constraints (46)–(66) yield as solution any feasible assignment with reduced cost less than zero (∊ being a very small number, e.g. 0.00001). We then use CPLEX functions to access the solution pool, containing all the feasible columns. Moreover in our case, we restrict the size of this pool to the maximum of 40 columns.

There are many other techniques to improve the convergence of the column generation process such as stabilization of the dual variables (Pigatti & Poggi Uchoa, 2005) and dynamic constraint aggregation (Elhallaoui, Villeneuve, Soumis, & Desaulniers, 2005; Elhallaoui, Desaulniers, Metrane, & Soumis, 2008).

These methods are not universal and depend on the structure of the specific problem under study. We studied these two techniques for our problem, however the results did not look very promising and hence they have not been included in this paper. In the dual stabilization method, the basic assumption that the dual variables are oscillating is not fulfilled and hence it leads to the failure of the method, although it needs to be a smaller number of columns to finish the column generation process.

The dynamic constraint aggregation technique that we tested is based on the aggregation of constraints of the same class and same coefficient values in the restricted master problem. This technique did not speed up the convergence of the column generation process significantly (except in the case of large instances), though the upper bounds were found to be tighter. This can be attributed to the fact that most of the computation time needed for the convergence of the column generation process is the time taken to solve the sub-problems, while the computation time of the master problem is already very fast for smaller problem size.

To provide an alternative to the exact solution algorithm proposed earlier, and obtain sub-optimal solutions in small computation time, we now propose a metaheuristic to solve the integrated problem of berth allocation and yard assignment. In the existing literature, the proposed metaheuristic is called critical-shaking neighborhood search (CSNS). The method was initially proposed by Lim and Xu (2006) to solve the yard allocation problem. The CSNS is based on deriving a feasible solution from a sequence of vessels, and iteratively changing the sequence of vessels to improve the solution quality.

An initial feasible solution is obtained using the Initial Solution Heuristic described earlier. Based on the solution, a priority order for assigning vessels is obtained by assessing the service quality of each vessel, such that the worst performing vessel is ranked highest in the priority list followed by the second worst performing vessel and so on. The service quality of a vessel is based on the service time of the vessel in the solution. To prevent the algorithm from getting stuck at local minima, the priority rankings of the top few critical vessels (30 % in our implementation) are changed by swapping two randomly selected vessels. The new priority list obtained is then used to obtain a new solution using a construction heuristic that returns a feasible solution for a given priority order of vessels, as described in Algorithm 4. In the algorithm shown, Ω refers to the set of all feasible assignments and p denotes the priority sequence. In the construction process, the construction heuristic tries to find the best feasible assignment for the given vessel i in the sequence from the set of all feasible assignments Ω[i] for the vessel i, ensuring that the overall solution constructed thus far given by π remains feasible.

To avoid the risk of the algorithm getting trapped in a cycle, a taboo list containing all the priority sequences evaluated thus far is also maintained. This cycle of analyzing the solution, prioritizing the vessels, critical-shaking the priority sequence and constructing a new solution, is then repeated for a given maximum number of iterations. In our implementation, the algorithm is run for 1000 iterations, and the best solution generated is accepted as the final solution. The complete metaheuristic is described in Algorithm 3.
                        
                           
                        
                      
                     
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section we describe the test instances and provide results from the proposed branch-and-price and metaheuristic algorithms.

The proposed solution algorithms were run on an x64-bit Intel Core i7, (1.60gigahertz) using a 64-bit version of CPLEX 12.3. The algorithms were implemented in Java Programming language.

The test instances are based on a sample of data obtained from the SAQR port, Ras-Al-Khaimah, UAE, the biggest bulk port in the middle east. The data was provided for a time horizon of roughly 10days from 28th March to 6th April, 2011. It further provided information about the physical attributes of the vessels berthing at the port such as the draft and the length of the vessels, expected and actual times of berthing activities including the arrival times and the handling times of the vessels, and the cargo tonnage of the vessels. Based on our observations and notes during our visit to the port in the year 2010, and the data sample provided to us, we could get an estimate of the range of values for most input parameters in our integrated model for berth allocation and yard assignment. Thus given our limited access to real bulk port data, the test instances are designed to be as realistic as possible, to test and validate the effectiveness of the proposed exact algorithm.

Three sets of instances are designed for ∣N∣=10, ∣N∣=25 and ∣N∣=40 respectively. In terms of the level of congestion as determined by the inter-arrival times of the incoming vessels, three different types of scenarios are considered in each set of instances-congested, mildly congested and uncongested. In all test instances, the total quay length is 1600meters, and the vessel lengths lie in the range of 50–260meters as in SAQR. In practice, the time frame of the integrated decision problem of berth allocation and yard assignment is of the order of few days. In the computational study, we have tested instances for the planning horizon of 5days or 120hours.

In all the generated instances, the cargo quantities on the vessels vary between 1 and 15 cargo units, and five cargo types are considered-liquid bulk that needs the pipeline facility for discharging, rock aggregates that need the conveyor facility for loading the vessels and three other general dry cargo types-clay, coal and cement. The incompatible pair of cargo types that cannot be stored at adjacent locations in the yard are liquid bulk-clay, and rock-cement. The berthing layout along with the location of the fixed facilities such as conveyors and pipelines used in the instances is shown in Table 1
                        . As illustrated in Fig. 2
                        , there are 10 cargo locations in the yard, where location 1 has the pipeline facility and is hence designated for liquid cargo, likewise location 10 has the conveyor facility and is designated to the rock aggregates; while locations 2–9 are designated to other cargo types. As discussed in the paper, the assignment of the cargo types to the locations 2–9 are decision variables in the optimization problem we are solving. The value of the parameter T is based on the crane handling rate of 1000 tonnes per hour. The number of cranes operating in a given section is determined by the length of the section, assuming an additional crane for every 50 meters of section length. The parameter V
                        
                           w
                         which is a constant dependent on the rate of transfer of cargo is assumed to be equal to 1/1200hours per meter per unit cargo for the conveyor, 1/3600hours per meter per unit cargo for the pipeline and 1/600hours per meter per unit cargo for all other cargo types.

In Table 2
                           
                           , Tables 4 and 5
                           
                           , the results obtained from the column generation method for instances containing ∣N∣=10, 25 and 40 vessels respectively are shown. Note that the computation time shown in the table is the time taken to solve the LP relaxation of the master problem using column generation, while # iter indicates the number of iterations of the column generation process to converge to the solution of the LP relaxation. The final size of the active pool of columns is given by ∣Ω
                           1∣, while the total number of feasible assignments is given by ∣Ω∣. As discussed earlier, the solution value obtained from the column generation method provides a lower bound to the optimal solution of the original problem. The upper bound to the optimal solution is obtained by running the RMP with integer decision variables in the last stage of the column generation method.

In the tables shown, the optimality gap between the lower bound and the optimal solution is represented by gap1, whereas gap2 represents the optimality gap between the optimal solution and the upper bound. The total gap between the lower bound and the upper bound, represented by gap, is then simply the sum of gap1 and gap2.

As shown in Table 2, for ∣N∣=10 vessels, for instances 7 and 8, the optimal solution is obtained directly from the column generation method, and hence there is no need for running the branch and bound algorithm for these instances. For the 3rd instance, the computational time of the branch and bound algorithm explodes and the optimal solution remains unknown.

Note that because of the exponential increase in the time complexity of the branch and bound algorithm with increase in the instance size, the branch and bound algorithm is executed for only instances containing ∣N∣=10 vessels. The results are as shown in Table 3, strongly indicating that branching on the μ variables is sufficient in almost all cases. Note that for instances containing ∣N∣=25, 40 vessels, the total optimality gap is still small, and thus we do not execute the branch and bound algorithm and save on the computational time. In these cases, the upper bound is accepted as the final sub-optimal solution to our problem.

Overall from the results of the column generation shown in Tables 2, 4 and 5, we can observe the following: barring a few exceptions, the computational time increases with the level of congestion, as well as with the final size of the active pool of columns and the number of iterations of the column generation process. On the other hand, the total optimality gap represented in the tables, is smaller for the instances with higher level of congestion. This can be attributed to the fact that the total number of feasible solutions is smaller for congested scenarios.

The solution results obtained from the proposed CSNS metaheuristic are shown in Tables 6–8
                           
                           
                            for ∣N∣=10, 25 and 40 vessels respectively. The results are compared with the upper bounds on the optimal solutions obtained from the branch-and-price algorithm. The CSNS and branch-and-price solutions are represented by ub1 and ub2 respectively in the tables shown. It can be seen that the percentage gap between the two solution values, increases with increase in the instance size. However, the solution gap averaged over all tested instances is less than 18%. Moreover, it is important to note that while the solution gap may be relatively large for few instances, the computation time for all tested instances is less than a minute. Thus in practice, the planner may be faced with the choice of solving large problem size to near optimality in order of few hours of computation time using the branch-and-price algorithm proposed earlier, or obtain reasonably good solutions as quickly as possible using the proposed metaheuristic.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

In this research, we study the integrated problem of berth allocation and yard assignment in context of bulk ports. In the past, few scholars have attempted to study the berth allocation problem in integration with the yard assignment problem in the context of container terminals, while in the context of bulk ports the problem has not been studied at all. The specific issues in bulk port operations that necessitate the need to devise specific solutions for bulk ports are emphasized in this study. An exact solution algorithm based on branch-and-price and a metaheuristic based on critical-shaking neighborhood search are proposed to solve the large scale integrated problem of berth allocation and yard assignment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that proposes an exact solution method to solve the large scale problem in the context of port operations planning, since all the previous studies in the context of container terminals use only metaheuristic methods to solve the problem.

The mathematical formulation of the integrated berth allocation and yard assignment problem is complex and extensive, however there is still scope for improvement. An important assumption in our model is that each vessel carries only a single type of cargo. In order to model and solve the problem for multiple cargo types, the location of each cargo type on the vessel needs to be explicitly modeled which would require the modification of some of the existing constraints in the current formulation as well as addition of some new constraints. Another possible extension of the current work is to account for the uncertainty in arrival times of the vessels and delays in handling operations due to factors such as breakdown of handling equipment including conveyors and pipelines and/or mobile harbor cranes. In the proposed exact solution method, the major source of the time complexity has been identified as the solution of the sub-problems in the column generation framework. Thus it may be worth investigating the reduction in the solution time of the sub-problems by using heuristic methods such as dynamic programming, instead of using exact methods and optimization solvers. There is also scope to obtain sub-optimal integer solutions in a more time efficient manner by using heuristic methods (GRASP for instance) instead of using the branch and bound algorithm proposed in this study. Finally more sophisticated techniques such as dual stabilization and dynamic constraint aggregation to speed up the convergence of the column generation process need to be studied and implemented in a way such that they exploit the structure of the specific problem under examination.
