                  This paper studies the group-buying mechanism from a dynamic perspective. We consider a seller that offers a product in the form of group buying (priced low but uncertain) and spot purchasing (priced high but guaranteed). In the case of group buying, the information associated with the number of participating customers is updated in the middle of the sale. Customers are assumed to be strategic with a time-dependent utility. In addition to choosing between spot purchasing and group buying, customers could choose to delay their decisions until the information update. We characterize the customer behavior within a rational expectations framework. We then consider the effect of information and demand dynamics. Our results show that whereas an improvement in information quality has a positive effect on customer surplus and the group-buying success rate, the effect of inter-temporal demand correlation is mixed. We also discuss the seller’s profit maximization problem and derive the condition to be satisfied at the optimal group size.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Group buying has emerged as a popular sales strategy in the new millennium. Also known as collective buying, it “offers products and services at significantly reduced prices on the condition that a minimum number of buyers would make the purchase.”
                        1
                        Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_buying/.
                     
                     
                        1
                      Sellers usually offer group buying through third-party platform firms such as Groupon and LivingSocial.com. It is estimated that the total global group-buying market will reach nearly $4billion by 2015.

The rationale behind the group-buying business model has attracted much interest (e.g., see Doukidis, Pramatari, & Lekakos, 2008, Dholakia, 2010, Edelman et al., 2012, Jing & Xie, 2011). One of the most distinctive features of the strategy is that group-buying customers receive products at a discount price only if the minimum number of the sales volume is reached. Due to this uncertainty, group buying could induce customer social interaction, which aligns the interests of participating customers with that of the seller (Jing & Xie, 2011). Group buying can therefore extract an effort from group-buying customers to help the seller boost its sales. Although it is debatable whether such an effort extraction is unique to group buying,
                        2
                        The dynamic pricing strategy, for instance, may incorporate a dynamic diffusion among customers (Bass, 1969), which induces the seller to adopt a lower price at an early stage. This is one example of penetration pricing.
                     
                     
                        2
                      there is no doubt that the mutual influence among customers plays a key role in shaping the demand. Jing and Xie (2011) demonstrate this observation in a static setting, and we aim to study it in a dynamic framework. The shift from static to dynamic introduces some interesting problems. For example, in a dynamic setting, group buying must deal with inter-temporal demand shift, a condition further contingent on the information updated during its course (more specifically, the information that reveals the number of existing group-buying customers). The practical implications of this study have been confirmed by empirical work (Kauffman & Wang, 2001, 2002; Kauffman, Lai, & Ho, 2010a, Kauffman, Lai, & Lin, 2010b; Zhou, Xu, & Liao, 2013). The empirical work shows that group-buying demand is indeed influenced by customers’ observation of the number of existing customers. In addition to discussing the effect of the information update, we also investigate the effectiveness of using group buying as a means for price discrimination. Due to the popularity of group-buying platforms such as Groupon and LivingSocial.com, sellers usually only pay attention to the advertising effect of group buying, and thus overlook that the strategy also serves the purpose of price discrimination. We study this overshadowed function of group buying and reveal the underlying tradeoff: On the one hand, sellers could make use of group buying to expand their customer bases; on the other hand, they do not want group buying to erode those high-margin customers who would otherwise purchase at a higher price in the spot sales.

To investigate how the mutual influence among group-buying customers takes effect in a dynamic way, we incorporate three key elements into our analysis: strategic customer behavior, information dynamics and demand dynamics. Strategic customer behavior indicates that customers can shift their purchasing decisions inter-temporally. For instance, Kauffman and Wang (2001) observe that when the percentage of orders required to reach the next price drop is 25% or less, there is an average of 4.264 more orders per 3-hour time period (or 2.961 if limit orders are excluded). They refer to this as the before-price drop effect (BPDE) and provide a possible explanation: “When the numbers of orders needed are small enough to be within a potential buyer’s perceived price threshold, the person will be more likely to act upon the expectation that the price will drop in the near future.” Hence, to achieve information advantage, customers find it rational to delay their decisions. The informational concern brings out the second key element in our analysis: information dynamics. In this connection, we first consider a dichotomous-choice situation involving information revelation and then generalize our discussion to information quality. Our results show that information revelation or an improvement in information quality benefits customers and also increases the group-buying success rate. The third key element, i.e., demand dynamics, reveals how different inter-temporal realizations of demand affect customer behavior. Such dynamics are of interest because newly arrived customers choose whether to participate in the group buying based on the number of existing customers, thus offering a positive feedback. More specifically, in the case of group buying, the early influx of group-buying customers may induce more to follow, which accords with a positive-feedback pattern (see Shapiro & Varian, 1999). Nonetheless, we show that the effects of such positive feedback on customer surplus and group buying are both mixed. That is, positive feedback does not necessarily improve the customer surplus or the seller’s profit. Positive feedback can work in two ways. First, it attracts more customers when the early demand realization is good. Second, when the early demand realization is bad, it works in the opposite way to depress future demand.
                        3
                        A similar discussion regarding the chilling/warming effect of network externalities on product growth can be found in the marketing literature (Goldenberg, Libai, & Muller, 2010; Tellis, 2010).
                     
                     
                        3
                      Hence, the overall effect is mixed.

We conduct our analysis using a two-period model. Two options, i.e., group buying and spot buying, are provided in each period at different prices. For the spot-buying option, delivery is made immediately, and for the group-buying option, delivery is scheduled at the end of the second period. There are two customer segments in each period, labelled as high-end and low-end. High-end customers can choose either option and shift their purchasing decisions inter-temporally. The number of low-end customers in each period is random, which makes delaying their decisions to wait for the information update at the beginning of the second period (i.e., the revelation of the number of existing group-buying customers) meaningful for the high-end customers, who arrive early. However, utility loss occurs due to the delay. All of the results obtained in the analysis are based on the assumption of rational expectations (RE), i.e., customers have a true belief in the group-buying success rate.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the related literature and identify our contributions. In Section 3, we present the model setup and derive the main results of the general model. We differentiate the general model in Section 4 according to the information and demand dynamics and provide a discussion of seller-side optimization. We carry out the numerical studies in Section 5. We conclude the paper with a discussion of future research topics in Section 6.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Our work adds to the substantial literature on strategic customer behavior in the context of operations management. When customers are strategic, they are able to shift their demands inter-temporally to maximize their payoffs. Strategic customers can be either backward (Popescu & Wu, 2007; Ahn, Gümüş, & Kaminsky, 2007, 2009) or forward looking (Su, 2007; Aviv & Pazgal, 2008; Elmaghraby, Gümüş, & Keskinocak, 2008; Liu & van Ryzin, 2008; Su & Zhang, 2008, 2009; Cachon & Swinney, 2009; Yin, Aviv, Pazgal, & Tang, 2009; Lai, Debo, & Sycara, 2010; Su, 2010; Liu & van Ryzin, 2011; Mersereau & Zhang, 2012). Backward-looking customers recall a seller’s past actions, and forward-looking customers form beliefs about a seller’s future actions. The beliefs of forward-looking customers are usually assumed to be equal to their true statistical values, i.e., they are REs, (Cachon & Swinney, 2009). In this work, we restrict our attention to forward-looking customers.

Most of the literature focuses on the effect of strategic customer behavior on conventional strategies such as dynamic pricing. Liu and van Ryzin (2008) study the markdown strategy in the presence of risk-averse strategic customers. To curb speculation, the seller manipulates the rationing risk to induce customers to purchase early at a higher price. They derive the optimal inventory decision and investigate its sensitivity to factors such as the degree of risk aversion. Aviv and Pazgal (2008) consider the markdown problem in a continuous-time setting. A seller switches to a discount price at a fixed time, and strategic customers who choose to wait face the rationing risk. Two pricing strategies are discussed: contingent and pre-announced. They derive the conditions satisfied at possible equilibria, show the superiority of the pre-announced pricing strategy and indicate that the omission of strategic customer behavior can incur a huge revenue loss. Su (2007) considers the optimal pricing policy in a continuous-time setting where customers have heterogenous valuation and degrees of patience. He shows that whether the seller adopts a markdown or markup policy depends on the correlation between the valuation and degree of patience. He also finds that the seller may benefit from customers’ waiting behavior through an increased rationing risk. Elmaghraby et al. (2008) consider the optimal markdown problem based on two information cases: a complete information (CI) case, in which the seller knows all of the customers’ valuations, and an incomplete information (IV) case, in which the seller’s knowledge about each customer’s valuation is drawn from some distribution. In the CI case, the optimal markdown strategy is a simple two-step markdown, and the buyers bid all-or-nothing at some step. In the IV case, while the latter result holds, the simple structure of the optimal markdown strategy is absent.

As the literature surveyed, we consider informational benefits in addition to the group-buying discount. Strategic customers form beliefs about the group-buying success rate. The accuracy of their beliefs improves temporally as more uncertainty is resolved. Hence, this information dynamic induces customers to delay their decisions until more information is available.

Our work also complements the growing research on group buying that uses analytical approaches. There are commonly two forms of group buying: dynamic-price and fixed-price.

                        4
                      The final realized price in dynamic-price group buying is contingent on the final number of participants. In general, the more participants there are, the lower the final price. Fixed-price group buying adopts a simpler form, in which the final group-buying price is known in advance. This form of group buying is successful as long as the number of participants exceeds the preset threshold. In terms of dynamic-price group buying, Chen, Chen, and Song (2002) consider group buying as an online bidding process where the final price depends on the number of successful bidders. They prove that there exists a weakly dominant strategy according to which each bidder should bid the highest permitted price below his/her true valuation of the product. Anand and Aron (2003) provide a survey of online group-buying markets and then compare group buying with the conventional posted-price mechanism. They show that group buying may outperform the posted-price mechanism under (1) demand heterogeneity and (2) production postponement in combination with scale economies. Chen, Chen, and Song (2007) compare the group-buying auction and the fixed pricing mechanism and find that the optimal group-buying auction is equivalent to the optimal fixed pricing mechanism. Li, Sycara, and Scheller-Wolf (2010) introduce the concept of combinatorial coalition formation (CCF) to model multi-item group buying with heterogeneous customers and develop an algorithm to determine the optimal coalition configuration. Chen, Kauffman, Liu, and Song (2010) explore the role of demand uncertainty in group-buying auctions and find that group buying is more effective when there is larger low-valuation demand than high-valuation demand. Chen and Roma (2011) investigate group buying in a competitive setting. Their results indicate that in a supply chain with one supplier and two retailers, symmetric retailers are always better off with group buying. For asymmetric retailers, although the weak retailer is better off, the strong retailer may be worse off given that group buying weakens its competitive advantage. Hsieh and Lin (2012) demonstrate that the group-buying-based combinatorial reverse auction is better than multiple independent combinatorial reverse auctions in terms of performance and computational efficiency. In terms of fixed-price group buying, Jing and Xie (2011) look at the social aspect of group buying. They show that one benefit of adopting group buying is that it can motivate informed customers to work as “sales agents” to help attract less-informed customers. Compared with traditional individual-selling strategies, group buying is superior when the interpersonal information sharing is efficient and when the information/knowledge gap between expert and novice consumers is neither too high nor too low. Chen, Liang, Wang, and Yan (2012) derive the optimal inventory rationing and replenishment policies for a retailer facing multiple demand classes. Edelman, Jaffe, and Kominers (2012) examine two benefits of using services such as Groupon: price discrimination and advertising. They conclude that the sellers who benefit most are those who are patient and unknown and have low marginal costs. In this paper, we focus on fixed-price group buying.

The closest work to this paper is that of Hu, Shi, and Wu (2011), who study a two-period game in which segments of customers arrive sequentially. Customers decide whether to participate in group buying when there are no alternative options available. They investigate the design of the information management strategy from the seller’s perspective and find that a sequential mechanism in which the number of sign-ups in the group-buying deal is revealed sequentially yields a larger success rate than the simultaneous mechanism without information revelation. This result remains true when customer segments can strategically delay their decisions or when a multi-level price schedule is offered. For the sequential mechanism, Hu et al. (2011) show that the success rate is larger if the seller can inform the smaller customer segment first.

In contrast to Hu et al. (2011), we look at the price-discrimination aspect of group buying and discuss the effects of strategic customer behavior on group buying. To this end, we use a model that incorporates two customer segments and two purchasing options: spot and group buying. Customers must choose between the two options and decide whether to delay purchasing for informational benefits. The seller’s objective is to balance the tradeoff between a large customer base (one that incorporates as many group-buying customers as possible) and a relatively high margin (achieved by pushing high-end customers into the spot-buying option). After characterizing customer behavior within a rational expectations framework, we focus on the profit optimization problem for the seller. Information and demand dynamics are then taken into consideration to study their influences on customer surplus, the group-buying success rate, and the seller’s profit. It is interesting to point out that when discussing information dynamics in this new setting, we reproduce the finding of Hu et al. (2011) that information revelation yields a larger group-buying success rate and a higher customer surplus.

We consider a firm selling a product over a finite period of time. The selling horizon is further split into two periods. The seller offers two purchasing options in each period: a spot-buying option available at price p
                     
                        S
                      and a group-buying option available at a discount price p
                     
                        G
                     
                     <
                     p
                     
                        S
                     . The spot-buying option delivers products to purchasing customers immediately, and the group-buying option delivers products to participating customers conditionally on the success of the group-buying option. Group buying is successful only if the number of participating customers at the end of the second period (i.e., the group-buying cutoff time) exceeds a preset threshold G. Otherwise, the group-buying option fails.
                        5
                        We may also address the case in which group buying is implemented in the form of a progressive discount. The nature of the analysis remains the same.
                     
                     
                        5
                      There is no inventory constraint and therefore no rationing risk in the model.

There are two customer segments in each period: low-end and high-end. Low-end customers exhibit a willingness-to-pay (WTP), w
                     
                        L
                     , such that p
                     
                        G
                     
                     ⩽
                     w
                     
                        L
                     
                     <
                     p
                     
                        S
                     . Low-end customers are thus only interested in the group-buying option. The demands for the low-end customers are assumed to be D
                     1 and D
                     2 for periods 1 and 2, respectively. We assume that D
                     1 and D
                     2 have a joint distribution function F(·,·). The marginal distributions for D

                     , respectively. In contrast, the WTP of the high-end customers, is greater than p
                     
                        S
                     . These customers find both purchasing options of interest. The group-buying option has a higher potential payoff; however, its outcome is uncertain, and first-period customers have to wait for delivery. (Note that we use first/second-period customers to indicate those customers who arrive in the corresponding periods, and use customers in the first/second-period to indicate those who are present in the market in the corresponding periods. Customers in the second period may include any high-end customers remaining from the first period.) Hence, high-end customers are the strategic customers in our model. For analytical convenience, their demand sizes in both periods are assumed to be constant and normalized to one.
                        6
                        We should point out that this is an inessential simplifying assumption. We could conduct the same analysis for the general case where this assumption is relaxed. Nonetheless, we make this assumption for easy exposition.

The event sequence can be described as follows. In the first period, low-end customers arrive and enroll in the group-buying option. High-end customers choose between the spot-buying option and remaining in the market until the second period based on their expectations of the group-buying success rate. (It should be noted that because the group-buying delivery time is set for the end of the second period, high-end customers do not have an incentive to enroll in the group-buying option in the first period. In other words, delaying the group-buying decision is a dominating strategy compared with enrolling in the group-buying option in the first period.

                        We should also point out that although it is not considered in this paper, when the number of existing customers is viewed as a signal of product quality by future customers and thus has a positive effect, it may encourage high-end customers to enroll early.

                     ) At the beginning of the second period, the number of realized group-buying customers (i.e., the number of low-end customers) in the first period is revealed, denoted by g. Because the second-period low-end customers have not been realized, the outcome of the group-buying option is uncertain. Based on this information update, high-end customers who stay renew their belief in the group-buying success rate, denoted by

First-period high-end customers are clearly able to collect more information about the group-buying option through waiting. However, this informational benefit comes at the cost of a discounted payoff due to delayed consumption/delivery. In Fig. 1
                      (GB=group buying, S=successful, US=unsuccessful), we model decision trees for the high-end customers (represented by the black dots) in the two periods.

                     Assumption 1 is intuitive. As more customers enroll in the group-buying option, it becomes more likely that the option will be successful. This assumption holds for all of the scenarios we consider in this paper. In the following analysis, we derive the optimal responses for high-end customers in both periods with the belief

We begin by examining the second period using backwards reasoning.

                              , it is optimal for the high-end customers in the second period to enroll in the group-buying option and to choose the spot-buying option otherwise.
                           

Given the assumption in our model that high-end customers have a homogeneous WTP, they should take the same action, i.e., choose the spot or group-buying options all together. Either could produce an equilibrium outcome. For example, consider an extreme case in which threshold G is equal to the total number of potential group-buying customers. There exist two possible Nash equilibrium outcomes: either all or none of the customers enrolls in the group-buying option. However, as there is no additional participation cost incurred, the all-participating equilibrium is always Pareto superior. We thus only consider this possibility in our analysis.

A high-end customer’s payoff after his/her decision is therefore

                         to represent the customer surplus of high-end customers in the second period.

We now move back to the first period, in which the high-end customers choose between the spot-buying option and delaying their purchasing decisions until the second period after g is revealed. Delaying their decisions is beneficial, as customers can choose the group-buying option only when its success is highly likely, which yields a larger customer surplus; however, it also costs those remaining customers due to the discount factor δ. Viewed from the first period, g has not been realized and is still a random variable following the distribution of D

In the preceding analysis, we show that the optimal responses for high-end customers in both periods with given beliefs are of a threshold type. We now consider those beliefs to be rational, i.e., consistent with the true statistical values. Hence, rather than taken as exogenously given, the beliefs are now affected by the customers’ decisions.

As specified in Definition 1, REs do not necessarily exist; however, if they do exist, they are fixed points of the success rate function. The group size G is still given. In the later analysis, we allow G to be optimized by the seller, which extends the discussion to the rational expectations equilibrium (REE).

C1 and C2 correspond to the optimal conditions for the first-period high-end customers to delay and not to delay their purchasing decisions, respectively. C1 and C2 are key to the characterization of the RE. We thus derive the following additional properties of these two conditions.

                        Theorem 1 guarantees the existence of at least one RE. However, it does not eliminate the possibility that C1 and C2 both hold, in which case there are two REs. Nonetheless, according to Proposition 5, the LHS of C1 is larger than that of C2. This relation indicates that the first-period high-end customers would rather delay their decisions than choose the spot-buying option in the first period. In other words, RE-1 is preferred when both REs exist. With this dominance relation established, we are able to further simplify the results.

From Theorem 1, we know that the LHS of C1 (C2) is the customer surplus of first-period high-end customers with (without) the delayed decisions involving RE-1 (RE-2), i.e.,

                              , C1 is not true and C2 is true. RE-2 is the unique RE.
                           


                        Proposition 7 also implies that the first-period high-end customers are more likely to delay their decisions until the second period as G decreases, which means the group-buying success rate is larger.

Consider the following extreme cases. When G is large enough, the first term of the LHS of both C1 and C2 dominates the second term. Hence, C2 holds and C1 does not. This is intuitive because when G is large, the group-buying option is highly unlikely, as customers would not choose to wait. On the contrary, when G is small enough, we can see that C2 is false and that C1 holds. This indicates that customers would choose to wait because the group-buying option is highly likely. If the discount factor δ is small enough, C2 is true, which implies that the first-period high-end customers would choose the spot-buying option in the first period. With a small δ, delayed purchasing would cause a large utility loss. These observations are generalized in the following proposition:

                              ) decreases or δ increases.
                           


                        Proposition 8 implies that as p

                         increases or p
                        
                           G
                         decreases, the group-buying option becomes more attractive to the first-period high-end customers, and therefore they are more likely to delay their decisions. A smaller waiting cost, i.e., when δ increases, also results in an increased tendency for first-period high-end customers to delay their decisions.

To facilitate our later analysis, we look at the customer surplus with different REs. With RE-1, the expected customer surplus of first-period high-end customers is

In this section, we continue our discussion to differentiate the preceding general model into more specific models based on information and demand dynamics. Our discussion focuses on how customer decisions and customer surplus are affected by these factors.


                        Information revelation. In the base model, there is an information update at the beginning of the second period. What if the decision whether to reveal the information g to customers was instead up to the seller? If the moral hazard is not considered (i.e., if we assume that the seller always reveals true information), then the essence of the problem relates to information revelation: Does the information update benefit customers?

Without the information revelation, first-period high-end customers have no incentive to delay their decisions, and thus the model may be simplified. Suppose every high-end customer holds the same belief in the success rate, denoted by

                        Proposition 9 indicates that information revelation increases the expected customer surplus of high-end customers as well as the group-buying success rate. We should point out that this conclusion reaffirms the results of Hu et al. (2011) in a different model setting. Their results show that a sequential group-buying mechanism is superior to a simultaneous counterpart in the sense that posting the cumulative number of sign-ups from the first period induces more total sign-ups and thus increases the success rate.


                        Information quality. The preceding discussion of information revelation may be extended to a more general setting that involves information quality, i.e., the accuracy of using g to update customers’ estimations of D
                        2.

We assume that D
                        2 has an actual distribution with an explicit algebraic form. All of the distribution’s parameters are given except its mean, which is contingent on g,

                              g

                        . However, customers are not able to observe the precise ϕ(g). Instead, their estimation of the mean of D

                        , follows a uniform distribution on [ϕ(g)−
                        α,ϕ(g)+
                        α].
                           Definition 3
                           The information quality is said to be better if α decreases.


                              Given g, the customer surplus of high-end customers in the second period increases as α decreases.
                           

We provide an intuitive explanation for Lemma 1. High-end customers who choose the group-buying option in the second period may experience its failure, in which case those customers would have been better off if they had chosen the spot-buying option. The probability of this unfavorable outcome is reduced with the improvement of the information quality.
                           Proposition 10
                           
                              When the information quality improves, the high-end customers in the second period achieve a higher customer surplus. The first-period high-end customers are more willing to delay their decisions and the group-buying success rate is also larger.
                           

In our preceding analysis, we use a joint distribution F(·,·) to characterize the demand in the two periods. In this section, we further differentiate this general assumption according to the demand dynamics.

The stochastic order of D
                        2 can be understood as a stronger positive effect induced by the first-period group-buying demand. This could happen when, for example, the social effect of the first-period group-buying demand is larger, or its role as a signal of quality is further enhanced. In this case, Proposition 11 simply indicates that first-period high-end customers are more willing to delay their decisions, and that the customer surplus is larger. We similarly have the following proposition.

                        Inter-temporal demand correlation. The next elaboration of the model is the inter-temporal demand correlation. We consider two specific cases, in which D
                        1 and D
                        2 are either independent (the ID case) or positively correlated (the PC case). In the PC case, a higher g leads to a stochastically higher D
                        2.
                           8
                           It is worth pointing out that the scenarios discussed here bear some resemblance to the demand-splitting cases in a study by Lippman and McCardle (1997), in which they analyze the relation between the demands of the two competing retailers. However, the relation in their model is horizontal (between competing retailers) and ours is vertical (inter-temporal, and for the same seller).
                        
                        
                           8
                        
                     

This study has practical implications. The ID case represents a benchmark where customer arrivals in the two periods are not inter-temporally connected. Hence, although the signal g allows the remaining high-end customers to better predict the group-buying success rate, it does not give them more information on D
                        2. In contrast with the ID scenario, in the PC case, customers can use g to better identify D
                        2, e.g., the early arrival of customers may reveal the demand rate that may be used to forecast future demands.

Note that there is a key difference between our preceding discussion of information quality and the current demand-correlation discussion. In the former case, as the information quality improves, the conditional distribution of D
                        2 for a given g should be closer to the true distribution. Hence, high-end customers who make their decisions in the second period can achieve a higher surplus as shown. However, this may not be the case for the discussion of the correlation between D
                        1 and D
                        2. That is, the correlation between D
                        1 and D
                        2 does not necessarily make customers better off. Although first-period customers are more willing to wait as the information quality improves, the influence of the inter-temporal demand correlation on their behavior is uncertain.

The following simple example may help to illustrate this reasoning. Assume that D
                        1 and D
                        2 both follow two-state distributions in the ID and PC cases. In the ID case, their distributions are independent. Both realize a high demand state d
                        
                           H
                         with probability α and a low demand state d
                        
                           L
                         with probability 1−
                        α. In the PC case, we assume that

The intuition that the correlation between D
                        1 and D
                        2 would not increase the customer surplus can be explained as follows. In the PC case, a higher g leads to a stochastically higher D
                        2. A high g implies that the group-buying option is more likely to be successful, and a low g implies the opposite. However, this does not necessarily increase the overall expected customer surplus. Consider the case where g is low. Customers may still anticipate the group-buying option to be successful in the ID case if the second-period low-end demand turns out to be high; however, this probability diminishes when D
                        1 and D
                        2 are positively correlated.

We prove the existence of an RE and analyze its properties when G is given. We now look at the optimization of G on the seller side to maximize its profit. If customers behave as in Definition 1, the optimization completes the requirements for the REE.

We first provide the profit functions for G
                        <
                        G
                        
                           RE
                         and for G
                        ⩾
                        G
                        
                           RE
                        . When G
                        <
                        G
                        
                           RE
                        , according to Proposition 7, RE-1 is the dominant RE and first-period high-end customers delay their decisions until the second period. The total expected profit of the seller is therefore

                        The first part is the revenue from the first-period high-end customers. The second part corresponds to the case where the second-period high-end customers choose the group-buying option, and the third part corresponds to the case where the second-period high-end customers choose the spot-buying option.

Customers may be separated into four groups according to their arrival times and WTP types: first/second-period, high/low-end customers. We investigate their behaviors under a given G in our preceding analysis. To obtain the optimal G and optimal profit for the seller, it suffices to analyze the effect of a varying G on the four groups of customers. Look at the two groups of low-end customers. Their revenue contribution decreases as G increases for two reasons. First, a higher G directly lowers the group-buying success rate. Second, a higher G, according to our preceding results, also hinders high-end customers from enrolling in the group-buying option, which further decreases its success rate. The seller tries to extract a higher margin from the high-end customers rather than retain them in the market. A higher G thus increases their revenue contribution.

It is therefore natural to further split the change of revenue in terms of G into two parts: marginal revenue loss and marginal revenue gain. Denote them as c(G) and r(G), respectively. The sum of these two parts should obviously be equal to the marginal revenue, which is dΠ(G)/dG. When the optimum is not achieved at boundaries, i.e., when G
                        =0 or G
                        =∞, we should have dΠ(G)/dG
                        =0 at the optimum. That is, c(G)=
                        r(G).

However, Π(G) does not possess a well-behaved structure, i.e., concave or unimodal.
                           Example 1
                           Consider a simple example where D
                              2
                              =0. That is, all of the uncertainty lies in the first period. When G
                              <
                              G

                              ⩽2, Π(G) decreases in G. The intuition can be explained as follows. When G is small, all of the customers enroll in the group-buying option. A small increment in G therefore decreases the group-buying success rate and results in profit loss. When G
                              >2 and G
                              <
                              G
                              
                                 RE
                              , if p
                              
                                 S
                               is large, the marginal revenue gain may dominate the marginal revenue loss, which implies that Π
                              
                                 ID
                              (G) increases in G. Hence, Π(G) could be neither concave nor unimodal within the feasible range.

The lack of a well-behaved structure may result from many factors such as prices and discount factor having a role in determining the optimal G, which complicates the tradeoff. However, we can derive the bounds of the optimal profit.

Consider two extreme cases where only high-end or low-end customers exist in the market. In the former case, the optimal G is obviously infinite, so the seller can extract the highest margin from all of the high-end customers. In the latter case, the optimal G is 0, so all of the low-end customers are retained. When both groups are present in the market, the seller could choose some intermediate value of G to balance the tradeoff between profit margin and total demand. Let Π(G) be the seller’s profit.

                        RE
                     . The results are summarized in Table 1
                     .

It can be observed from the results that G
                     
                        RE
                      is larger, which implies that the success rate is higher, and the optimal profit is higher in the PC case. This is easy to understand as in the PC case the second-period low-end demand is stochastically larger compared with that in the ID case. Our results justify the arguments in Proposition 11. However, it can also be observed from Table 1 that the optimal G does not necessarily increase with demand correlation. As explained in Section 4.3, a higher success rate may cause revenue loss, as high-end customers are more likely to switch to the group-buying option from the spot-buying option. Hence, in some simulations, the optimal G could be large enough in the PC case to decrease the group-buying success rate such that the high-end customers would choose the spot-buying option. Similar arguments also suggest that the optimal profit and G

In terms of the effect of the prices on the optimal G and the optimal profit, we find that as p

                        S

                     . At the same time, this leads to a larger group-buying customer base and a higher success rate, which may reduce the overall profit. Hence, the seller has an incentive to set a high G to curb the high-end customers from choosing the group-buying option. The optimal profit is similarly not monotonic in the spot price. This observation can be understood from a market segmentation perspective. A large gap between p

                        S
                      may not benefit the seller considering the revenue loss incurred by the switch of high-end customers from the spot-buying option to the group-buying option.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this work, we study the group-buying mechanism in a dynamic framework. Customers make their purchasing decisions inter-temporally to maximize their time-dependent payoffs. The information update during the course of group buying also plays an important role in inducing customers to delay their decisions. We characterize the best responses on the customer side with given beliefs in the group-buying success rate, and those when the beliefs are rational. We then differentiate the general model based on information and demand dynamics. Our results show that the customer surplus and the group-buying success rate both increase as the information quality improves, and that the effect of the inter-temporal demand correlation is mixed. We also provide a discussion on the optimization of G on the seller side. Although we are unable to obtain a well-behaved structure for the profit function, we establish the condition satisfied at the optimal G.

A natural extension of our work is to investigate the optimal timing of information revelation. This would lead to a substantially more challenging model that involves optimal stopping. Suppose that g is kept private in the beginning, and then revealed at some time point by the seller, whereupon it remains public. The temporal distributions of low-end and high-end customers before and after the information disclosure would be thus affected by the timing of the revelation. In addition, strategic high-end customers calculate the delayed utility and informational benefit based on the expected information disclosure time. When to reveal the information should depend on the seller’s sales process. For example, revealing a high g could lure more customers into the group-buying option and be helpful when the seller wants to clear its inventory. Revealing a low g could similarly help when the seller wants to push customers into spot purchasing. The optimal policy is thus contingent on the real-time states of the system.

Another meaningful extension would be to incorporate more aspects of the information. For example, customers often give reviews on group-buying websites, and the review polarity may influence the evolution of the group-buying process. When inventory is factored in, the dynamic inventory status information could affect the customers’ estimate of the desirability of the product or their anticipation of the chance of receiving the allocation if rationing is considered (Liu & van Ryzin, 2008).

                               is closer to the actual ϕ(g). Using a sample path analysis, we can prove that the customer surplus increases under this condition. □


                        
                           Proof
                           According to Lemma 1, the first conclusion, i.e., that the customer surplus of high-end customers in the second period increases is straightforward. The first-period high-end customers thus also receive a higher expected payoff which indicates that delaying decisions should be more favorable. This consequently increases the group-buying success rate. □
