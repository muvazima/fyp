                  This paper studies the implications of upstream and/or downstream horizontal mergers on suppliers, retailers and consumers, in a bilateral oligopolistic system. We especially focus on market power and operational synergy benefits that such mergers engender. Starting with a benchmark pre-merger scenario in which firms compete on prices at each level, we find that the above two consequences individually almost have opposite effects on the merging and non-merging firms’ optimal decisions/profits after a merger. Furthermore, even though the effects of upstream and downstream mergers are different, the vertical supply chain partners will always try to reduce their losses if the market power effect dominates, but will take actions that improve their profits if the synergy effect is stronger. The above results are robust enough to hold even when taking into account intra-brand competition among retailers.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Mergers and acquisitions continue to show remarkable resilience in both deal values and volumes even after the financial crisis of 2008. Many of the largest transactions in this context occur between companies in the same industry (i.e., horizontal mergers). Examples include those between Kraft and Heinz (49 billion dollars) in the food industry, Staples and Office Depot (6 billion dollars) in the retail sector dealing with office supplies, Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc (70 billion dollars) in the cable-TV and high-speed broadband sector, Actavis and Allergan (66 billion dollars) in the pharmaceutical industry, and Halliburton and Baker Hughes (35 billion dollars) in the energy industry (Burrows, 2014). Note that some of the above mergers occur in the consumer-facing downstream part of the supply chain (e.g., Staples and Office Depot) and others take place in more upstream levels (e.g., Kraft and Heinz or Actavis and Allergan).

While there might be a number of motivations behind mergers, the two most important ones are the expected post-merger market power and/or operational synergy benefits (Gale Encyclopedia of E-Commerce, 2002). From the perspective of merging firms, managers usually expect improvements in market share and productive efficiency, irrespective of the level at which the mergers happen (Fee & Thomas, 2004). For example, both Staples+Office Depot and Kraft+Heinz mergers touted the expected cost reduction through supply chain synergies (Martyn, 2015), while the merger between Greencore Group and Northern Foods improved their market power vis-a-vis downstream retailers (Flynn, 2010). Interestingly, non-merging firms – either competitors or partners – in the supply chain are also affected by a merger. Their strategic responses are then crucial to the success/failure of a merger. For example, after purchasing the consumer online service of CompuServe Corp., America Online Inc (AOL) boosted its subscriber base to over 10 million, which allowed it to lower prices to better compete with its upstart competitors (Gale Encyclopedia of E-Commerce, 2002), and there are speculations about how competing manufacturers (e.g., Kellog or Pepsico) and downstream retailers (e.g., Wal-Mart) would respond to Kraft+Heinz merger (DiChristopher, 2015). However, it is worthwhile to point out that, horizontal mergers do not always improve efficiency. For example, Quaker Oats (the producer of Gatorade) failed to realize post-merger synergy after acquiring Snapple in 1994. The merger actually resulted in a loss of 1.4 billion dollars in 27 months. Sears Holding suffered from a revenue loss of more than 10 percent in the four years after its merger with Kmart, while during the same time period, Wal-Mart’s sales rose almost 31 percent and Target’s more than 24 percent (Clifford, 2010).

Motivated by the above examples, we aim to address the following questions in this paper:

                        
                           •
                           How do non-merging chain partners and competitors respond to a horizontal merger?

What are the effects of an upstream versus a downstream horizontal merger on all relevant firms’ (merging and non-merging) decisions and profits?

Under what conditions, if any, does a merger have an adverse effect on supply chain partners and final consumers?

To address the above issues, we use a bilateral oligopoly supply chain framework. In our model, it is not only the merging firms that will adjust their decisions after a horizontal merger, upstream or downstream non-merging supply chain partners/competitors will also respond strategically to the change in market structure. Therefore, the overall profitability impact of mergers on the firms or consumers is not straightforward. In alignment with our previous discussion, we study the two primary effects created by a horizontal merger: increased market power and operational synergy.

As regards market power, in the context of supply chains, there are two kinds of such power that can accrue from mergers – buying power and selling power. Although researchers have extensively examined the effect of upstream horizontal mergers on selling power vis-à-vis customers, conflicting conclusions have been drawn (Bhattacharyya & Nain, 2011). Regarding the effect of downstream horizontal mergers on buying power, Fee and Thomas (2004) and Shahrur (2005) find empirical evidence that such mergers exert price pressure on upstream suppliers and adversely affect their performance. We complement these studies by showing that increased selling and/or buying power due to mergers (due to upstream and downstream merger, respectively) adversely affects the performance of dependent supply chain partner, but positively affects the firms in non-merging competing supply chain.

Concerning operational synergy, merging firms could benefit from it and achieve cost efficiency in multiple ways, such as by reducing production, transaction or fixed costs through economies of scale or scope, learning from their partners’ management expertise, improving production techniques or increasing managerial efficiency (see Trautwein 1990, Farrell & Shapiro 1990, Kim & Singal 1993). In a bilateral supply chain system, we find that while the merging firms and their supply chain partners benefit from synergies and become more profitable after an upstream and/or a downstream merger, the firms in non-merging competing supply chains actually suffer a loss in profitability following the merger.

The market power and operational synergy effects of mergers are not only (almost diametrically) opposite for the merging and non-merging supply chains, they are also so from the perspective of the consumers and social welfare. Specifically, when mergers provide market power they are harmful for both, but are desirable when mergers provide synergy benefits. Note that the seminal paper by Deneckere and Davidson (1985) state that in price-setting games, a merger allows merging firms to absorb a negative externality and elicits a spiral of responses from non-merging rival firms, and both these forces are beneficial to the merging firms. By taking into account the reactions of partners in the supply chain as well as the non-merging competitors, we are able to demonstrate that the effects are more nuanced and differs significantly depending on the particular benefit provided by a merger. The above behavior makes the overall effects of a merger somewhat ambiguous; it depends on which of the two effects dominate
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Several empirical studies indeed supoort this. For example, Kim and Singal (1993) find empirical evidence from airline industry that mergers may lead to more efficient operations, but on the whole, increased market power dominates efficiency gains, making the consumers worse off.
                     . Interestingly, we can show that non-merging firms always prefer an upstream merger, while consumers and the society prefer a downstream one.

Although our above results are based on bilateral supply chains where the suppliers and buyers have exclusive vertical relations, we also explore the robustness of our results by relaxing this assumption in an extended model that incorporates intra-brand competition (i.e., a downstream firm can procure from multiple upstream ones). Although in this case the competition among downstream firms becomes more intense and results in lower prices for consumers, we find that the effects of post-merger market power and synergies are consistent with those in our base model, suggesting that our results are relatively robust.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Horizontal mergers have been the focus of research in economics, strategy and finance for decades. Surprisingly, such mergers have received very little attention in the operations management literature. Researchers in the operations and supply chain management areas are usually more interested in the role of cooperation among competing agents. Although a few papers address the effects of a merger in a supply chain context, such as Fumagalli and Motta (2001), Inderst and Shaffer (2007), and Cho (2013), they either consider a duopoly model or a single product setting. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze the effect of horizontal mergers at both upstream and downstream levels using the Bertrand oligopoly model in a supply chain environment. In this section, we review three streams of literature relevant to our work — classic one-level Cournot and Bertrand horizontal merger models, horizontal mergers in bilateral supply chain models and coalitions in supply chains.

In the economics field, much research has been carried out on the effects of horizontal mergers in the merging industry, mainly focusing on price, quantity, profits and consumer welfare. The seminal work of Williamson (1968) demonstrates that in the cases where there are efficiency and market power consequences, the existence of economies of scale is important for the Antitrust Division of Department of Justice to consider before deciding to challenge a merger. More recently, Salant, Switzer, and Reynolds (1983) show that in the context of a symmetric Cournot oligopoly with linear demand and costs, mergers are not profitable unless more than 80 percent of the firms collude. Subsequently, Perry and Porter (1985) reveal that the incentive to merge depends upon a complex resolution of two forces: first, a merger results in a price increase; and second, the output of the merged firm declines relative to that of its competitors before the merger. The price increase resulting from a merger benefits all firms in the merging firms’ industry. This can often be sufficient to compensate for the output reduction of the merged firm and increase profits. Similarly, Farrell and Shapiro (1990) and McAfee and Williams (1992) also use Cournot models to analyze the welfare effects of horizontal mergers.

Taking a different perspective, Deneckere and Davidson (1985) were the first to study the effects of mergers using the Bertrand model, in which firms compete on price by selling differentiated products that are imperfectly substitutable. They show that mergers of any size are beneficial, and increasingly profitable in the sense that large mergers yield higher profits than smaller ones. This is in contrast to the finding that mergers tend to be disadvantageous in Cournot quantity-setting models. A similar result is obtained for the logit demand model by Werden and Froeb (1994). Moreover, Werden (1996) studies the effect of merger-induced cost efficiency. He introduces a practical way to compute the exact marginal cost reduction that assures an enhancement of consumer welfare from a differentiated product merger. Froeb, Tschantz, and Werden (2005) suggest that both the price effects of mergers and the pass-through reduction in marginal cost to consumers depend on the curvature of demand.

While most studies investigate the effects of mergers on the merging industry, only a few have studied the effects of mergers on the upstream or downstream industry. Focusing on the contract between upstream suppliers and downstream retailers, Horn and Wolinsky (1988) show that when downstream firms compete with substitutable products, a monopoly supplier is more profitable than two independent suppliers, if linear wholesale price contracts are employed. In contrast, if firms in vertical supply chains bargain over two-part tariff contracts, Milliou and Petrakis (2007) find that in the absence of any efficiency gains, the upstream firms have no incentive to merge. Werden (2007) also studies the price effects of upstream manufacturers’ mergers on profit-maximizing price-setting strategies. Although these studies consider the effects of mergers in a bilateral system, they only analyze the upstream effects, not those that take place at the downstream level. Ziss (1995) was the first to compare the effects of horizontal mergers at two levels. He shows that under a linear demand and cost function, a downstream merger is pro-competitive but an upstream merger is anti-competitive for both price and quantity competition. Focusing on how a merger affects welfare, Fumagalli and Motta (2001) study how the equilibrium outcomes change if two upstream or downstream firms merge. They find that a downstream monopolist is more detrimental to the entire welfare than an upstream monopolist if the vertical contract between a manufacturer and a retailer is unobservable, whereas if contracts are observable then both monopolists are equally detrimental to welfare.

The aforementioned studies of mergers in vertical supply chains assume a duopoly market at each level. The major limitation of a duopoly model is that a horizontal merger will lead to a monopoly, which is often prohibited in the real world. Furthermore, in most industries there are more than two firms in the market, so a two-firm merger does not create a monopoly. In a Cournot oligopoly model, Lommerud, Straume, and Sørgard (2005) show that a downstream merger reduces the merging firms’ input prices, while the non-merging firm’s input price change depends on the degree of product differentiation and suppliers’ preferences. By studying a two-part tariff contract in a Cournot oligopoly model, Faulí-Oller and Bru (2008) show that a downstream merger is profitable without cost efficiency. However, they assume that there is only one upstream supplier serving n downstream retailers. We extend their analysis by considering a bilateral Bertrand oligopoly model and examine the effects of market power and operational synergy in both upstream and downstream mergers.

By assuming an oligopoly model with three firms at both upstream and downstream levels, Lommerud et al. (2005) examine how a downstream merger influences the input prices charged by upstream suppliers in a bilateral Cournot model. They suggest that a downstream merger reduces the merging firms’ input prices, while the non-merging firm’s input price change depends on the degree of product differentiation and suppliers’ preferences. By studying a two-part tariff contract in a Cournot oligopoly model, Faulí-Oller and Bru (2008) show that a downstream merger is profitable without cost efficiency. However, they assume that there is only one upstream supplier serving n downstream retailers.

In a recent work, Cho (2013) examines the effects of merger in a two-tier supply chain under Cournot competition. The Cournot and Bertrand models are complementary in the sense that Cournot model is adequate if products are homogeneous or undifferentiated (e.g., products oil, gas and electricity, see Budzinski & Ruhmer 2010), while Bertrand model is more suitable for consumer goods markets, where customers have preferences and retailers sell differentiated competing products. Different from the results of Cho (2013) that the competition effect alone does not justify a profitable upstream or downstream merger, we show that merging firms always benefit from increased market power and earn higher profits. In addition, due to the limitation of Cournot model, Cho (2013) indicates that no matter at what level a merger occurs, all of the firms in other tiers will react in the same way. The Bertrand model based analysis in our paper, however, suggests that horizontal mergers have quite different effects on firms in upstream and downstream industry.

This research is also indirectly related to recent supply chain management literature that examines the formation of “coalition” among supply chain agents. In those models, equitable distribution of gains and alliance stability are the keys to a coalition mechanism. Considering a model of three retailers selling substitutable products, Granot and Sošić (2005) find that a firm joining a coalition reduces its own cost and also the cost of other coalition members. Coalition members benefit at the expense of firms left outside the coalition. Other related work includes Nagarajan and Bassok (2008), Nagarajan and Sošić (2007), Granot and Yin (2008) and Huang, Boyacı, Gümüs, Ray, and Zhang (2015). The fundamental difference between coalition and merger is ownership, although there are many others in practice, such as size, relatedness, length of time and degree of integration. Instead of focusing on the conditions under which a firm should join a coalition, we focus on the effects of a merger on different firms.

Finally, a few papers study the cost efficiency or operational synergies created by mergers. Most notably, Gupta and Gerchak (2002) use a newsvendor model framework to quantify operational synergies in a merger. They show that the bidder firm’s characteristics (such as size, flexibility of capacity, and demand patterns) have a significant effect on the value of operational synergy. Federgruen and Pierson (2011) derive the conditions under which post-merger synergies result in a lower equilibrium price under Bertrand competition. We extend their analysis to a two-echelon supply chain and study the effects of operational synergy for all the firms in the system.

Based on the models used in most of the literature related to mergers in vertical supply chains, such as Horn and Wolinsky (1988), Fumagalli and Motta (2001) and Werden (2007), we study a bilateral oligopoly market with three upstream suppliers and three downstream retailers. Each supplier produces and sells a differentiated product to end customers through an exclusive retailer
                           2
                        
                        
                           2
                           As Milliou and Petrakis (2007) point out, exclusive vertical relations are frequently observed in industries, such as car equipment suppliers, car manufacturers, food/drink retailers, and beer distributors etc.
                         (we discuss about non-exclusive supply chains in Section 7). Products are substitutable and, for simplicity, are assumed to have the same production cost cs
                        . Each retailer incurs an operational cost cr
                        . In such a system, there are two dimensions of competition. In the horizontal dimension, both downstream retailers and upstream suppliers compete with each other in a Bertrand–Nash fashion. In the vertical dimension, within each supply chain, firms engage in a Stackelberg competition, in which the supplier is the Stackelberg leader and the retailer is the follower.

                         captures the cross-price elasticity of demand. To investigate the effects of merger in a case where two suppliers or two retailers merge, we start with the pre-merger stage when each firm acts independently, then we discuss the post-merger scenarios and compare the differences among the optimal strategies and profits for each firm.

In the pre-merger stage, each firm at both levels chooses the optimal strategy to maximize its own profit. Each retailer Ri
                        , given a wholesale price wi
                        , will choose a retail price pi
                         to maximize the profit function

This proposition suggests that from a firm’s perspective, both the supplier and the retailer are better off if products in the market are less substitutable (i.e., more heterogeneous). From society’s perspective, the more heterogenous the products are, the higher the overall welfare; while from a consumer’s perspective, the opposite is preferable.

When a merger occurs between two firms in the same industry, we can separate all of the firms in this bilateral supply chain into two groups: insiders (the merging firms and their upstream/downstream supply chain partners) and outsiders (the non-merging firm and its supply chain partner). In this section, we suppose that the merging firms gain greater market power, but no synergy benefit, and choose the optimal pricing strategy to maximize their joint profit after a horizontal merger (we discuss the synergy benefits in Section 5). In the following, we discuss how such increased market power affects supply chain performance after an upstream or a downstream merger.

Suppose upstream supplier S
                        1 and S
                        2 merge and continue to produce two heterogenous products after their merger

                           3
                           For example, after the acquisition of Maxtor Corporation in 2006, Seagate retained a full range of both Maxtor and Seagate branded products in the hard drive industry. In the computer hardware industry, Hewlett–Packard and Compaq kept their own lines in the home PC market after their merger in 2001.
                        . With their increased market power, the two merging suppliers choose the optimal wholesale prices to maximize their joint profit, while the non-merging supplier still maximizes its own profit. Let the superscript U denote the case where two upstream suppliers merge and M denote the effect of market power. For the merging suppliers S

                        2, their problem becomes:

                        3, the problem is the same as (5). As all of the downstream retailers still operate independently, their profit functions remain as defined in (3). By solving the two-level equilibrium equations, we can derive the closed-form expressions for all optimal strategies. Comparing the pre-merger and post-merger equilibria, we obtain the following proposition. For convenience, from now on we use subscript in to denote the inside firms or channel and out to denote the outside firms or channel.

Based on Proposition 2, we summarize the effect of post-merger market power from three perspectives. First, the merging suppliers have greater market power and thus are able to charge a higher wholesale price. The downstream retailers’ optimal price is increasing with the input wholesale price, so the inside retail price also increases. As a result, the demand for inside firms decreases. For the upstream merging suppliers, the benefit from the increased profit margin dominates the negative effect of the demand reduction, so they gain a higher profit after the merger. For the downstream inside retailers, the reductions in both profit margin and demand result in a lower profit.

Second, for outside firms, because there is less competition upstream, the non-merging supplier is able to raise the wholesale price. Based on the optimal pricing scheme, the downstream outside retailer also increases the retail price. However, because the outside retail price is still lower than the inside retailers’ prices after the merger, and hence the outside retailer and supplier both benefit from the increased demand and earn higher profits.

Finally, from a supply chain perspective, the increased upstream market power reduces the inside supply chain’s total profit, while the outside supply chain’s total profit increases after the merger. Both consumer surplus and social welfare are reduced due to the increased prices. In general, when mergers provide greater market power, an upstream merger benefits the merging suppliers and whole merging supply chain at the expense of their “partner” retailers and the consumers.

We now turn to the case where a downstream merger increases the merging retailers’ market power. Suppose retailer R
                        1 and R
                        2 merge and form a new firm that maximizes the profit of two products. We use the superscript DM denote the case where two downstream retailers merge and create greater market power. The merging retailers’ problem becomes

                        The outside retailer still maximizes its own individual profit as defined in (3). In the upstream industry, suppliers operate separately and choose a wholesale price to maximize their own profits. To investigate the effect of increased market power, we compare the pre- and post-merger equilibria, and present the results in Proposition 3.

Similar to the previous case, we summarize the results in Proposition 3 also from three perspectives. First, with greater market power, merging retailers benefit from a higher retail price and lower wholesale price and enjoy a profit increase. Suffering the decline in both profit margin and demand, the profit for upstream inside suppliers decreases after the merger. Second, because competition downstream is less intensive, the outside retailer could also raise the price. As his price is lower than the inside price, both the outside retailer and supplier benefit from the merger and obtain higher profits. Finally, due to the aforementioned effects, merger with a greater market power reduces the total profit of the inside supply chain but increases the profit of the outside supply chain. Both consumer surplus and social welfare are lower than in the pre-merger case due to the higher prices.

In this section, we examine a complementary model to Section 4 - that is, mergers provide synergy benefits, but no market power. Synergy is often cited as the force that enhances the cost efficiencies of a business, which may arise from economies of scale. Similar to previous research (e.g., Farrell and Shapiro (1990), Cho (2013)), we assume that a merger creates synergy, which reduces the unit production or operational cost. To isolate this effect, we assume that merging firms maximize the profit for each product with a lower cost, while other firms in the system operate independently with the original cost after the merger. In the following section, we discuss how this post-merger synergy affects supply chain performance.

Suppose two upstream suppliers, S
                        1 and S
                        2, merge. With the post-merger synergy, both of the merging suppliers enjoy a lower production cost δcs
                        , where δ ∈ (0, 1) captures the degree of post-merger operational synergy. A smaller δ corresponds to a stronger synergy effect. Let the superscript US denote the case where two upstream suppliers merge and create synergy. The merging supplier’s problem becomes

                        Proposition 4 shows that the effect of post-merger synergy is quite different from the effect of increased market power. With the lower production cost, the merging suppliers are able to reduce the wholesale price, which leads to a lower retail price and hence also a higher demand. Such an effect benefits both the merging suppliers and the downstream inside retailers.

To compete with the merging suppliers, the outside non-merging supplier has to lower the wholesale price as well. However, due to the disadvantage in production cost, the outside supplier’s price remains higher than the inside suppliers’ prices. The downstream outside retailer suffers from a relatively high price and has a lower demand. As a result, both the outside supplier’s and the retailer’s profits reduce following the merger.

From a supply chain perspective, both inside supply chains benefit from the upstream post-merger synergy and gain more profit, while the outside supply chain profit is lower than the pre-merger case. Because of the reduction in all retail prices, both consumers and society as a whole benefit from an upstream merger that generates synergy.

We now turn to the case where two downstream retailers R
                        1 and R
                        2 merge. Suppose that with the post-merger synergy, both of the merging retailers are able to reduce their operational cost to δcr
                        , where δ ∈ (0, 1) captures the degree of post-merger operational synergy and it is the same as in the upstream merger case. Let the superscript DS denote the case where two downstream retailers merge and create synergy. The merging retailer’s problem becomes

As shown in Proposition 5, the synergistic effects of the downstream merger are very similar to those of an upstream merger. In fact, when downstream merging retailers benefit from a reduced operational cost, they will lower the retail price to gain more demand. Knowing that such a strategy will increase demand, the upstream inside suppliers tend to raise the wholesale price to take advantage of the higher output quantity. To compete with the reduced inside retail prices, the outside non-merging retailer also has to lower the price. Due to the cost disadvantage, however, the outside retail price remains higher than the inside retailers’ prices. The upstream outside supplier, therefore, cannot afford to raise wholesale prices but instead reduces it to compensate for the loss from demand reduction. From a supply chain perspective, when a downstream merger creates synergy, all of the inside firms benefit and achieve a higher profit, while outside firms suffer a loss. Consumer surplus and social welfare are both improved following the merger.


                        Table 1
                         compares the effects of merger-induced market power and synergy. It shows that with the increased market power, an upstream or a downstream merger always improve the profit of the merging firms while reduce the profit of their supply chain partners. Firms in the outside supply chain benefit from the merger, but final consumers and the whole society are worse off. Our results confirm the findings of Cho (2013) that the competition effect of both an upstream and a downstream merger raises downstream price and reduces output. However, on the contrary of Cho’s claim that competition effects alone does not justify a profitable merger, we find that, with greater market power, a horizontal merger always improve the profit for merging parties. Also different from those results in Cournot setting, we show that the increased selling power has negative effects on related retailers while positive effects on the unrelated retailer, and the increased buying power has negative effects on related suppliers while positive effects on the unrelated supplier.

On the other hand, under the synergy effect, both merging parties and their supply chain partners are able to benefit from an upstream or a downstream merger. Final consumers and the whole society also enjoy a merger in both cases. Only firms in the outside supply chain suffer a loss in profit. These results are generally consistent with the findings of Cho (2013) in the level where a merger occurs. In the other level, however, unlike those results in a Cournot setting that all the firms benefit from the synergy, we show that synergy effect only improves the profit for related partners while reduces the profit for the unrelated firm.

As shown in previous sections, post-merger market power and synergy have markedly different effects on firms, supply chains, final consumers and social welfare. To investigate the aggregate effect of these two forces, in this section, we assume that merging firms gain both greater market power and greater operational synergy after a merger.

In an upstream merger, let the superscript UC denote the case where two upstream suppliers merge and benefit from both market power and operational synergy. The merging suppliers’ problem becomes

                        Solving the two-level profit functions, we can obtain the equilibrium values. However, depending on the value of cs, cr, β, and δ, the combined effects of an upstream merger can be very different. To compare the pre- and post-merger equilibria, we present the following lemma.

As defined earlier, δ captures how much the merging firms can benefit from the post-merger operational synergy, and the feasible range for δ is between 0 and 1. However, depending on the value of cs, cr
                         and β, δUC
                         may fall outside the range. We present two examples of δUC
                         as a function of β for given values of cs
                         and cr

                              If the synergy effect of the merger offsets the increased market power and keeps the merging suppliers’ wholesale price exactly the same as in the pre-merger scenario, i.e.,

                                  then the downstream inside retailers have no incentive to change their retail prices. Indeed, in this case, the demand for each product, the profit for each retailer and the outside supplier and the consumer surplus all remain unchanged from their pre-merger levels. However, benefiting from the reduced cost, the merging suppliers enjoy a higher profit, and social welfare is improved accordingly.

If the combined effects lead to a higher wholesale price for merging suppliers, i.e.,

                                  then it implies that the market power effect is stronger than the synergy effect. Therefore, the non-merging supplier is able to raise the price under the equilibrium. The downstream retailers increase their retail prices accordingly, which is the same as the case where an upstream merger only creates greater market power (Section 4.1).

If the combined effects reduce the inside wholesale prices, i.e.,

                                  then it implies that the synergy effect is stronger than the market power effect. To compete with the merging suppliers, the non-merging supplier has to reduce the outside wholesale price, as in the case where a merger solely generates synergy for the merging suppliers (Section 5.1).

We summarize the aforementioned discussion in the following proposition.

                           Proposition 7
                           
                              (i) If 0 < δUC
                               ≤ 1, then for δ ∈ (δUC
                              , 1), the market power effect dominates the synergy effect and the results are similar to 
                              
                                 Proposition 2
                              
                              . For δ ∈ (0, δUC
                              ), the synergy effect dominates the market power effect and the results are similar to 
                              
                                 Proposition 4
                              
                              . (ii) If δUC
                               ≤ 0, then for any δ ∈ (0, 1), the market power effect dominates the synergy effect and the results are similar to 
                              
                                 Proposition 2
                              
                              .
                           

Generally speaking, when the operational costs cs
                         and cr
                         are relatively high, then there exists a positive threshold δUC
                         > 0, which implies that there are opportunities for the merging firms to realize significant cost saving by merger-induced synergies. Otherwise, if the operational costs are small, then δUC
                         ≤ 0, which means the potential benefits of synergy could be almost negligible, compared to the effects of market power. Therefore, even a very high cost efficiency (δ is close to zero) will not make a significant difference.

We use the superscript DC to denote the case where a downstream merger generates both market power and operational synergy for the merging retailers. Now the non-merging firms’ problems remain the same as in the pre-merger stage, while the two merging retailers’ problem becomes

                        Unlike the upstream merger case, where there might exist a feasible threshold δUC
                         that could balance the two counteracting effects, in the downstream merger there is no such a threshold. Depending on the values of cr, cs, β and δ, the effects of merger on each firm’s strategy are different. Therefore, we first present the following lemma to characterize the effect of δ on price parameters.

Due to space limitations, we provide the detailed expressions only in the appendix. Lemma 8 implies that for a fixed set of cs, cr
                         and β, the dominant effect for each firm could be different. To further investigate the combined effects of a downstream merger, we present the following proposition.

                              Suppose a downstream merger creates both market power and operational synergy to the merging firms. For given cs, cr and β,

                        Proposition 9 (i) shows that if all the critical thresholds are between 0 and 1, the combined effects of a downstream merger vary depending on the position of firms in the market. Among four types of firms, the downstream inside retailers (i.e., the merging firms) experience the greatest effect of the operational synergy and their suppliers are affected the least. Conversely, the market power effect has the least impact on the merging firms and the greatest impact on their suppliers. Because market power and operational synergy have opposite effect on a firm’s pricing strategy, the combination of these two forces might create different results. For example, if

                         because the market power effect is stronger than the synergy effect, the inside supplier will reduce the inside wholesale price. For the outside supplier, the outside wholesale price is also reduced because the synergy effect dominates. In the downstream industry, due to the stronger effect of synergy, both the inside and the outside retail price are lower than the pre-merger level, which is similar to the synergy only case.

                         the market power effect is stronger than the synergy effect for the upstream inside supplier. Therefore, the inside supplier’s optimal strategy is the same as in the market power only case; however, to determine the optimal strategy for other firms, we need to further compare the value of δ with the thresholds

                        . The horizontal axis δ represents the extent of the synergy effect.

As Fig. 2 shows, the combined effects of a downstream merger are much more complicated than those of an upstream merger. In the extreme case where δ equals to 1, there is no synergy effect and it degenerates to the market power only case (same as Section 4.1). As δ gets smaller, the synergy effect increases and becomes stronger. At the other end, where δ is close to zero, the synergy effect dominates the effect of increased market power, and it is similar to the synergy only case (Section 5.2).

Although we show the effects on prices and demand in Fig. 2, we focus our discussion on the impact on profits. Clearly, inside merging retailers’ profit is always higher than in the pre-merger scenario, whereas the non-merging retailer’s profit is higher than the pre-merger level when the synergy effect is small, but decreases as the δ becomes smaller. In the upstream industry, if the synergy effect is strong, then the inside supplier benefits while the outside supplier suffers; if the synergy effect is weak, then it is the other way around. As long as there is some synergy (

                         compares the combined effects of an upstream and a downstream merger. Not surprisingly, we find that inside firms prefer mergers at their own level. However, no matter which effect is stronger, outside firms always favor an upstream merger, because for any given level of synergy, a downstream merger is more effective at curbing the inside retail price than an upstream merger. In addition, our results suggest that if the vertical supply chain partner reacts strategically, then when two downstream retailers merge, the upstream suppliers will try to reduce the negative effect of downstream merger-generated market power by lowering their prices. In contrast, when two upstream suppliers merge, the downstream retailers will pass the market power effect on to the final consumer. As a result, both inside and outside retail prices are higher in an upstream merger. So, consumer surplus and social welfare are both lower in an upstream than in a downstream merger.

@&#SUMMARY@&#


                        Deneckere and Davidson (1985) point out that under price competition, post-merger market power induces merging firms to absorb a negative externality that results in a price increase for non-merging rivals. We similarly find that in a bilateral supply chain, even when upstream or downstream supply chain partners react to the merger strategically, a merger is still able to benefit all of the firms in the merging industry. However, this is not the case if the synergy effect is present and is stronger than the market power effect. No matter at what level a merger occurs, the synergy effect always leads to a reduction in price and profit for non-merging firms. Our results confirm the findings of Cho (2013) that the market power effect of an upstream merger causes downstream prices to rise, whereas the synergy effect of an upstream merger induces downstream prices to fall. However, different from Cho (2013) and other studies, we show that under Bertrand price competition with exclusive supply chains, (i) when downstream retailers merge and get market power, this is harmful for their own suppliers but good for other suppliers; (ii) when downstream retailers merge and get synergistic benefits, the effect is just the opposite; (iii) when two effects of an upstream merger interact, under certain conditions, the market power effect dominates the synergy effect even if the cost reduction is high; and (iv) when two effects of a downstream merger interact, market power has the strongest effect on the upstream inside supplier and the weakest effect on downstream merging retailers, while post-merger synergy has the strongest effect on downstream merging retailers and the weakest effect on upstream inside suppliers.

To check the robustness of our findings, in this section, we extend our analysis to three scenarios: (i) a model with intra-brand competition, (ii) a model with sharing supply chain partners, and (iii) the effect of simultaneous upstream and downstream mergers.

In previous sections, we assume that vertical supply chains are exclusive, i.e., each supplier uses only one downstream retailer for the distribution of its product and each retailer only sells one product. It could also be the case that there exists an intra-brand competition among retailers. For example, Ziss (1995) presents a case where a downstream merger results in a multi-outlet retail monopoly and leaves the upstream stage intact as a duopoly. In what follows, we relax the assumption of exclusive supply chains and extend our analysis to a more general market structure. Specifically, we consider a bilateral market with non-exclusive supply chains in which each upstream supplier uses two retailers for distribution, and each retailer carries two products from different suppliers.

Suppose in a bilateral market with non-exclusive supply chains, each supplier uses two different retailers for the distribution of its products, i.e., supplier S1 sells its products through retailers R1 and R2, supplier S2 through R2 and R3, and supplier S3 through R3 and R1. Then, each downstream retailer chooses the retail prices for both products carried. Similar to Ziss (1995), we define the inverse demand functions for each product as follows:

                         refer to the price and demand for product i sold by retailer j, γ captures the degree of substitutability for different products sold by the same retailer and β captures the degree of substitutability for different products sold by different retailers. For the same product sold by different retailers, we assume that the price elasticity of demand is identical. In addition, we assume β < γ < 1, which implies that products are differentiated, and that the retail price is more sensitive to the prices of different products in the same store than those of different products in different retail stores.

We first examine the effect of merger-induced market power in non-exclusive vertical supply chains. Suppose suppliers S1 and S2 merge and maximize their joint profit after the merger. In the upstream industry, the post-merger structure is analogous to the case with exclusive supply chains: there are two inside merging suppliers and one outside non-merging supplier. In the downstream industry, the post-merger structure is different from the previous model: in an exclusive supply chain, two inside retailers sell products for two merging suppliers and one outside retailer sells products for a non-merging supplier; in a non-exclusive supply chain with intra-brand competition, only retailer R2 carries products for both merging suppliers, and retailers R1 and R3 both carry one product for the merging suppliers and another product from the non-merging supplier. In short, there is one inside retailer and two outside retailers after an upstream merger. The market structure is illustrated in the left side of Fig. 3
                           . As for the downstream merger case, we suppose that retailers R1 and R2 merge and maximize their profits, then in the downstream industry there are two inside merging retailers and an outside non-merging retailer. In the upstream industry, there is one inside supplier S1 selling products through the merging retailers and two outside suppliers S2 and S3 selling through one of the merging retailers and the non-merging retailer. The market structure is illustrated in the right side of Fig. 3.

As the analysis proceeds similarly to that in section 4, we summarise the results in Table 4
                            and highlight the differences between the two models. Consistent with the previous results in exclusive supply chains, the greater market power following a horizontal merger results in an increase in both upstream and downstream prices. Merging firms benefit from greater market power at the expense of their supply chain partners and the consumers. In an upstream merger case, the non-merging supplier benefits while all the downstream retailers suffer a loss. In a downstream merger case, the non-merging retailer and upstream outside suppliers benefit, while the upstream inside supplier suffers. Both consumer surplus and social welfare decrease after an upstream or a downstream merger.

Comparing the results to those of the previous model, there are two differences in this model: (i) In an upstream merger, all downstream retailers suffer a loss. (ii) The downstream merger is more detrimental to consumers and society than an upstream merger. The underlying reason behind these different results is that when we relax the exclusive supply chain assumption, the main effect of intra-brand competition among retailers is on the downstream industry. If it is an upstream merger, the effect of market power is not directly on the downstream firms, and the intra-brand competition lessens the positive externality effect on outside retailers. Therefore, all downstream retailers suffer a loss. On the other hand, because the downstream merging retailers gain more advantage with intra-brand competition, they are able to charge higher prices and reduce the welfare more than in an upstream merger.

We next examine the individual effect of post-merger synergy under intra-brand competition. Similar to the previous model, we suppose that merging firms achieve operational synergies but do not gain greater market power after a merger. In the upstream merger case, we assume that suppliers S1 and S2 merge. Based on the market structure, downstream retailer R2 is the inside retailer selling products for both merging suppliers, while retailers R1 and R3 are outside retailers selling one product for one merging supplier and another product for a non-merging supplier. We compare the pre- and post-merger results in Table 5
                           .

In summary, when we allow for intra-brand competition, most of the effects of post-merger synergy are similar to the previous case. The main two differences from our base model with exclusive supply chains are that i) under intra-brand competition, post-merger synergy improves the profit for all firms in a merger’s upstream or downstream industry; and ii) a downstream merger is more preferable to consumers and society than an upstream one. There are two reasons for these differences. First, the non-exclusive supply chain structure enables all upstream suppliers or downstream retailers to connect with the merging firms, and thereby gain the benefits of cost efficiency generated by the merger. Second, under intra-brand competition, downstream post-merger synergy results in a more noticeable difference in retail prices for the same product than upstream synergy, which allows more customers to buy the same product at a lower price.

Generally, in the non-exclusive supply chain structure, downstream competition is more intense and retail prices are lower than those in exclusive supply chains. The individual effects of post-merger market power and synergy are quite opposite, but similar to the case with exclusive supply chains. Therefore, one would expect that when two effects interact, the changes in pricing strategy will depend on which effect is stronger. Because the dominant effects are sensitive to the values of the parameters, such as cs, cr, β, γ and δ, and we provided a comparable analysis in the previous section, we skip the analysis for the sake of brevity.

To check the robustness of our results, we also relax the assumption of one-to-one supply chain structure and allow two merging firms to share supply chain partners after a horizontal merger. Specifically, we assume that if two suppliers S1 and S2 merge, then they will sell their products through both inside retailers R1 and R2 after the upstream merger. In equilibrium, we find that the results are the same as we have shown in Section 4.1. Similarly, if two retailers R1 and R2 merge and both sell two products from both inside suppliers S1 and S2, then the equilibrium results are equivalent to those derived in Section 4.2.

As another possible extension to our base model, we consider a case where there are simultaneous upstream and downstream mergers. Note that, in theory, they can be treated as two separate horizontal mergers, and we only need to look at what happened after the second merger. To investigate the effects of simultaneous mergers in our model, we assume that two suppliers S1 and S2 merge in the upstream industry, two retailers R1 and R2 merge in the downstream industry, and the supplier S3 and the retailer R3 maximize their individual profits after simultaneous mergers. Comparing the results to those of the previous model, we find that the effects of simultaneous mergers are consistent with the aggregate effects of an upstream and a downstream horizontal merger. In general, simultaneous mergers with a greater market power reduce the profit of all inside suppliers and retailers but increase the profit of both non-merging supplier and retailer, whereas simultaneous mergers with synergies have contrary effects on all the suppliers and retailers. We omit details in the interest of brevity.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper explores the effects of an upstream and a downstream horizontal merger on merging firms, non-merging competitors, vertical supply chain partners, final consumers and society as a whole, in a bilateral supply chain environment. We explore the theoretical underpinnings of merger-induced market power and operational synergies. Traditional economic theory suggests that a merger raises prices if it does not generate synergies, and considerable economies of scale are required for a merger to lower prices. Taking into consideration that upstream or downstream firms will react to a merger strategically, we show that the two forces have markedly different effects on every firm’s post-merger strategy.

The contribution of our paper to the literature is threefold. First, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of a horizontal merger from an individual firm’s perspective, including the merging firms, a non-merging competitor, a merging firm’s upstream or downstream supply chain partner and a non-merging competitor’s supply chain partner. We show that for both an upstream and a downstream horizontal merger, the effects of market power benefit all firms in the merging industry. In the merging firms’ upstream or downstream industry, mergers reduce the profit for directly related supply chain partners but increase the profit for unrelated suppliers or retailers. This result suggests that knowing that the non-merging firms will benefit from reduced competition and higher profits, their supply chain partners will adjust their strategies accordingly to take advantage of the non-merging rival’s increased market demand. Then, we show that if a merger only generates synergy without greater market power, then both upstream and downstream related supply chain partners benefit from the merger, while non-merging firms and their supply chain partners all suffer a loss in market demand and profit. As a result, vertical partners adjust their pricing strategies to reduce their losses. These results imply that if a firm in the merging industry benefits from the merger, then its supply chain partner will try to take advantage of the benefits, and this reaction is harmful to the firm; conversely, if a firm in the merging industry suffers from the merger, then its supply chain partner will try to help reduce the loss for the whole supply chain. When both market power and synergy effects exist, firms will adjust their strategy depending on which effect is stronger.

Second, we provide policy implications for antitrust authorities. Our results suggest that with the market power effect, an upstream merger is more detrimental to consumers and society as a whole than a downstream merger, while given the same degree of synergy, both an upstream and a downstream merger can be equally beneficial for consumers and society. When there is intra-brand competition among retailers with mixed supply chain, we find that upstream merger-induced market power lessens the negative effect on retailers and yields less detrimental effects on consumers and society, while the effect of post-merger synergy in a downstream merger is more beneficial. Therefore, antitrust authorities should take into account the effects of a horizontal merger, not only on the merging industry, but also on the upstream and downstream market before deciding whether to challenge a merger.

Finally, this paper contributes to the operations management literature by analyzing the effects of horizontal mergers in vertically related industries. We provide equilibrium solutions and qualitative results for mergers in a bilateral supply chain system, and also compare the different effects of an upstream and a downstream merger from a welfare perspective. To derive the closed-form expression of post-merger outcomes, we assume deterministic demand and costs. Nonetheless, we conjecture that our results would remain valid if demand uncertainty or cost uncertainty is relatively small, because they are generally consistent with those in Banal-Estañol and Ottaviani (2006) and Zhou (2008). Clearly, there are opportunities to extend our analysis by considering a more general demand or cost functions. Some other future research directions could include heterogeneous production costs, the opportunity for entry and the effects of operational levers such as inventory, lot-size and capacity. Moreover, it would be interesting to analyze the effect of operational synergy in a vertical merger case.
