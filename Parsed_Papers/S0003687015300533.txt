                  This paper highlights a preference evaluation methodology for text entry methods in a touch keyboard smartphone using analytic network process (ANP). Evaluation of text entry methods in literature mainly considers speed and accuracy. This study presents an alternative means for selecting text entry method that considers user preference. A case study was carried out with a group of experts who were asked to develop a selection decision model of five text entry methods. The decision problem is flexible enough to reflect interdependencies of decision elements that are necessary in describing real-life conditions. Results showed that QWERTY method is more preferred than other text entry methods while arrangement of keys is the most preferred criterion in characterizing a sound method. Sensitivity analysis using simulation of normally distributed random numbers under fairly large perturbation reported the foregoing results reliable enough to reflect robust judgment. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a multi-criteria decision approach in the preference evaluation of text entry methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Amplified market competition and the rapid progress of mobile technology enable advanced applications such as web browsing, electronic mail messaging, gaming, computing and advanced media services to be incorporated with the basic call and text messaging services in mobile phones. With the increasing number of functions in a phone maintaining an acceptable level of usability is a constant challenge. While product-related design requirements (e.g. basic requirements, physical characteristics, technical features) are widely studied in usability literature, user-related criteria (e.g. functionality, brand choice, customer excitement) are equally considered as part of design decisions (Isiklar and Buyukozkan, 2007).

In designing mobile phones the choice of text entry method is crucial for efficiency and satisfaction of the users. Latest designs of mobile phones allow users to select the preferred text entry method. The choice of method is relevant for creating text messages and other auxiliary services such as searching on the internet, calendar entries, tweeting and other social media. Text messages using SMS that are sent daily are known to be at the order of 1 × 1012 (Bin, 2006). In the Asian region, text messaging draws its success in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines (Balakrishnan and Yeow, 2008). This motivated a vast area of research in mobile text entry over the years (Dunlop and Masters, 2008).

Design issues in the area of text entry method include input speed, accuracy, physical form, learning time and cost (Green et al., 2004). Koivisto and Urbaczewski (2005) claimed that these issues could be grouped into two types of usability measurements: performance measurements and preference measurements. The former gathers quantifiable metrics to measure system performance typically that of speed and accuracy while the latter explores subjective preferences and opinion data, which may include physical form or aesthetics, learning time and cost that vary with individual judgments. While performance measurements provide quantifiable basis in design decisions, preference measurements are hardly explored due to the subjectivity of end-users' decision-making despite of their relevance in evaluation (Isiklar and Buyukozkan, 2007). When preference measurements become relevant in design decisions, several criteria must be brought into context. Preference evaluation is highly associated with user experience (UX) evaluation that encompasses user's interaction with a product including perception, feelings, and thoughts (Albert and Tullis, 2013). Furthermore, this is also related to the satisfaction dimensions emphasized by international standards (ISO, 1997) that require subjective measures. MacKenzie and Soukoreff (2002) highlight the importance of preference or subjective measures in addressing broad but highly relevant issues in loosely generated answers. However, MacKenzie and Soukoreff (2002) caution that unless qualitative analyses pass through rigorous empirical validation, results may fail to be reproducible and generalizable. Most scholars tend to construct statistical analyses in exploring preference measurement studies. For instance, Hsiao et al. (2014) provided an empirical evaluation of four miniature keyboards by way of measuring objective and subjective rating using statistical analysis. These intangible issues, such as comfort, ease of use, subjective impression, are often multi-dimensional and qualitative which definitely pose difficulty and complexity in the evaluation process.

This work highlights a methodology in evaluating text entry methods in mobile phones in the context of preference measurements. Since such evaluation requires multiple criteria such as distance between keys, arrangement of keys, number of keys, sizes of keys, popularity and familiarity of users, with inherent interrelationships, a multi-criteria decision method (MCDM) was used. MCDM had been used as methodology in mobile text entry research in particular (Hsiao, 1998; Lin and Hwang, 1999; Isiklar and Buyukozkan, 2007; Chen et al., 2009; Delice and Gungor, 2009; Hsiao et al., 2010). Current approaches in performance evaluation of text entry methods published in literature typically involve the use of Fitts' law (Fitts, 1954), and in some cases an extended Fitts' law that incorporates Hick-Hyman law (Kim and Myung, 2013), to explore speed performance of a method. On the other hand, accuracy performance evaluations rely on the minimum string distance (MSD) method (Koivisto and Urbaczewski, 2005; Soukoreff and MacKenzie, 2001) and the keystroke classification method (KSM) (Koivisto and Urbaczewski, 2005). When speed and accuracy are incorporated with preference measures such as popularity and familiarity of users, little is known on how to integrate objective and subjective results. For instance, the evaluation of Hsiao et al. (2014) using both objective and subjective measures offers separate analysis on these two measures and lacks an aggregated measure that best describes the overall evaluation. Furthermore, exploring the interrelationships of these criteria present in real-life scenario, to our knowledge, has not been accomplished in current literature.

This paper aims to present a platform for evaluation that captures objective and subjective criteria in a robust and reliable process. This study attempts to develop a decision framework which is sufficiently general that could be applied to other evaluations with similar settings. This preference evaluation is significant to fill in our understanding on the role of subjective measurements on the selection of text entry methods. Consequently, gaining insights on these measurements is fundamental to both researchers and practitioners. The contribution of this study is on evaluating text entry methods in the presence of subjective measures in a multi-criteria decision context.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

As mobile phones converge to touch screen designs and virtual keypads (Park and Han, 2010), various text entry methods are introduced in the market such as the multitap (M), multitap with disambiguation (MD), qwerty keypad (QW) and handwriting recognition (HR) (Curran et al., 2006). In multitap, one must press one to four times to obtain the desired character. For instance, one must press the number 8 three times for the letter “v” to appear on screen. Such method is relatively slow compared to other input methods. This method on average requires 2.034 keystrokes per character when entering English text (MacKenzie, 2003).

A slightly developed version of Multitap is the T9 technique for disambiguation (MacKenzie, 2003). In this method, users press once on the number representing the letter of interest. The T9 technique then displays the word or words which appropriate the sequence of letters being pressed based on the frequently used words in the English language. It minimizes the number of keystrokes required for a given word compared to the traditional Multitap. However, one shortcoming of the T9 technique is the possibility of appearance of more than one word that goes with the text. T9 technique does not also recognize other languages except the English language.

QWERTY designs, on the other hand, mimic and miniaturize desktop computer keyboards. Keys are pressed once for the desired character. This makes QWERTY performance fast. However, compared to Multitap, QWERTY has more number of keys to display on screen, which naturally reduced key sizes. As such, users have a tendency to make mistakes by tapping on adjacent keys.

Designers had also explored handwriting as text input in order to give more freedom to the user. There are two types of handwriting recognition: the clustered handwriting and the free handwriting. These handwriting recognition styles are embedded in a number of smartphones distributed worldwide (e.g. Samsung™ smartphones). In the clustered handwriting, the keypad is clustered into 4 boxes as in Fig. 1
                        a.

Users write in the upper two boxes (left-hand and short-hand) for alpha texts. The strokes of the letters must be similar to the forms of the texts for them to be recognized. The box in the lower left is used to write numbers in the text. Lastly, the lower right box is used to present symbols and punctuation marks. It is assumed that users are familiar with the forms and keystrokes of the letters, numbers and symbols in using this handwriting style. On the other hand, the free handwriting style is similar to the clustered handwriting but users have to tick an icon beside the handwriting box to select the writing mode. Users can choose between alpha mode, numeric mode and symbolic mode. A sample of the free handwriting recognition style is shown in Fig. 1b. The big box in the lower left represents the input box with the mode on the lower-left side of the box. Users can change the mode from alpha to numeric, alpha to symbolic, numeric to alpha, numeric to symbolic, and vice versa. Users input the keystrokes in the input box and then the transcribed text will be shown.

Among these five text entry methods discussed, current literature focuses on Multitap and QWERTY (Green et al., 2004; Nesbat, 2003; Pavlovych and Stuerzlinger, 2004; Karlson et al., 2006; Balakrishnan and Yeow, 2008). Green et al. (2004) developed a reduced QWERTY keyboard for mobile text entry and Nesbat (2003) developed a rearrangement of multitap design based on the frequency of usage of any particular letter in the English language. There are studies comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of the two input methods. Nesbat (2003) argued that the Multitap system for text entry is neither efficient nor user-friendly. Pavlovych and Stuerzlinger (2004) presented a model for text entry speed of a multitap system. Karlson et al. (2006) claimed that many preferred to use Multitap than QWERTY. Balakrishnan and Yeow (2008) also found out that Multitap is relatively slower than QWERTY. Thus, contradicting reports are observed in current literature on the performances of these two methods using speed and accuracy criteria. This paper attempts to resolve this contradiction by extending through other relevant criteria such as embedded physical attributes and popularity of the method and familiarity of the users.

The search for a suitable text entry method cannot be done without considering usability and user experience metrics. Albert and Tullis (2013) distinguished usability from user experience (UX) in terms of scope and methods. Usability focuses on the ability of the user to accomplish tasks while UX encompasses the totality of the user's interaction with a product including perception, feelings, and thoughts. Vermeeren et al. (2010) consider usability as a part of the bigger concept of UX that focuses more on quantifiable performance metrics. UX, on the other hand, is more subjective. Methods used in UX studies gather both qualitative and quantitative data.

International standards of usability specified three dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction (ISO, 1997). The concept of effectiveness in usability was operationally defined as being better than a specified level of performance (Shackel, 1986) or the completeness by which users achieve certain goals (Frokjaer et al., 2000). It can be expressed quantitatively by measuring rate of error or proportion of users that are able to accomplish a certain task. Accuracy in text entry is crucial and is an important aspect of usability. Two evaluation metrics are established in literature. First is the Minimum String Distance (MSD) (Koivisto and Urbaczewski, 2005; Soukoreff and MacKenzie, 2001) and the Keystroke Classification Method (KSM) (Koivisto and Urbaczewski, 2005). MSD is derived from an algorithm that measures the minimum distance of two strings given editing primitives such as insertion, deletion and substitution. See Koivisto and Urbaczewski (2005) for detailed discussion of the two metrics. From these two accuracy performance metrics, Koivisto and Urbaczewski (2005) proposed KSM as a more effective tool when comparing text entry input devices.

Efficiency is another a usability attribute that focuses on the productivity of the user (Nielsen, 1993). This is the reason most efficiency measures quantify the time that a user takes to complete a task and learning time (Frokjaer et al., 2000). In text entry literature, efficiency is generally considered very important because it allows the user to accomplish the task at minimum time. Fitts developed a generally accepted theory that movement time depends on task's difficulty (Fitts, 1954; Fitts and Peterson, 1964). Fitts' law was not derived mathematically but was developed from an analogy on Shanon's Theorem 17 comparing human motor system as a communications channel where human movement can be viewed as the transmission of signals and the spatial accuracy of the move can be treated as an electronic noise.


                        Nielsen (1993) defined satisfaction as pleasure derived from using the system and liking it. This aspect of usability is the one directly related to UX as it is subjective and related to feelings. Subjective measures are usually employed in evaluating satisfaction and are usually obtained from questionnaires or user observations (Rubin, 1994). The more difficult part of subjective measurement, however, is conducting close observation of subjects' facial expression and keeping track of their comments, which are critical design inputs. Subtle remarks and movements of the face can be very informative in assessing a subject's overall evaluation of the product.

Preference evaluations of text entry methods are seldom explored in literature although it is an integral aspect in mobile phone design. As such there is difficulty in developing robust test instruments that are bound to ensure accuracy, relevance, reproducibility and generalizability of results (MacKenzie and Soukoreff, 2002). Criticisms are often pointed out regarding qualitative results that came from anecdote or testimonials without empirical support (MacKenzie and Soukoreff, 2002).

When users choose text entry methods, judgments do not always rely on speed and accuracy performance but also on some subjective measures such as popularity and familiarity. While it is difficult for design decisions to bank on subjective judgments because of the variability of biases among users, the presence of expert judgments could mitigate biases and provide insightful information (Saaty, 2008). Generally, experts are those who have experienced and understood the complexities regarding use and design of text entry methods. These experts generally ought to provide valuable insights based from the fact that their judgments are treated to have precedence over judgments of those who know less (Saaty, 2008). We posit that expert judgments are necessary in advancing understanding of design issues of text entry methods. The results of such judgments would be authoritative and important enough to observe how preference evaluations impact the selection of text entry methods. The details of the decision-making process could provide insights on how users prioritize and aggregate value judgments on several decision areas in choosing a text entry method. While design information at present is gained primarily from performance evaluations, this study explores the impact of preference judgments of expert users as inputs in design.

Preference evaluation is considered a selection decision problem with components that are subjective and unquantifiable. Thus, a multi-criteria decision method (MCDM) is appropriate for such analysis. MCDM had been used in several usability studies. Delice and Gungor (2009) explored website usability problems using heuristic evaluation and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Heuristic evaluation was used to identify usability problems and AHP to judge severity of the problems. Hsiao et al. (2010) proposed a model using AHP and quantification theory that characterizes psychological perception of consumers on different product styles. Hsiao (1998) proposed a fuzzy decision-making method for selecting optimum product design from a number of design alternatives. Işiklar and Büyüközkan (2007) used AHP and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate mobile phone options subject to different criteria. Most desirable features which affect the choice of phone were identified. In this work, an analytic network process (ANP) is used because of its capability of handling decision problems that are complex with interrelating components. ANP is the most suitable tool for solving interdependence problems among evaluation criteria and attributes (Saaty, 1996). Hence, this study attempts to apply ANP in selecting text entry method by forming an evaluation model gathered from expert users and then eliciting judgments based on the decision structure.

Analytic network process is the general method of analyzing complex decision problems wherein Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a special case (Saaty, 1980). The significance of ANP/AHP in handling multi-criteria decision-making problems lies on its three basic features: modeling system's complexity, measuring on a ratio scale and synthesizing as presented by Promentilla et al. (2008) in Table 1
                        .

Local priorities, which reflect the priority of a given element on its influence on other element in the same or different decision component, in ANP are computed in a way similar to how local priorities in AHP are established based on pairwise comparisons and judgments. In ANP, the decision problem is structured as a network of decision components. This is accomplished by introducing interactions or interrelationships among decision components which transformed into a network in which they dominate or be dominated, directly or indirectly, by other decision components. One advantage of using ANP is its capability of capturing both qualitative and quantitative criteria in an analytical decision model and also allowing interrelationships with each decision components. The details of the methodology of the ANP are discussed in various works including Saaty (2008). Thus, this work does not intend to discuss thoroughly the methodology. It is highly recommended to read Promentilla et al. (2008) for a well-presented discussion of the methodology particularly on structuring a supermatrix from a given decision network.

The input to the supermatrix of a hierarchical network depends on the presence and type of dependence described in a digraph. The eigenvector method is one of the popular methods used to quantify the relative dominance of the elements from pairwise comparison matrices. Saaty (1980) proposed the following eigenvalue formulation to obtain the desired ratio-scale priority vector (or weights) w of n elements:
                           
                              (1)

                                          max
                                       
                                    
                                    w
                                 
                              
                           
                        where A is the positive reciprocal pairwise comparisons matrix, λmax is the maximum (or principal) eigenvalue of the matrix A. λmax can be solved using the following expressions:

Equation (4) would result into a polynomial of λ to the degree n and the largest root of the polynomial is the λmax. For consistent judgment, λmax = n, otherwise, λmax > n. The measure of consistency of judgment is measured through the Consistency Index (CI) and Consistency Ratio (CR). The Consistency Index (CI), as a measure of degree of consistency, was calculated using the formula

                        where RI is the mean random consistency index (see Alonso and Lamata (2006) for Tables of RI). Acceptable CR values must be less than 0.1. Decision-makers were asked to repeat the pairwise comparisons for CR values greater than 0.1.

Global priority ratio scales or priorities can be obtained based on the synthesizing concept of the supermatrix. By raising the matrix to large powers, the transmission of influence along all possible paths defined in the decision structure is captured in the process (Saaty, 2001). The convergence of initial priorities (stochastic matrix) to an equilibrium value in the limit supermatrix provides a set of meaningful synthesized priorities from the underlying decision structure (Promentilla et al., 2008). Saaty (2001) assured that as long as the supermatrix representation is a primitive irreducible matrix in a strongly connected digraph, the initial supermatrix must converge to a limit supermatrix. Promentilla et al. (2008) discussed that the limit supermatrix denoted by L exists when the initial supermatrix is standardized by its principal eigenvalue as shown by the equation:

Each column of the limit supermatrix is a unique positive column eigenvector associated with the principal eigenvalue λmax. (Promentilla et al., 2008). This principal column eigenvector corresponds to the stable priorities from the limit supermatrix and can be used to measure the overall relative dominance of one element over another in a hierarchical network structure (Promentilla et al., 2006).

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

An expert group consisting of ten members was formed to evaluate five text entry methods in a touch keyboard smartphone. Ten members were chosen in order to be consistent with several studies in MCDM (e.g. Tseng et al., 2009, Tseng and Chiu, 2013). The group was composed of usability experts and end users who have extensive experience in using all text entry methods for at least five years and have explored them rigorously. The group consisted three usability experts and seven expert users with ample experience and orientation on the use of the five text entry methods. These members were invited for a focus group discussion and were informed of their role in formulating a decision problem and eliciting judgments from this problem.

The evaluation method using ANP followed these steps:
                           
                              1.
                              The focus group discussion is carried out in two parts. The first part elicited the criteria for selecting a text entry method. Prior to this step, members were informed on specific text entry methods under evaluation. Each one was asked to justify the inclusion of such criterion in the selection process. The group must reach a consensus as to whether a criterion enumerated by a member should be included in the model. Thus, the output of the first part is a list of criteria. The second part involved structuring a decision problem with goal, criteria and alternatives. Members were asked to provide necessary relationships of each decision component that could be explained from theory or practice. The output of this step was a decision problem of selecting a text entry method.

Based from the decision problem, pairwise comparison matrices were formed. The group was asked to elicit judgments on these matrices by making pairwise comparisons of a set of elements with respect to an element that influences the given set of elements. For instance, an arc that emanates from goal to criteria requires comparing pairwise elements in the criteria with respect to the goal. An example of a pairwise comparison is: Comparing first criteria and second criteria, which one is more preferable with respect to having a “good text entry method and by how much?” Comparisons are populated using Saaty's Fundamental Scale (Saaty, 1980) as shown in Table 2
                                 .

Local priority vector of each matrix is obtained using Equation (1) and consistencies of judgment elicitation are computed using Equations (5) and (6). The output of this step is a set of local priority vectors that will be later populated in the supermatrix.
                           
                              3.
                              Form the initial supermatrix based from the decision problem obtained in step 1. Then populate this initial supermatrix with the local priority vectors obtained in step 2. Local vectors are plugged in their appropriate position in the supermatrix. Applying Equation (7), initial supermatrix must be transformed into a column stochastic matrix with column sums equal to unity. This is done by dividing each entry in a specific column with the sum of that column. Finally, compute the limiting weight vector or the global priority vector by raising the column stochastic matrix to large powers.

Analyze the global priority vector by separating it and normalizing per decision component. Thus prioritization of elements is done for each component. The order of elements of each component represents the level of significance of each element in the component. The ranking of elements in the alternatives component denotes the preferred text entry methods in decreasing order.

For a robust decision, conduct sensitivity analysis using simulation that treats rating scales in the pairwise comparisons matrices as random variables in a normal probability distribution. The sensitivity analysis performed in this paper is highly motivated from the procedure introduced by Hauser and Tadikamalla (1996).

A selection decision problem was formulated to evaluate the preferences of experts of five text entry methods: multitap (M), multitap with T9 (MT9), QWERTY (Q), the clustered handwriting style (CH) and free handwriting style (FH). The test smartphone used in this case is the GT-S5570 Samsung Galaxy Mini with Android technology. This model allows users to switch from one text entry method to other methods. This capability is present in other latest models of smartphones manufactured by leading brands. The goal of the decision problem is to select a “good text entry method”. A focus group was formed to identify relevant criteria for evaluation. The criteria have the nature of complex dependence relationships. Thus, the group was asked to develop a selection decision model as shown in Fig. 2
                        . For instance, familiarity (FM) is enhanced by arrangement of keys (AK) and number of keys (NK) making ANP an appropriate tool to be applied. The group was also asked to provide brief description of these criteria. Table 3
                         provides a brief description of criteria together with the goal and alternatives.

The group was then asked to structure the selection decision problem by showing necessary interrelationships among components and elements in a component. The selection problem is modeled in Fig. 2.

The selection problem is motivated by the hierarchical network in Fig. 2. The group introduced these dependence relations based from their experiences and logical reasoning. For instance, distance between keys (DK) is influenced by itself, and other criteria such as arrangement of keys (AK), number of keys (NK) and sizes of keys (SK). Suppose that a given smartphone has a fixed keyboard area, thus, distance between keys depends on the arrangement, number and sizes of keys. Arrangement of keys depends on distance and number of keys. When number and distances of keys change, corresponding arrangement which implies another text entry method evolves. Large number of keys means that distances between keys are minimized and arrangement is changed. It follows from the argument that sizes of keys depend on number and distances between keys. The expert group argues that users tend to familiarize faster a particular method when good arrangement of keys and minimal number of keys are achieved. Lastly, popularity of a particular method is largely influenced by some other external criteria, at least by the criteria described in this work.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The results of the empirical study conducted is shown to illustrate a multi-criteria preference evaluation of five text entry methods using ANP. The results obtained by the group of experts are shown in the succeeding sections.
                        
                           1.
                           Judgment elicitation using pairwise comparison matrices was done using Saaty's fundamental scale. For brevity, we could not show here all pairwise comparisons matrices but we just presented representative matrices from a dependence relation. For instance, Table 4
                               shows pairwise comparisons of the influence of criteria to the goal. A sample question asked was: “Comparing distance between keys (DK) and arrangement of keys (AK), which one is more preferable with respect to good text entry method, and by how much?” The intensity of 1/6 shown in the first row second column of Table 4 implies that AK is more important than DK by a factor of 6.

A second sample matrix is shown in Table 5
                      which shows the influence of alternatives to criteria. A sample question asked was: “Comparing Multitap (M) and Multitap with T9 (MT9), which one characterizes distance between keys (DK), and by how much?”. A third sample matrix is presented in Table 6
                      which shows sample pairwise comparisons of criteria with respect to an alternative. A sample question in Table 6 was asked like this: “Comparing distance between keys (DK) and arrangement of keys (AK), which one is more of a characteristic of Multitap (M), and by how much?” Lastly, a sample matrix in Table 7
                      shows a sample of pairwise comparisons of criteria with respect to other criterion. A sample question being asked was: “Comparing distance between keys (DK) and arrangement of keys (AK), which one dominates distance between keys (DK), and by how much?”

The relative importance of each element as shown in the eigenvector column of each pairwise comparison matrix is computed using Equation (7), also known as the eigenvector method (Saaty, 1980, 1996; 2001). For instance in Table 4, the eigenvector of comparing criteria pairwise with respect to the goal is [0.05374, 0.38796, 0.26460, 0.08510, 0.15966, 0.04894]T which means that arrangement of keys (AK) influences most a “good text entry method” compared to other criteria because it has the largest value. In the process of doing pairwise comparisons, the consistency index (CI) is monitored and the group is advised to adjust their ratio scales in case CI exceeds tolerable value. Recorded CI values for all matrices in this study range from 0 to 0.9372 which satisfies Saaty's recommended value of CI < 0.10 (Saaty, 1980).
                        
                           2.
                           The supermatrix in Table 8
                               is populated with the priority vectors obtained from pairwise comparisons matrices. To facilitate discussion, we introduce components A, B, C to denote goal, evaluation criteria and alternatives, respectively. The row vector (1, 1, 1, …, 1) in blocks AA, AB and AC denotes coherence of criteria and alternatives to the goal. Coherence ensures that the decision does not deviate from the goal. Block BA shows how criteria influence goal. Block BB represents the interrelationships among criteria. Block BC shows the influence of criteria to alternatives. Block CA is a null vector because of the absence of an arc emanating from goal to alternative component. In practical application, this is relevant because text entry method is not developed simply for having a good text entry method. It is developed in a way that satisfies a set of criteria. This relationship is shown in block CB. Finally, block CC presents the interrelationships among alternatives. Finally, in obtaining the final priority vector, the column stochastic matrix in Table 9
                               is raised to large powers until it converges to a limit or the Cesaro sum (Saaty, 1996, 2001). Convergence can be observed if column values are identical as shown in Table 10
                              . Each column of the limiting supermatrix is the global eigenvector of the matrix which reflects the priority of each element as a result of the interdependencies among elements.

Priority ranking of elements is done per component. Two methods are available for priority ranking. Distributive ranking is done by normalizing the eigenvector in a column while ideal ranking is done by dividing the eigenvector by the highest priority value of the same component. Table 11
                               shows the two ranking methods.

In order to show that the results do not come from whimsical judgment, a sensitivity analysis was carried. The process of conducting such analysis is similar and is adopted from the work of Hauser and Tadikamalla (1996). The central idea is to simulate the effect of perturbations of judgment brought about by uncertainty of decision-making. Simulation is done at the level of eliciting paired comparisons. Although the work of Hauser and Tadikamalla (1996) was conducted in the framework of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), we show that such process strengthens the results of the ANP, as described in this work.

In this work, sensitivity analysis starts by determining the return of a normal probability distribution from randomly generated probabilities with mean equal to the numerical value elicited by the focus group in the previous section and with standard deviation forced to be 25% about the mean. The value of 25% is accepted to capture fairly large perturbation of judgment. A normally generated judgment can be represented by

Given p = 0.25, which indicates fairly large (but not too large) perturbations of judgment, the composite of 50 simulation runs is shown in Table 12

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Based on the case study conducted, the goal was influenced mostly by the arrangement of keys (AK), number of keys (NK) and familiarity (FM) of users. Users simultaneously consider the arrangement and number of keys and then estimate the amount of time for them to familiarize the method. NK and AK are two closely related criteria as evidenced by the degree of priority they have on each other which means that changing the number of keys also changes the priority of the arrangement of keys. This complexity is brought about by the dependence relations of these elements. Note that when the design area is fixed; increasing the number of keys minimizes the distances between keys (DK) and sizes of keys (SK). Thus, SK is influenced largely by DK and vice versa. Familiarity (FM) is largely influenced by NK indicating that efficient number of keys prompts users to be familiar with the text entry method.

In designing a text entry method, least number of keys means that one has to access another key first in case characters are not on the keypad. For instance, in the multitap, one has to press symbol mode first before accessing symbols. This causes difficulty among users because one has to be careful on pressing a particular key a number of times to get into the desired character. Furthermore, switching from one keyboard type to another type, from alphabetic to numeric for instance slows down data entry rates (Sears and Zha, 2003). Results of this study show that users' judgment rested on how they could overcome this difficulty by looking at the number of keys present and how they are arranged on the keypad. This observation leads us to block CB of Table 8. In this block, QWERTY dominates number of keys (NK) which is one of the top prioritized criteria. However, it can be observed that QWERTY lacks the criterion of arrangement of keys (AK) (0.0863) which is dominated by Multitap (M) (0.2701). The results also showed that clustered handwriting (CH) and free handwriting (FH) promote higher familiarity rate compared to other methods. This is valid as these text entry methods require users to input the text on its prescribed character. Users do not need to memorize key location thus familiarity is promoted. QWERTY, on the other hand, has lower perceived familiarity rate as it ranks fourth in text entry alternatives. Further research could be directed to verify this result and to identify measurable items to measure familiarity of QWERTY.

By taking into account all interrelationships of the elements in the selection problem, the final priority vector of alternatives is known to be (Q, M, FH, MT9, CH)T = (0.2350, 0.2244, 0.2148, 0.1715, 0.1542)T which means that users prefer to use QWERTY than other text entry methods. Note that QWERTY is preferred based on the criteria of number of keys and popularity as discussed in the preceding paragraphs. However, with a small difference on the priority weight of free handwriting (FH) and multitap with T9 (MT9), users cannot completely distinguish which of the two methods is more preferable. It is surprising that MT9 ranks second to the last of priority while it is considered as a faster method compared to Multitap. This may be because of the language used by expert group in this study. MT9 handles only the English language so when users use their own dialect in communication, MT9 is less preferable. On the other hand, the final priority weights of the evaluation criteria are (AK, NK, FM, SK, DK, PP)T = (0.3071, 0.2748, 0.1437, 0.1056, 0.0981, 0.0707)T which shows that even if interrelationships are considered; there is a minimal disparity on the priority ranking of the criteria. The top three criteria include arrangement of keys (AK), number of keys (NK) and familiarity (FM) of the text entry methods. Familiarity has become an issue usability literature due to its impact of basic performance measures such as speed and accuracy. For instance, Myung (2004) developed an engineering model termed as keystroke-level model (KLM) which is based on Fitts' law that includes users' mental and physical activities (remembering numbers and visual searchers). Popularity (PP) is less considered by the participants. This means that users are not largely influenced by external commendation of peers in relation to their choice of a text entry method. Results of this paper confirm some literature claiming that QWERTY is the preferred text entry method compared to other methods (Nesbat, 2003; Balakrishnan and Yeow, 2008) but contradict with the results of Karlson et al. (2006). Furthermore, the results contradict with some of the literature claiming speed-accuracy evaluation as the sole criteria in choosing text entry method (MacKenzie and Chang, 1999; Soukoreff and MacKenzie, 2001; Zhai et al., 2002; Clawson et al., 2006; Koivisto and Urbaczewski, 2005).

Valuable insights could be gained from the preference evaluation method used in this case study.

The use of ANP advanced other subjective approaches in identifying preferences through its capability of handling subjective and objective criteria in complex relationships using a methodology with strong mathematical basis. Using expert judgments, results from the methodology are valid enough to influence credible insights from the evaluation or decision problem. This approach could be used to explore usability studies particularly related to problems that require expert human decision over a finite set of alternatives.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Text entry method is an important component of mobile phone design. Users employ various criteria for choosing a method and it is difficult to identify which of them is more important than the others. The method for preference evaluation presented in this study was able to consider multiple criteria that includes both quantitative and qualitative. The group of experts employed was able to obtain preference ranking of elements in a complex evaluation structure. The results obtain were found to be robust enough with fairly large perturbations. Thus, although the experts may have difference in judgment, the method was able to take account of these discrepancies and generate a recommendation that is reliable. Furthermore, even if some of the criteria are subjective the process of making pairwise comparisons was able to adequately identify the ranking of importance.

The proposed preference evaluation method could be applied to other usability studies that require preference evaluation. Subjective preferences of users impact selection decision when compared to previous performance evaluations. The proposed method has its capability to decompose decision problems into sufficient level of detail for us to understand the features of the decision which is the primary shortcoming of performance evaluation using speed and accuracy measures. It also captures relationships of the evaluation structure which are necessary in representing real-life preference judgments. This proposed method establishes a foundation for future research which may incorporate fuzziness and uncertainty in value judgments. Furthermore, it could be incorporated with performance evaluation methods in order to have more holistic information to researchers and practitioners in usability research.
