@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The minimax regret sink location problem was first proposed by Cheng et al. (2013) in the context of the Tohuku-Pacific Ocean Earthquake, which occurred in Japan on March 11, 2011. In general, the problem can be described as follows. We are given an undirected connected graph 
                        
                           G
                           =
                           
                              (
                              V
                              ,
                              E
                              )
                           
                           ,
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              |
                              V
                              |
                           
                           =
                           n
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              |
                              E
                              |
                           
                           =
                           m
                        
                     . Each vertex is associated with a vertex weight that is not known exactly but the interval to which it belongs is known. Each edge is associated with an edge length and an edge capacity. The edge length is the distance between the two endpoints of the edge and the edge capacity is the upper boundary for the number of weights that enter an edge per unit time. The objective is to find k(k ≥ 1) sink points on G such that all the weights are sent to one of the k sinks and the maximum regret of the evacuation time is minimized. In this case, the evacuation time usually refers to the maximum time, i.e., the time required by the last unit weight to complete evacuation.


                     Cheng et al. (2013) considered the minimax regret 1-sink location problem in a dynamic path network with a uniform edge capacity, where an O(nlog2
                     n) time algorithm was proposed for the problem. Later, Wang (2014) and Higashikawa et al. (2015) proposed two improved algorithms to address the problem, which each had a time complexity of O(nlog n). It is noteworthy that the algorithm proposed by Wang (2014) further reduced the space complexity degree of previous algorithms. Li, Xu, and Ni (2014) considered the minimax regret vertex 2-sink location problem in dynamic path networks with a uniform edge capacity, where the sinks are limited to being located on the vertex of the path, and an O(n
                     3log n) time algorithm was proposed. For a general k, Ni, Xu, and Dong (2014) proposed an 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              n

                                 k
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 (
                                 log
                                 n
                                 )
                              
                              
                                 1

                           )
                        
                      time algorithm, whereas Arumugam, Augustine, Golin, and Strikanthan (2014) proposed two algorithms for this problem. The first algorithm proposed by Arumugam et al. (2014) is better for small values of k, where it runs in O(kn
                     2(log n)
                        k
                     ), whereas the second algorithm is better for larger values of k, where it runs in O(kn
                     3log n). It is noteworthy that Arumugam et al.’s algorithm is the first polynomial time algorithm for this problem. For other networks, Higashikawa, Golin, and Katoh (2014a) considered the minimax regret 1-sink location problem in dynamic tree networks with a uniform edge capacity and they proposed an O(n
                     2log2
                     n) time algorithm. For the minimax regret 1-sink location problem in dynamic cycle networks with a uniform edge capacity, Xu and Li (2015) proposed an O(n
                     3log n) time algorithm. Bhattacharya and Kameda (2015) proposed several algorithms which improved the previous best algorithms for several minimax regret sink location problems, including an O(n) time algorithm for the minimax regret 1-sink location problem in a dynamic path network, an O(nlog n
                     4) time algorithm for the minimax regret 2-sink location problem in a dynamic path network, and an O(nlog n) time algorithm for the minimax regret 1-sink location problem in a dynamic tree network.

When the exact weight of each vertex is known, the objective of the sink location problem is to find the sink location in the given network that minimizes the evacuation time. For path networks, Higashikawa, Golin, and Katoh (2014b) solved the k-sink location problem in dynamic path networks with a uniform edge capacity in O(knlog n) time for a general k and proposed an improved algorithm with a time complexity of O(kn) (Higashikawa et al., 2014b). Tree networks have been addressed in several studies. Mamada, Makino, and Fujishige (2002) considered the vertex 1-sink location problem in a dynamic tree network with general capacities while an O(nlog2
                     n) time algorithm for this problem was proposed by Mamada, Uno, Makino, and Fujishige (2006). Higashikawa et al. (2014a) described an O(nlog n) time algorithm for the problem when the capacities are uniform. In addition, it should be mentioned that the studies of Higashikawa et al. (2014b) and Higashikawa, Golin, and Katoh (2014c) also considered a situation where the evacuation time was denoted as the total time instead of the maximum time.

If there is only one sink and the route to the sink is unique for any vertex, it is obvious that the weights on a vertex will evacuate to the sink along that unique route. If there is more than one sink or the route from a vertex to a sink is not unique, then we need to make a decision such that the evacuation solution (which includes the objective sink and the corresponding evacuation path) is defined for every vertex. In previous related studies (Arumugam et al., 2014; Bhattacharya & Kameda, 2015; Higashikawa et al., 2014b; 2014c; Li et al., 2014; Ni et al., 2014; Xu & Li, 2015), the division point is set to the optimal value, i.e., the weight of any vertex will evacuate to the sink(s) with the optimal evacuation solution, which allows the weights to evacuate to more distant sinks rather than the nearest and/or complete evacuation along a path that is not the shortest path. It is assumed that the weights on a vertex should evacuate to the same sink and we also retain this assumption in this paper. Thus, the optimal evacuation solution is the solution with the minimum evacuation time for the weights between any two neighboring sink points. However, when an emergency, such as an earthquake, occurs, people do not behave as expected during the evacuation process and they will usually evacuate to the nearest shelter via the shortest path (known as the intuitive evacuation solution) rather than evacuating according to the optimal evacuation solution. Indeed, the optimal evacuation solution might not be known when an emergency occurs.

Thus, in this paper, we consider the minimax regret sink location problem with accessibility where all of the weights are assumed to evacuate to the nearest sink via the shortest path. We consider this problem in a general network 
                        
                           G
                           =
                           
                              (
                              V
                              ,
                              E
                              )
                           
                        
                      where the number of sink points is 1. Throughout this study, we assume that each edge has a uniform edge capacity. As usual, and without loss of generality, we also assume that the undirected connected graph G contains no loops or multiple edges, i.e., the graph G is an undirected connected simple graph. Given a dynamic general network G, the weight of every vertex is known as an interval. A specific assignment of a weight to each vertex is called a scenario. The problem involves finding a point x on G as the sink point such that the maximum regret of the evacuation time should be as small as possible. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide some useful definitions and properties. In Section 3, we present an O(m

                        ), is the length of the shortest path on G from x to y. We assume that the distance between any two vertices is known. In fact, the distance matrix (which gives the distance between any two vertices) of a general graph can be obtained in O(n
                        3) time with the Floyd–Warshall algorithm. Of course, there are algorithms which are better than O(n
                        3) time and for more details please refer to Williams (2014). Since the time required to determine the distance matrix has no effect on the time complexity of our algorithm, in this paper we just assume the distance matrix is known. Because G is connected,

                        G is a tree, and thus we assume that m ≥ n in this study.

Next, we define the time required for the evacuation of all weights to x ∈ G under 
                           
                              s
                              ∈
                              S
                              ,
                           
                         i.e., T(x, s). Because there is only one sink and all of the weights are assumed to complete their evacuation along the shortest path, then the evacuation solution for every vertex is provided as long as the sink point is given. In other words, with a given sink point x, the general graph G can be viewed as a tree graph G(x) rooted at x, based on which the evacuation paths for all of the vertices are represented. For any point x, in G(x) we define the vertices adjacent to x as neighbors of x, which are denoted as Nx
                        . Thus, for a vertex vi

We assume that the weights on the sink point can complete their evacuation instantly.

We denote xopt
                        (s) as the optimum sink location under s and the corresponding evacuation time is T(xopt
                        (s), s). We define the regret of x under s as

                        ) hold, we define this scenario s as a dominant scenarios of x. With a given sink point x, we denote all the dominant scenarios of x as 
                           
                              D

                        . It is not difficult to determine that 
                           
                              D

                         comprises O(n) scenarios. The following lemma is provided.

                           Lemma 1
                           
                              For any sink point x ∈ G, there is a dominant scenario

                              such that R(x, s
                              *) ≥ R(x, s) for any

                        Lemma 1 implies that for any x ∈ G, the worst case scenario of x must be in 
                           
                              D
                              x
                           
                        . Define 
                           D
                         as the set of all the dominant scenarios we need to consider. Since the sink point x can be any point of G, we have 
                           
                              D

                                 ⋂

                                 ∣
                                 x
                                 ∈
                                 G
                                 }
                              
                           
                        .

We know that G(x) may be different for various values of x. To obtain the evacuation solution for every vertex, we must determine G(x) for any x. If we consider an edge 
                           
                              e
                              =
                              
                                 (
                                 
                                    v
                                    p
                                 
                                 ,
                                 
                                    v
                                    q
                                 
                                 )
                              
                           
                         with a given s, where the sink point x moves along the edge e from vp
                         to vq
                        , then how will G(x) and T(x, s) change? Note that for any vertex vi
                         ∈ V, the shortest path to x must be one of the following paths:

                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 P
                                 1, a path from vi
                                  to x that crosses vp
                                 ;


                                 P
                                 2, a path from vi
                                  to x that crosses vq
                                 .

In the following, we embed the edge e, including the endpoints, on a real line such that vp
                         < vq
                        . For convenience, we abuse the notation vi
                         to denote the coordinates of vertex vi
                         and abuse the notation x to denote the coordinates of point x. We designate the point x′ ∈ e as a sensitive point if at least one vertex vi
                         exists such that the evacuation path for vi
                         is different when x ∈ (vp, x′] and x ∈ (x′, vq
                        ). Let

                         and the corresponding time is T(xopt
                        (s), s). Since there are O(mn
                        2) scenarios, with additional O(m
                        2
                        n
                        3) time, we can obtain the values of xopt

In this subsection, based on the results in the previous subsection, we present an O(mn
                        4) time algorithm for determining the minimax regret sink x
                        * that minimizes Rmax
                        (x). We divide the points on G into two parts: points located on a vertex and points located on an edge. For the points located on an edge, we divide the edge into O(n) intervals such that R(x, s) is convex in each interval. First, we discuss the situation where the sink point is located on a vertex.

Note that we already obtained the values of T(x, s) for all x ∈ V and all 
                           
                              s
                              ∈
                              D
                           
                         when we computed the values xopt
                        (s) and T(xopt
                        (s), s) for all 
                           
                              s
                              ∈
                              D
                           
                        . Thus, with a given vertex vi
                        , we can obtain R(vi, s) for all 
                           
                              s
                              ∈
                              
                                 D

                         in O(n) time. Therefore,

                              R
                              
                                 (

                                    i
                                 
                                 ,
                                 s
                                 )
                              
                           
                         can be obtained in O(n) time. Then, we can obtain Rmax
                        (vi
                        ) in O(n
                        2) time for all vi
                        . If we let v* be a vertex such that Rmax
                        (v*) ≤ Rmax
                        (vi
                        ) for any vi
                         ∈ V, then we have the following lemma.

                           Lemma 13
                           
                              The values of v* and Rmax
                              (v*) can be computed in O(n
                              2) time.
                           

Next, we focus on the situation where the sink point is located on an edge 
                           
                              e

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this study, we considered the minimax regret 1-sink location problem with accessibility in a dynamic general network 
                        
                           G
                           =
                           
                              (
                              V
                              ,
                              E
                              )
                           
                        
                      with a uniform edge capacity. Each edge ej
                      ∈ E has a positive edge length l(ej
                     ) and a uniform edge capacity c. Each vertex vi
                      ∈ V has a positive weight that is unknown whereas the interval of the weight is known. This problem requires that a sink location be found such that the maximum regret of the evacuation time is minimized. We proposed an O(m
                     2
                     n
                     3) time algorithm where m is the number of edges on G and n is the number of vertices on G. In our algorithm, we divide the points on G into two parts: (1) points located on vertices and (2) points located on edges (except for the endpoints). For the points located on edges, it is possible that an infinite number of points need to be considered, but we only considered a finite set of points and proved some useful properties.
