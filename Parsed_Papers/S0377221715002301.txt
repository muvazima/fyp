                  Maintenance scheduling for high value assets has been studied for decades and is still a crucial area of research with new technological advancements. The main dilemma of maintenance scheduling is to avoid failures while preventing unnecessary maintenance. The technological advancements in real time monitoring and computational science make tracking asset health and forecasting asset failures possible. The usage and maintenance of assets can be planned more efficiently with the forecasted failure probability and remaining useful life (i.e., prognostic information). The prognostic information is time sensitive. Geographically distributed assets such as off-shore wind farms and railway switches add another complexity to the maintenance scheduling problem with the required time of travel to reach these assets. Thus, the travel time between geographically distributed assets should be incorporated in the maintenance scheduling when one technician (or team) is responsible for the maintenance of multiple assets. This paper presents a methodology to schedule the maintenance of geographically distributed assets using their prognostic information. Genetic Algorithm based solution incorporating the daily work duration of the maintenance team is also presented in the paper.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Today's highly competitive environment pressurizes industry for continuous cost reduction. Maintenance research has been attractive to researchers and industry in recent years because asset maintenance and repair significantly contribute to operation and support costs (Camci & Chinnam, 2010). In addition, maintenance is not a stand-alone operation, as it interacts with many other operations, such as production planning, inventory management, and personnel within the business, creating great complexity (Nourelfath & Châtelet, 2012).

Predictive maintenance proposes to maintain assets only when necessary in the right time, aiming to reduce unnecessary maintenance by monitoring and forecasting asset health. The term asset represents any system that is monitored for maintenance.

In predictive maintenance, the health of the asset is observed in operating time by analyzing signals that have been collected from sensors that are embedded in the assets. The process of detecting an existing incipient failure, called diagnostics, and the process of forecasting the time of the failure and identification of the remaining useful life (RUL) of the asset before failure occurs, called prognostics, are the two major steps in predictive maintenance (Camci & Chinnam, 2006; Eker et al., 2011; Jardine, Lin, & Banjevic, 2006). Maintenance may be scheduled immediately for an asset when an incipient failure is diagnosed. However, the asset with an incipient failure or some level of degradation can still be used until the complete failure. Identification of the time of the complete failure creates an opportunity for effective maintenance planning. The asset is expected to perform according to its typical functionality, but possibly less efficiently, within the identified RUL. Prognosis of a failure identifies the remaining useful life of the asset for effective maintenance planning and preparation.

In predictive maintenance research, the RUL may be time (e.g., 3 months to failure) or operational working period (e.g., 3000 miles of driving before failure) and is defined by setting a threshold value to a given parameter such as efficiency decrease or failure probability (Barbera, Schneider, & Kelle, 1996; Berenguer, Grall, Dieulle, & Roussignol, 2003; Marseguerra, Zio, & Podofillini, 2002; Sloan & Shanthikumar, 2002; Yam, Tse, Li, & Tu, 2001). In these cases, maintenance is performed when the parameter reaches the given threshold.

Even if the optimization of the threshold for prognostics information may be sufficient for some systems, it is not sufficient for maintenance scheduling of geographically distributed assets. Railway switches and wind turbines in wind farms are two examples of geographically distributed assets. The travelling cost for maintenance and the effects of travelling time on the probability of failure should be incorporated for effective maintenance scheduling of geographically distributed assets. For example, consider an off-shore wind farm with many wind turbines located in the middle of the sea. Assume that one of the wind turbines is scheduled for maintenance next week based on the threshold set for prognostics information. Should the wind turbines located close to the one scheduled for maintenance be maintained before coming back to the shore? If the maintenance operations for two wind turbines are scheduled consecutively, will it be possible for the technicians to be at the assets at their scheduled times considering the travel times?

This paper presents a formulation for the maintenance scheduling of geographically distributed assets to answer these types of questions by incorporating failure, maintenance, and travel costs in the same formula and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based solution. GA is a widely used approach to approximate the global optimum for non-linear problems and especially attractive in scheduling problems with binary representation power (Marseguerra et al., 2002). The contribution of the presented methodology is to increase the applicability of the presented problem to real systems with high numbers of assets and to incorporate work duration for maintenance operators in the formulation.


                     Section 2 gives the literature review, Section 3 presents the problem formulation, and Section 4 presents methodology to solve the problem. Section 5 demonstrates case studies, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Maintenance scheduling has been extensively studied in the past. The maintenance concept can be considered in three categories: corrective maintenance, periodic maintenance, and predictive maintenance (Camci & Chinnam, 2010). Corrective maintenance is a reactive action of repairing the assets after the failure. Periodic maintenance aims to avoid failure by periodic maintenance. Predictive maintenance focuses on early detection and forecasting of failures through condition monitoring techniques.

The majority of the early studies have focused on the optimization of the maintenance period. Because this paper is concerned with maintenance scheduling in predictive maintenance, studies about periodic maintenance scheduling will not be discussed. Reference Ben-Daya, Duffuaa, and Raouf (2000) reviews the early studies on maintenance scheduling.

Group maintenance aims to group the components based on their functionalities, spacial closeness in the system, expected life times, and other properties (Gertsbakh, 1984; Sheu & Jhang, 1997). When one of the components fails or needs maintenance, the whole group is replaced or maintained. This grouping is performed using the components of one system (Levrat, Iung, Macchi, Thomas, & Voisin, 2011; Thomas, Levrat, & Iung, 2008; Van, Florent, Keomany, Barros, & Berenguer, 2011; Van, Vu, Barros, & Berenguer, 2012). Opportunistic maintenance aims to identify possible preventive maintenance options when the system stops due to failure or the need for maintenance of one component (Dagpunar, 1996; Nakagawa & Murthy, 1993). The inter-relation between opportunistic maintenance and mission planning or the job shop schedule depending on the asset types have been studied for further cost reduction (Zhou, Lu, & Xi, 2012). These approaches are based on failures that have already occurred and on scheduled maintenance.

The usage of RUL information for maintenance scheduling and mission planning has been reported in Li, Ambani, and Ni (2009), Papakostas, Papachatzakis, Xanthakis, Mourtzis, and Chryssolouris (2010), Sandborn and Wilkinson (2007). The aforementioned threshold setting on the estimated RUL is the general approach in predictive maintenance. The optimization of the threshold value for the RUL is studied in reference Marseguerra et al. (2002). The problem of the static threshold is discussed and a dynamic threshold concept is presented in reference Li, You, and Ni (2009). However, it is clearly demonstrated in references Camci (2009a, 2009b) that the threshold setting for RUL will not always provide the best maintenance scheduling, especially for systems with multiple dependent components.

Several studies exist that aim to obtain an effective maintenance schedule without an RUL threshold setting. Zhang et al. has used semi-Markov models to represent the deterioration of roads for maintenance planning (Zhang & Gao, 2012). You et al. presents a maintenance management tool for a batch of single-unit systems by incorporating past statistical information and failure predictions of individual systems (You, Liu, Wang, & Meng, 2010). Multi-objective optimization has been used in Wang and Pham (2011) for the maintenance policy of a single-unit system. However, none of these studies aim to address geographically distributed assets. This paper aims to schedule the maintenance based on the analysis of RUL values of geographically distributed assets and the travel distances between them.

The Travelling Repairman Problem (TRP) discussed in the literature addresses repair scheduling of distributed assets (Fakcharoenphol, Harrelson, & Rao, 2003; Garcia, Jodra, & Tejel, 2002; Irani, Lu, & Regan, 2004; Jothi & Raghavachari, 2007). Although the name “repairman” evokes the problem presented, the nature of the problem is totally different. In TRP, it is assumed that the assets in various locations have already failed, and the best route for the repairman is sought to optimize the situation such that the minimum total asset down time is achieved. For example, consider four failed assets in different locations and the company loses money for each minute of down time of all assets. TRP aims to minimize the total loss of down time by identifying the best repair order of assets considering the travel times between assets. TRP is also known as the Delivery Man Problem (Fischetti, Laporte, & Martello, 1993) and the Minimum Latency Problem (Blum et al., 1994).

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which aims to minimize the total routing cost of K vehicles to n destinations, constrained by exactly one visit to each destination, has also been used for maintenance operations (Pillac, Gendreau, Guéret, & Medaglia, 2013). Maintenance scheduling is modelled through VRP in various situations, such as seasonal road maintenance (Ribeiro, Laporte, & Mauri, 2012) and incorporation of production loss due to maintenance travel time (Perrier, Langevin, & Campbell, 2007). VRP is a variant of TRP with multiple maintainers, and asset failure probabilities are not considered in the maintenance scheduling. The maintenance scheduling for geographically distributed equipment has been studied and modelled as a collection of maximum time-dependent reward problems in Tang, Miller-Hooks, and Tomastik (2007). Time-dependent rewards are assumed to be given in Tang et al. (2007), which may come from condition monitoring, customer satisfaction, availability or other factors. This paper models time-dependent rewards with prognostics information, which has been highlighted as an option in reference Tang et al. (2007).

The Travelling Maintainer Problem (TMP) aims to find the most cost-effective routing for the maintenance operator to visit assets that have not yet failed (Camci, 2014). The routing is affected by the RUL and the distance of each asset. The formulation of TMP in Camci (2014) has practicality issues due to the computational time for high number of assets and the realization of the maintenance plan as constrained by the work durations of the maintenance operators. The method presented in this paper offers practical solutions for real applications by handling high number of assets and realistic operator work durations (e.g., 8 hours work period per day).

The number of studies using Genetic Algorithm for maintenance optimization is huge. Availability is optimized with preventive maintenance scheduling using GA in a nuclear system in Aghaie, Norouzi, and Zolfaghari (2013). Maintenance scheduling of multi-unit system have been performed through GA in Camci (2009a, 2009b), Zhang, Cheng, and Liu (2012). Maintenance optimization of rocket engine (Chen, Li, & Jin, 2013), rural roads (Sara & Kuncheria, 2014), and power generation units (Andrija, Borut, & Tome, 2008) are achieved through GA. GA is also commonly used in Travelling Salesman (TSP) type problems that require incorporation of travelling time and cost within the problem (Arkabandhu, Arnab, & Subhajit, 2013; Hussain, 2013; 2014; Pei-Chann, Wei-Hsiu, & Zhen-Zhen, 2012; Yong, 2014; Yuichi & David, 2012; Yuichi & Shigenobu, 2013).

The presented solution with GA models the problem as two sub-problems: maintenance time identification of assets and ordering of assets assigned for maintenance in the same time unit (e.g., day, work duration). The solution of the former sub-problem identifies the time unit of the maintenance for the assets. Note that maintenance of multiple assets could be performed in a given time unit. The solution of the latter sub-problem orders the assets to be maintained in a time unit. The problem is formulated in such a way that both sub-problems are solved together at the same time. This model makes the problem computationally efficient and can handle large number of assets. This is a unique approach in maintenance scheduling of geographically distributed assets using prognostics information as well as maintainer work duration.

Consider multiple assets that are geographically distributed. A maintainer or maintenance team is responsible for the maintenance and repair of these assets. The health of each asset is observed using condition monitoring techniques and is forecasted by analyzing the signals obtained using prognostics as in Camci and Chinnam (2005), Camci, Medjaher, Zerhouni, and Nectoux (2013). Fig. 1
                      illustrates this problem with eight assets, in which failure probabilities are obtained from prognostics.

Failure probabilities obtained from prognostics are valid until scheduled maintenance has been performed. Assume that there is a developing failure in a part of the machine. Prognostic presents failure probability values indicating the degradation of the health state of the asset. After the part is replaced or maintained, the failure probability should be reset since there will not be a link between this failure probability and the part. Thus, failure probabilities obtained from prognostics will be useful until the maintenance. Since the health state after maintenance will be different from the health state before maintenance, the forecasted failure probabilities after maintenance should base on the reliability analysis of similar assets. Thus, the asset failure probability at time t is obtained from prognostic if no maintenance has been scheduled before t or from reliability analysis if any maintenance is scheduled before t. No assumption has been made about failure probabilities and any time series data obtained from prognostics or reliability analysis can be used. This problem aims to develop the optimal maintenance schedule that leads to minimum cost for these distributed assets.

The assumptions made for the presented method are as follows:

                        
                           •
                           The maintenance operator or team should start and end at the depot. In case of a maintenance team, the team cannot be split into groups. This assumption may be removed by setting the distance from depot to one asset or all assets to 0 (

The problem does not involve assignment of different operators to different assets; but determines a maintenance schedule that can be performed by a maintenance operator or team.

Assets degrade and the degradation is forecasted with prognostics. The forecasted degradation through time units is quantified as expected failure probability.

Degradation of an asset within a time unit (day) is ignored and scheduling within the time unit is performed based on travel convenience. In other words, maintenance of an asset in the morning is the same in terms of failure expectation as maintenance of the same asset in the afternoon of the same day.

The work duration has a normal and maximum working periods. If the actual working time is between normal and maximum working period, the maintenance is completed with some extra cost, which is considered as a penalty in the objective function. However, the actual working time should not exceed the maximum work duration in the planning phase. However, if the actual working time in a time unit exceeds the maximum work duration in practice, then the unfinished work should be left to the next time unit and maintenance scheduling should be re-calculated with the new status.

If any of the assets fails before the scheduled maintenance, then maintenance should be re-scheduled based on new parameters.

If the failure probability estimations change due to an incipient failure, then maintenance scheduling should be re-run. Scheduled maintenance will be valid until the forecasted failure probabilities change or the scheduled maintenance is completed.

The utilization percentage of the work period in a time unit is not directly considered. In other words, the unused portion of the work duration is not directly penalized. However, leaving maintenance to later times even if performing it earlier is possible will increase the failure cost. The effect of unused part of the work duration will be indirectly handled.

An asset can be maintained only once in a given planning horizon. Thus, the planning period should be short enough, in which none of the assets requires second maintenance within the planning period. The maintenance scheduling is run in regular planning periods. Since using a long planning period may not be practical due to the possible failure or unexpected events, this is a reasonable assumption.

Based on these assumptions, the problem involves two steps: assignment and ordering. In the assignment step, the assets are assigned to future days for maintenance. In the ordering step, the order of maintenance visits is performed. Both steps are performed in such a way that the total cost is minimized and the maintenance operator is able to finish the daily tasks. The term ‘time unit’ or ‘day’ refers to the continuous working period of the maintainer or maintenance team, in which multiple assets can be maintained. For example, a maintenance ship may leave for a week to maintain multiple wind turbines in the sea. The term ‘time unit’ refers to this week, which is the working period for the maintenance team. The cost of maintenance scheduling of geographically distributed assets includes expected failure cost (CF
                     ), maintenance cost (CM
                     ), and travel cost (CT
                     ). The objective function to be minimized is given in (1), and each type of cost is discussed in the following sections.

Direct and indirect costs occur due to a failure. The repair cost is the direct failure cost (Fi
                        ). The indirect failure cost is the cost of down-time or unavailability, such as the production loss or the inability to perform the mission. The expected failure cost is the sum of the expected direct and indirect failure costs. The expected direct failure cost is calculated as the product of the cumulative failure probability on day t (P
                        
                           i, t
                        ) and the direct failure cost (Fi
                        ). The expected indirect failure cost is calculated as the product of the expected duration of downtime at day t (DTi
                        ), cumulative failure probability (P
                        
                           i, t
                        ) and the cost of having downtime, per unit time (δi
                        ). DTi
                         represents the expected downtime when a failure occurs in asset i. Note that P
                        
                           i, t
                         is a variable related to the health of the system at day t, whereas Fi, DTi
                        , and δi
                         are predefined constants. The formulation of the expected failure calculation is given in Eq. (2). T should be long enough to extract real value of the maintenance planning and short enough to reduce the unexpected events during the planned maintenance. Too long planning period (large T) may lead to possible failures, failure detections, or degradation which has not been detected/considered in the planning phase. The consecutive planning using too short planning period (small T) may avoid some optimum solutions that could be obtained with longer planning period.

Although failure probability increase might be continuous, it is discretized for each day for the sake of problem formalization. Once the maintenance of assets is assigned to days, the degradation within the day is not considered, and scheduling within the day is performed based on travel convenience.

The cumulative failure probability (P
                        
                           i, t
                        ) is calculated based on either prognostic or reliability analysis. If no maintenance is scheduled from the current time until the time t, then the P
                        
                           i, t
                         is the forecasted failure probability obtained from the prognostic (PP
                        ). If any maintenance is scheduled from current time until the time t, P
                        
                           i, t
                         bases on the expected failure probability after the latest maintenance before time t, which is calculated based on the reliability analysis of the asset after maintenance (PR
                        ). PP
                         is the expected failure probability if the system is left as it is without maintenance as shown with solid curve in Fig. 2
                        . The x-axis in the figure represents time, and the y-axis represents the asset failure probability. PP
                         cannot be used for the time after a maintenance, since it bases on the analysis of the current and forecasted health of the system. In contrary, PR
                         bases on the analysis of similar assets and their failure probabilities after maintenance. P
                        
                           i, t
                        (V
                        1) at time t
                        1 is obtained from PP
                        , since no maintenance is scheduled before t
                        1, whereas P
                        
                           i, t
                        (V
                        2) at time t
                        2 is obtained from PR
                        , since a maintenance is scheduled before t
                        2 as seen in Fig. 2.

The calculation of the failure probability based on either PP
                         or PR
                         is given in Eq. (3). If maintenance is performed before time t, then the failure probability bases on the failure probability obtained from reliability analysis and the last maintenance time (LM). Otherwise, it is the value obtained from prognostic.

                        Fig. 2 illustrates the failure probability decrease when maintenance is performed. As seen from the figure, performing maintenance decreases the failure probability.

The maintenance cost (CM
                        ) is the sum of the scheduled maintenance costs for scheduled asset i in the given period. However, if the system fails before the scheduled maintenance, then the maintenance is not performed. Thus, the expected maintenance cost should be calculated as the product of fixed maintenance cost (γi
                        ), and the probability of performing the maintenance actions for an asset i as shown in (5). (1 − P
                        
                           i, t
                        ) is the probability of not having a failure (thus, the probability of performing the maintenance).

Failure and maintenance costs are calculated for each asset based on the failure probabilities and maintenance schedule of individual assets within the entire given period. On the other hand, the travel cost (CT
                        ) is based on the order of the assets to be visited during each time unit (t). The order of the cities is represented by

                        , which is the asset number visited in the ith order at time t. The travel cost is calculated by the sum of the product of travelled distance and the cost of travelling per unit distance, as shown in Eq. (6).

A penalty function is used to penalize the work duration that exceed the normal work duration for the maintenance operators. This can be thought as an extra payment to the operators when they work extra hours. Eq. (7) gives the formalization of the penalty function. The final term (Pen) is the cost of the excess working hours for the maintenance team, which increase the cost of maintenance by cγ
                         for the exceeded duration. However, note that extra working hours in a day is limited and an operator cannot exceed the maximum working hours in a time unit. Note also that the extra duration may be different every day and penalty is depended on the extra duration. This is formulated as a constraint in the objective function, whereas extra payment is added in the cost function to be minimized.

The representation of decision variable (x
                        
                           i, t
                        ) in the Genetic Algorithm and the formulation of the maintenance team routing in a day are discussed in the following section.

A Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based methodology is presented in this section. First, we provide general information about GA. Then, we present the GA parameter formatting.

GA is a mature method to approximate the global optimum for non-linear problems. A GA attempts to provide one of the best possible results but cannot guarantee a global optimal solution in a finite time. The solution is represented as a binary string. A number is assigned to each asset. Predefined number bits in the binary string are reserved for asset numbers. Table 1
                        
                         illustrates two permutations and their representations as binary strings. Three bits are enough to represent the asset numbers in this example.

This paper uses existing GA operators (i.e., scattered crossover and Gaussian mutation) and does not present new GA operators (i.e., crossover and mutation). In a scattered crossover, the chromosome of the child is copied from a randomly selected parent. In the Gaussian mutation, a random number generated with Gaussian distribution is added to the gene to generate the new individual. Readers are referred to Mitchell (1998) for more detailed information about GA.

GA is expected to achieve two tasks for the formulation presented in Eq. (8): the assignment of assets to time for maintenance (i.e., assignment task) and ordering the assets at a given time for the visit (i.e., ordering task). θi
                         is binary string decision variable in the size of log
                        2(T + 1) to perform assignment task. ɛ
                           i
                         is a continues number to perform the ordering task. The decision variable used in GA is the combination of [θ; ɛ] with the size of n × (1 + log
                        2(T + 1)) numbers.


                        θi
                         is a binary string and obtained by x
                        
                           i, t
                         in the formulations above. θi
                         indicates the time of maintenance of asset i; whereas x
                        
                           i, t
                         is a binary string representing maintenance time by 1 in the string. For example, if x
                        
                           i, 1: T
                         = 0001000 stating maintenance time as 4; this is represented by θi
                         as 100. There exist two major issues in using x
                        
                           i, 1: T
                         directly in GA: a high number of variables and the possibility of multiple visits to the same asset in a short time. n × T number of variables (bits) are needed if x
                        
                           i, t
                         is directly used in GA. In addition, GA operations may lead to consecutive maintenance of the same asset or multiple maintenance assignments within a short time period. Thus, θi
                         is used to represent x
                        
                           i, t
                         in a different format. θi
                         is a binary string that represents the time units in the given period (

                        ) and the time unit of the maintenance for asset i. In other words, x
                        
                           i, t
                         = δ(t − decimal(θi
                        )), where δ is the Dirac function. For example, if asset i is scheduled for maintenance at time unit 6, then θi
                         = 0110, given that T = 15. This representation resolves both of the issues mentioned above. The number of bits is n × log
                        2(T + 1), and each asset can be maintained only once or not maintained at all (i.e., θi
                         = 0000). x
                        
                           i, t
                         is obtained using θi
                         during the calculation of objective function in Eq. (9) when GA is running.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

This section presents a case study about the considered problem. The formulation and methodology presented are applied to the case study under four scenarios. The first one is the base scenario with various n and T values. Each of the other three scenarios demonstrates the effects of costs due to failure, maintenance, and travel. The following section discusses these scenarios.

This scenario involves a maintenance team working 7 days a week with 8 working hours in each day. The consideration of the number of maintainers on the team and their rotations is out of the scope of this paper. This team is responsible for the maintenance of n distributed assets. Maintenance scheduling is performed every T days to create the team's work plan. After planning, the maintenance schedule does not change unless an unexpected failure or emergency is reported. At the end of the planning period, or if a plan is changed due to an unexpected event, a new schedule is created to integrate the new information.

The travel distances between the assets are designed in such a way that the average travel time between assets is approximately 60 minutes (one unit distance is assumed to be travelled in 1 minute). The maintenance time for any asset is assumed to be 60 minutes. The scheduling may allow overtime up to 10 hours (cγ
                         = 0.25), with an extra-cost of five times the fixed maintenance cost per overtime unit. The working time per day cannot exceed 10 hours.

Fixed failure, fixed maintenance, and unit downtime costs are assumed to be constant for all assets. It is possible to assign a different value to each asset. The values used for these parameters, including unit distance travel cost, are given in Table 2.

The scheduling has been performed for various number assets (n = 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64) and time periods (T = 3, 7, 15, 31, and 63). The time period is calculated based on the formula 2
                           i
                          1, where i is an integer. The power of two is needed to fully represent the time period in the log2 form, as discussed previously. If the time period is selected arbitrarily, the GA operations (mutation and crossover) may lead to an asset maintenance time that is greater than the given period. The all zero binary string is reserved for the option of not maintaining an asset in the given time period. Thus, the number of time units that can be represented with the length of the binary string is one less than the power of two. There is no requirement or limitation for the number of assets. However, the numbers are selected in such a way as to represent the exponential increase in considered assets. This method does not use short time periods for a high number of assets nor long time periods for a small number of assets. The configuration of the n and T values used for scheduling runs is given in Table 3
                        .

We have considered three different values for population size (i.e., population) and the maximum number of iterations (i.e., generations) (50, 500, and 5000) for a given T and n. Each parameter combination has been run 10 times using GA, and the statistics (min, mean, max, and standard deviations) of the total costs are displayed in Table 4
                        . As observed from the table, when n = 4, we obtained the same results for all values of T except for two cases (i.e., T = 15, T = 31, generation = 50, population = 50). It is very difficult, if not impossible, to identify the global optimum points. However, obtaining the same answer for all 10 runs (when standard deviation is 0) may be an indication of finding the global optimum. When the complexity increases with the increase of T (T = 15, T = 31; n = 4), the same answer could not be obtained with small population (population = 50). When n = 8, the increasing generation and population parameters reduce the variance of the results found and the same minimum value is obtained when population and generation are 500 and 5000. Also note that the mean value is closer to the minimum when the population is 5000 compared to the case where population is 500. When n > 8, increasing number of generations and population from 50 to 500 leads to better minimum value. However, increasing them further (from 500 to 5000) does not always lead to better minimum value. This shows the limit of performance increase with the increase of population and number of generations for the given complex problem. The variance of the result reduces when the generation and population parameters increase. The number of possible solutions for n = 64 and T = 63 is more than (

                        ). This includes only the assignment of assets by time unit, and does not include the ordering of the assets assigned within the same time unit. Table 5
                         displays the computational time statistics for the runs of all parameter combinations. Increasing the number of generations and the population by 10 times increases the computational time approximately by a factor of 10. It is interesting to note that the minimum of optimum results for the case of n = 64, T = 15, and population = 500 is very low compared to population of 50 and 5000. Very high standard deviation in this case (around 10 times more than the case with population size is 5000) compared to the others indicates the effect of randomness in the initialization.

The number of non-maintained assets is related to the intensity of the maintenance schedule. If T is selected large enough to handle all the assets, number of non-maintained assets are generally zero. If the work duration in all time units is fully booked, then some of the assets are left without maintenance. For example, average of number of non-maintained assets is 3.8 in the runs when n = 32 and T = 7. Similarly, average of number of non-maintained assets is 10.2 for n = 64 and T = 15. It reduces to 0, when the T is increased to 15 and 31, respectively.

To create different scenarios, we considered the case where n = 32 and T = 7. Fig. 3
                         displays the failure probabilities of the assets for the minimum cost found when n = 32 and T = 7 (TotalCost = 5505.4 ComputationalTime = 2606.7). The failure probabilities of non-maintained assets have been displayed with dotted line. The maintenance assignments with regard to time units and order of visits are displayed in Table 6
                        .

This scenario demonstrates the effect of the travel cost to the maintenance scheduling. The distances between the assets are modified to create three clusters: assets 1–10 in cluster 1, assets 11–20 in cluster 2, and assets 21–32 in cluster 3. Assets in a cluster are close to each other and far from the assets in other clusters. Table 7
                         displays the statistics of the result of 10 runs with this scenario. Table 8
                         displays the best schedule found. As observed from Table 8, assignment of assets to time units is affected by this clustering. Tendency to assign assets in the same cluster into the same time unit is clearly seen when compared with the result in the base scenario in Table 6. No maintenance has been assigned in time unit 4 and only one maintenance appointment has been assigned in time unit 5. This may induce some operational and management issues. However, this potential situation is outside of the scope of this paper, and similar practical concerns could be applied with penalization within the objective function. Fig. 4
                         displays the failure probabilities with the maintenance schedule in the given scenario.

The aim of this scenario is to demonstrate the effect of prognostics on the presented problem. As mentioned before, prognostics forecasts the failure progression real time. When a failure is detected, prognostics method updates the failure probability values for an asset. Increased failure probability increases the expected failure cost as shown in Eq. (2). The maintenance of the first asset has been scheduled in the second half of the time period in scenario 1, as shown in the first row of Table 9
                        
                        . The failure probability of the asset has been increased by a constant value of 0.3 for all time units as an indication of step-wise degradation which is captured through prognostics. Even though a constant stepwise increase is used in this example, the probability increase might be a new time series data for failure probabilities representing the new degradation forecast. Maintenance time of first asset is given in Table 9 as Scenario 2_a. In some of the runs, the maintenance of asset 1 has been moved to earlier times. In 7 out of 10 cases, the maintenance has been performed in the later part of the time period (days 5, 6, 7) in scenario 1; whereas this is reduced to 4 in this scenario, which shows the effect of increased failure probability on the maintenance schedule. To show the effect of increased failure cost more clearly, the direct failure cost of the first asset has been multiplied by 10 in this scenario instead of increasing the failure probability. As shown in the third row of Table 9 (Scenario 2_b), the maintenance of the first asset has been moved to the first time unit in all runs. Fig. 5
                         illustrates the failure probabilities for both scenarios. The thicker dashed line is the failure probability of asset 1. Note that the maintenance schedule of other assets may also be different because these are obtained through different runs.

In this scenario, the fixed maintenance cost has been changed to 100, which is 10 times more than in other scenarios. The total number of maintenance actions for all of the assets in different scenarios is displayed in Table 10. As observed from the table, the number of maintenance actions scheduled is less in scenario 3 than it is in the other scenarios. A t-test shows that the distribution of the total number of maintenance events obtained in the runs for scenario 3 is significantly different than it is for scenarios 1 and 2. The increase in the cost of maintenance decreases the number of maintenance events that are scheduled.

It would be valuable to compare these results with a different approach for the same problem. It is not possible to make an exact comparison, since the solution presented in this paper modifies the problem to improve its practicality. The approach presented in Camci (2014) orders the assets without considering the work duration and number of possible visits per day. The number of variables in Camci (2014) is defined as n × log
                        2(n), if total of n visit is planned. On the other hand, the number of variables is n × (1 + log
                        2(T)) in the presented approach. The computational time of these approaches are in the order of n × log(n) and n × log(T), respectively. If it is assumed that each day only one asset can be maintained, which could be the worst case of the presented approach; then T becomes equal to n(T = n) leading to n × log(n) number of variables for the presented approach. In other words, the worst case of the presented approach is in the level of the previous approach. When multiple assets have been maintained per day, the number of assets that can be modeled in the problem increases. The practicality of the presented approach is beyond its computational advantage.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The pressure for cost reduction for maintenance and repair has increased the research on predictive maintenance. The vision of researchers and industry for maintenance scheduling is to base the decision on failures and degradation. This paper presents a method that schedules the maintenance of geographically distributed assets based on an analysis of forecasted failure risks, maintenance and travel costs. The failure risk is calculated using the prognostics information in the form of forecasted asset failure probabilities. Failure risk incorporates direct failure costs, such as repair costs, and indirect failure costs, such as the cost of downtime. Maintenance cost is the cost of performing the maintenance action. This paper presents a GA-based solution for maintenance scheduling of geographically distributed assets. A case study has been discussed, considering different scenarios using various parameters. Further work is encouraged to address some of the operational and practical issues related to maintenance task assignment.
