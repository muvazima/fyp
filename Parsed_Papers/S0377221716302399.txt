                  This paper considers periodic preventive maintenance policies for a deteriorating repairable system. On each failure the system is repaired and, at the planned times, it is periodically maintained to improve its reliability performance. Most of periodic preventive maintenance (PM) models for repairable systems have been studied assuming that the failure process between two PMs follows the nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), implying the minimal repair on each failure. However, in this paper, we assume that the failure process between two PMs follows a new counting process which is a generalized version of the NHPP. We develop two types of PM models and study detailed properties of the optimal policies which minimize the long-run expected cost rates. Numerical examples are also provided.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the reliability area, various types of repairs have been developed based on different point processes and they have been applied for modeling the corresponding maintenance effects. After the classical maintenance model proposed by Barlow and Hunter (1960), mathematical sophistication of preventive maintenance models has increased. Comprehensive discussions on different maintenance models can be found in Canfield (1986), Nakagawa (1986), Nguyen and Murthy (1981) and Liu et al. (1995). More theoretical and sophisticated models have also been developed; see Aven and Jensen (2000), Cheng and Chen (2003), Marais and Saleh (2009), Mercier (2002), Mercier and Pham (2012), Vaughan (2005), Wang and Zhang (2013) and Chenetal (2015). See also Valdez-Flores and Feldman (1989), Wang (2002) and Tadj, Ouali, Yacout, and Ait-Kadi (2011) for surveys on various practical maintenance models. Nakagawa (2005) provides an overview on more theoretical maintenance models.

Maintenance actions can generally be divided into two types: corrective maintenance (CM) and preventive maintenance (PM). For a deteriorating repairable system, the CM action is conducted upon failure to recover the system from a failure, whereas the PM action is performed at the planned time to improve the system reliability performance. Most of the periodic PM models for repairable systems have been studied assuming that the failure process between two PMs follows the nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), which implies that the repair type of the CM performed on each failure is the minimal repair (see, e.g., Cheng & Chen, 2003; Cheng, Zhao, Chen, & Sun, 2014; Nakagawa, 1986; Nguyen & Murthy, 1981; Park, Jung, & Yum, 2000). By the ‘minimal repair’, we mean that the state of the system after the repair is restored to the as-bad-as-old condition, i.e., to the state it had prior to the failure. As the failure process in this case follows the NHPP, the assumption of minimal repair generally allows a closed-form of results (e.g. the long-run expected cost rates) and nice mathematical properties for the optimal solutions in maintenance optimization.

However, practically, when a component in a system fails, this may lead to a more hostile working environment through increased pressure, temperature, humidity, and so on, causing instantaneous stress or damage to the adjacent non-failed components. It eventually results in the system degradation and, hence, an increase in the level of the system failure rate function (see El-Damcese, 1997; Hoyland & Rausand, 1994; and Jeong, 2012). For example, (a) the failure of a still wire cable in a bridge or in an elevator instantaneously increases the stress on the remaining cables and leads to some damages before repairing the failed one; (b) for a multi-engine airplane, the failure of an engine during flight instantaneously causes increased stress on the non-failed engines until landing for the repair of the failed engine; (c) a failure of a pump in a multi pump hydraulic control system instantly increases the pressure for each non-failed pump until the repair of the failed one; (d) when an electric device fails by an external shock (electric or mechanical shock), the non-failed components also experience this external shock and their reliability performances can be worse than before.

Under the situations illustrated above, after the repair of the failed component, the reliability performances of the non-failed components are worse than before the failure. Accordingly, the overall state of the system after the repair of the failed component is worse than the state it had just prior to the failure. As illustrated above, in practice, this type of ‘worse-than-minimal repair’ happens not because of a repair action (e.g., a faulty repair), but because of the negative effect caused by a failure in the system.

Motivated by the above consideration, in this paper, we introduce a new repair type which is ‘worse-than-minimal repair’, based on the Generalized Polya Process (GPP). The GPP has been recently described based on the notion of stochastic intensity and its probabilistic properties have been studied in detail (Cha, 2014). It will be seen that this new repair process includes the minimal repair process as a special case and, accordingly, it is a generalized version of the minimal repair process. It will also be seen that the GPP relaxes the restrictive ‘independent increments property’ of the NHPP, which has an important practical meaning from maintenance modeling point of view (see Section 2). Then, assuming that the failure process between two PMs follows the GPP, we study and discuss a relevant maintenance optimization problem.

The main objective of Cha (2014) was to study the probabilistic properties of the GPP. Then, it suggested a possible application of the GPP to a reliability problem by providing an example which applies the GPP to the simplest ‘replacement’ policy. On the other hand, in this current paper, we develop two types of PM models based on the new repair process, which combine CM, PM and replacement. In the two PM models, the system is preventively maintained (PM) at periodic times iT, 
                        
                           i
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           N
                           −

                     , and is replaced at NT (Replacement). The reliability improvement made by a PM is stochastically modeled based on the properties of the GPP. The failures of the system which occur between PMs are repaired by the new type of repair (CM). Thus, the corresponding PM policies are characterized by two PM parameters (N, T). For each model, we study detailed properties of the optimal PM policies (N*, T*) which minimize the long-run expected cost rates. Because the PM models in this paper are developed based on a new type of repair process instead of the conventional minimal repair process, the current work would suggest a new research direction in the study of PM.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce a new type of generalized repair which is worse-than-minimal-repair based on the GPP. We also interpret the involved parameter in the new repair process from the PM modeling point of view. In Section 3, we develop the two types of PM models. For each model, we derive the properties of the optimal policy and, based on them, we provide two-stage optimization procedure. In Section 4, numerical examples are provided for illustrations. Finally in Section 5, concluding remarks are given and further topics to be developed are suggested.

Although the minimal repair process based on the NHPP has been a very useful tool for modeling the failure process of a repairable system, its practical limitation also exists. For instance, the NHPP possesses the independent increment property. This implies that the future failure process in this case does not depend on the failure history of the system. For instance, suppose that we have two systems at time t: one has experienced no failure until time t, whereas the other one has experienced frequent failures and has been minimally repaired until time t. Under the minimal repair assumption, these two systems have no statistical difference at all, e.g., their future failure rates are the same. On the other hand, as will be seen in this section, the GPP does not possess the independent increment property and, under the GPP repair assumption, the future reliability performance of a system becomes worse and worse as the number of system failures occurred in the past increases. Thus, from this practical point of view, the GPP repair can be understood as a practically more plausible assumption in maintenance modeling. Some recent works such as Babykina and Couallier (2014) and Le Gat (2014) have shown that the GPP is better fitted to some real field failure data sets than the traditional NHPP model.

Note that one counting process corresponds to one repair type and vice versa. For instance, the ‘perfect repair’ corresponds to the renewal process and the ‘minimal repair’ corresponds to the NHPP. Thus, to define a new type of repair, we need a new counting process. We will now introduce the concept of stochastic intensity and, based on it, we provide the definition of the GPP.

                         is the time from 0 until the arrival of the ith event in [0, t). The point processes can be mathematically described by using the concept of the stochastic intensity (the intensity process) λt, t ≥ 0 (Aven & Jensen, 1999, 2000). As discussed in Cha and Finkelstein (2011), Finkelstein and Cha (2013) and Cha (2014), the stochastic intensity λt
                         of an orderly point process {N(t),  t ≥ 0} is defined as the following limit:

Based on the GPP, we will now define a new type of repair, which is called the ‘GPP repair’. In the following discussions, we assume that the duration of a repair is negligible. Define {N(t),  t ≥ 0} as the failure process of the system with its failure rate λ(t) which undergoes a type of repair on each failure, where N(t) is the total number of failures in (0, t].


                        
                           Definition 2
                           GPP repair

For a system with its failure rate λ(t), a repair type is called the ‘GPP repair’ with the parameter α if {N(t),  t ≥ 0} is the GPP with the parameter set (λ(t), α, 1).

Thus, under the GPP repair process, the corresponding stochastic intensity is specified as

In Cha (2014), the GPP repair was defined via three parameters (λ(t), α, β). However, by suitable re-parametrization, we can have the same stochastic intensity with (2) and thus the same failure process. Throughout this paper, we will follow Definition 2 rather than relying on that given in Cha (2014) due to its simplicity.

The parameter α determines the ‘degree of repair’. Obviously, 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0
                           
                        corresponds to the minimal repair and α > 0 implies that the repair is worse-than-minimal-repair. Furthermore, as α increases, the corresponding repair becomes worse and worse. For convenience, we will call λ(t) the baseline failure rate function and call the age which is defined based on the baseline failure rate function the intrinsic age.
                     

Now we will see how λt
                         in (2) evolves in time depending on the system's failure history. Denote by 0 ≤ s
                        1 ≤ s
                        2 ≤ ... the realization of sequential failure times. Based on (2), before the first failure time s

                         and, the stochastic intensity for 0 < t ≤ s
                        1 is given by λ(t). Thus, before the first failure, the stochastic intensity is the original failure rate of the system. Suppose now that the first failure has occurred at s
                        1. Then, after this failure and before the second failure time s

                         (minimal repair process) the stochastic intensity is just given by the fixed baseline failure rate λ(t), which does not depend on the failure history. On the other hand, when α > 0, the stochastic intensity jumps at each failure point and thus, under the GPP repair process, after each failure, the state of the system becomes worse than before the failure.

As mentioned before, the parameter α in Definition 2 can be understood as the ‘degree of repair’. Now we interpret the effect of the parameter α from the PM modeling point of view. For this, define the failure intensity function ϕ(t) as follows:

                        . As illustrated in Fig. 2, the larger alpha accelerates the deterioration, whereas smaller alpha decelerates it. Thus, under the GPP repair process, the parameter α determines the ‘deterioration rate’ of the system.

In this section, we develop two periodic PM models (Models 1 and 2) for a repairable deteriorating system and discuss the properties of the optimal policies. In both of the two periodic PM models, the PMs and CMs, and Replacements are performed according to the following general periodic PM policy.

                     , and is replaced at NT(replacement). The failures of the system which occur between PMs are repaired by the GPP repair (CM). The durations of the repair and replacements are negligible.
                  

The CM action is performed upon failure to recover the system from its failure. We assume that the type of repair on each failure is the GPP repair. The actions for PM are performed periodically at planned periodic times to improve the system reliability performance. Typical examples of PM action include oil changes or lubrication (for mechanical systems), inspection and adjustment, cleaning, reduction of the increased stress or damage, replacement or repair of some components, and so on. Generally, the effect of a PM action can be modeled via the failure intensity function (or failure rate function) and it can be classified into the following three categories:

                        
                           (i)
                           Failure intensity (or failure rate) reduction (e.g., Cheng et al., 2014; Lie & Chun, 1986; Pongpech & Murthy, 2006).

Deceleration of the deteriorating process, that is, the decrease of the deterioration speed (e.g., Canfield, 1986; Cheng, Chen, & Guo, 2007; Park et al., 2000).

Age reduction (e.g., Kijima, 1989; Levitin & Lisnianski, 2000).

Frequently, a PM model belongs to more than one category (hybrid PM models). See, e.g., El-Ferik and Ben-Daya (2006), Lin, Zuo, and Yam (2000), Sheu and Chang (2009).

In PM Model 1, the effect of a PM action is modeled by categories (i) and (ii), whereas, in PM Model 2, categories (i) and (iii) are captured. By a replacement, the system is returned to as-good-as-new state.

Under the two specific PM models to be defined in the following subsections, the aim of this paper is to find the optimal maintenance policy parameters (N*, T*) which minimize the long-run average cost rate. In these PM models, we assume that the initial failure process of the system without such periodic PM follows the GPP with the set of parameters (λ(t), α
                     0, 1).

Generally, PM reduces the failure intensity and numerous PM models include the failure intensity reduction. On the other hand, the “Operation of systems causes stress which results in system degradation and, hence, an increase in the level of the hazard function with time. PM is assumed to relieve stress and, hence, slow the rate of system degradation” (see El-Damcese, 1997
). Thus, in Model 1, the effect of a PM action will be modeled by (1) Failure intensity reduction and (2) Deceleration of the deteriorating process. As mentioned before, the initial failure process during (0, T] follows the GPP with the set of parameters (λ(t), α
                        0, 1). The assumptions of Model 1 for modeling the above PM effects are stated as follows.

                         (with respect to all possible realizations of the history) and also represents the mean number of failures per unit time at time t. In Fig. 4
                        , ϕPM
                        (t) is provided along with the failure intensity functions for the cases when there is no PM and when the minimal repair process is applied.

As can be seen from Fig. 4, ϕPM
                        (t) is between the intensity function of the minimal repair process and that for the case when there is no PM. Fig. 5
                         shows more detailed failure intensity change due to the PM and the effect of PM can be interpreted step by step based on it. In Fig. 5, the function ϕPM
                        (t) is depicted for the interval (0, 3.5].

Thus, just after the first PM at T, (Step 1) the failure intensity value is reduced to that of minimal repair process λ(T) (failure intensity reduction), and then (Step 2) the deterioration parameter is reduced to αPM
                        (deceleration of the deteriorating process).


                        
                           Remark 1
                           (i) In PM Model 1, we assume that a PM always involves the same set of actions and thus it takes the same cost. However, the PM action can reduce the failure intensity larger as the system ages because such PM action is generally more effective when the system is more deteriorated (or more aged).

(ii) Furthermore, we assume that, after a PM, the failure rate is reduced to the level equivalent to that of the minimal repair process. However, our PM Model 1 can have more flexibility by incorporating another parameter 0 < κ < 1 and by assuming that:

In this case, after a PM, the failure rate is reduced to a level which is less than that of the minimal repair process as in Model 2.

We will now obtain the expected cost rate of Model 1 as the function of (N, T), which is denoted by C
                           1(N, T). Let cGPP
                            be the cost of a GPP repair, cpm
                            be the cost of a PM, and cr
                            be the cost of a replacement. Let NGP
                            be the total number of GPP repairs performed in the renewal cycle. Note that the length of one renewal cycle is NT. Then, obviously, the long-run average cost rate function C

Replacement of a number of components in the system not only reduces the failure intensity, but also can make the system younger. Thus, in Model 2, the effect of a PM action will be modeled by (1) Failure intensity reduction and (2) Age reduction and the deterioration parameter α
                        0 will not be changed. As before, the failure processes in the PM intervals

                        0(T) ≡ 0, where the factor θ, 0 < θ ≤ 1, represents the degree of the PM efficiency (see also Section 4 for more detailed examples). Generally, Kijima's Model 1 is practically more appropriate because the virtual age in this case is not bounded and, in our further consideration and examples, we will consider this type of virtual age model. The stochastic intensity 
                           
                              λ

                                 P
                                 M
                              
                           
                         of PM Model 2 is depicted in Fig. 6
                        . Fig. 6 is an example obtained by assuming that the failures occurred at the points where “x” is marked.


                        Fig. 7
                         depicts the corresponding failure intensity function ϕPM
                        (t) for PM Model 2 along with those for the cases when there is no PM and when the minimal repair process is applied.


                        Fig. 8
                         shows the failure intensity change due to the PM in a more detail and the effect of PM can be interpreted step by step. In Fig. 8, the function ϕPM
                        (t) is depicted for the interval (0, 3.5].

Thus, just after PM at T, (Step 1) the failure intensity value is reduced to that of the minimal repair process λ(T) (failure intensity reduction), and then (Step 2) the age is reduced to

                         (age reduction).

                         can be limited only to the set [0, TU

                              for any T ≥ 0, which imply that, for any PM policy, the mean number of the system failures in a PM cycle strictly increases as the cycle increases. The condition in (8) obviously holds when λ(t) is strictly increasing, whereas it can be easily shown that the condition (6) is a sufficient condition for (7). Thus, it would be practically reasonable to apply Model 1 when the weak condition (6) is fulfilled (see also the corresponding examples in Section 4).

In this section, we will provide numerical examples for illustrations. In all the examples, it is assumed that the baseline failure rate function is given by

                      and the corresponding minimum cost rate are obtained following the similar two stage optimization procedure, for different values of θ, cpm

                     . The results are given in Table 2.

If we fix cpm
                      and αPM
                      (in Model 1) or fix cpm
                      and θ (in Model 2), and increase cr
                     , then, one could expect that the replacement time should become larger because a replacement becomes more expensive. As can be seen from the tables, 
                        
                           
                              N
                              k
                              *
                           
                           
                              T
                              k
                              *
                           
                        
                      is monotonically increasing as cr
                      increases. Furthermore, in this case, the relative PM cost becomes less expensive and there should be more frequent PM's. Thus, 
                        
                           T
                           k
                           *
                        
                      is monotonically decreasing. If we fix cr
                      and αPM
                      (or cr
                      and θ), and decrease cpm
                     , we can interpret the results in a similar way because the relative PM cost becomes less expensive in this case compared with the cost for a GPP repair and that for a replacement.

Now, we fix cr
                      and cpm
                     , and increase αPM
                      or θ. In this case, the PM becomes less efficient and the replacement should be performed earlier. Thus the replacement time 
                        
                           
                              N
                              k
                              *
                           
                           
                              T
                              k

                      is decreasing. Also, even when the PM is less efficient, there is still the effect of failure intensity reduction on each PM and PMs should be performed more frequently to compensate for the decreased PM effect. This results in the decrease in

In this paper, we defined a new repair process based on the GPP and discussed the relevant maintenance optimization. Two periodic PM models were considered and the optimal PM policy was discussed for each model. In the first model, the effect of a PM action was modeled by (1) Failure intensity reduction and (2) Deceleration of the deteriorating process. On the other hand, in the second PM model, it was modeled by (1) Failure intensity reduction and (2) Age reduction. For each model, we studied detailed properties of the optimal PM policies which minimize the long-run expected cost rates. In searching for the optimal PM policy, we developed a two-stage optimization procedure. At the first stage, we provided the explicit method for finding the optimal number of PM intervals for a given length of an interval, and, at the second stage, we suggested an upper bound for the optimal length of a PM interval. Combining these results, the optimal PM policy could be obtained efficiently. The obtained results were applied to several numerical examples. We interpreted the effect of relative change of the involved cost parameters and that of change of the PM efficiency parameters.

In the literature, numerous studies of preventive maintenance optimization have been performed assuming minimal repairs between PMs. However, from a practical point of view, the assumption of a minimal repair has a drawback. For instance, due to the independent increments property of the NHPP, the future reliability performance of the repaired system does not depend on the failure and repair history at all. On the other hand, under the GPP repair assumption, the future reliability performance of a system becomes worse and worse as the number of system failures in the past increases. Therefore, the assumption of the GPP repair could be regarded as a practically plausible one.

Furthermore, in the reliability area, numerous new repair types have been developed and suggested, generalizing the minimal repair. However, in most of those studies, mathematical calculations are not tractable and, generally, it is very difficult to study the properties of the optimal maintenance policy. The repair type defined based on the GPP can also be understood as a generalized version of the minimal repair and it allows a clear interpretation of the modeling parameter on the effect of the repair. Under the GPP repair assumption, the results in this paper were mostly obtained in closed forms. In future studies, the assumption of the GPP repair could also be applied to other topics in the reliability area as an alternative to the minimal repair when it is appropriate.

The logic of the proof for Model 2 is similar to that of Model 1 and we will follow the same procedure. By similar arguments as before, it can be shown that
