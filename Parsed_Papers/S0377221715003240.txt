                  In this paper, we develop an optimal shelf-space stocking policy when demand, in addition to the exogenous uncertainty, is influenced by the amount of inventory displayed (supply) on the shelves. Our model exploits stochastic dominance condition; and, we assume that the distribution of realized demand with higher stocking level stochastically dominates the distribution of realized demand with lower stocking level. We show that the critical fractile with endogenous demand may not exceed the critical fractile of the classical newsvendor model. Our computational results validate the optimality of amount of units stocked on the retail shelves.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In retail contexts such as groceries, apparel, and bookstores; shelf-space inventory is used as one of the levers to stimulate demand. Retailers can attract more sales volume of a product by increasing the shelf-space allocation. This phenomenon is evident even in online retailing portals. For example, for each book, Amazon.com displays the related titles to stimulate their demand. Marketing literature has recognized this motivational effect of displayed inventory level on the demand (Corstjens & Doyle, 1981; Dréze, Hoch, & Purk, 1994; Urban, 2005). From an operation’s perspective, traditionally, shelf-stocking policies are driven by the service level requirements. The fact that the displayed inventory on the retail shelves can play a role in stimulating customer demand is relatively a new attraction for operations and supply chain coordination (Balakrishnan, Pangburn, & Stavrulaki, 2004; Devangan, Amit, Mehta, Swami, & Shanker, 2013; Gerchak & Wang, 1994; Hariga, Al-Ahmari, & Mohamed, 2007; Irion, Lu, Al-Khayyal, & Tsao, 2012; Wang & Gerchak, 2001).

The shelf-stocking policies for inventory-level-dependent-demand (ILDD) should consider the latent demand that can be captured by higher level of display. Balakrishnan et al. (2004) differentiate the conventional, cost driven EOQ inventory policy by developing profit maximizing policy for demand stimulating products. However, they do not account for any form of demand uncertainty. Gerchak and Wang (1994) address ILDD issues with stochastic demand and determine periodic review inventory policy. The major limitation of their work is that they consider the functional form of ILDD to be deterministic, and assume the exogenous demand component to be stochastic.

In this paper, we develop an optimal shelf-stocking policy for a retailer when demand is influenced by the quantity of supply on the retail shelf. For products with demand stimulation effects, high stocking level results in high demand. This may lead to shortages. Moreover, due to exogenous uncertainty, the realized demand may be low resulting in excess inventories. Similarly, due to exogenous uncertainty, low stocking level may have high realized demand leading again to shortages. But, with low stocking levels, there also can an opportunity loss due to low demand stimulation.

Applying the stochastic dominance concept, we assume that the probability of higher realized demand is more with higher stocking level. The distribution of realized demand with higher stocking level stochastically dominates the distribution of realized demand with lower stocking level. This assumption of stochastic dominance permits us to model the endogenous impact of stocking level on the realized demand. Koschat (2008) empirically studies the impact of inventory on probability distributions of demand and sales in magazine retailing; and, observes first order stochastic ordering of demand distributions based on the inventory on the shelf.


                     Balakrishnan, Pangburn, and Stavrulaki (2008) propose a general demand-modeling framework to capture the demand stimulation effect; however, they ignore the shortage costs and use the saturation condition to ensure the concavity of the profit function. They show that the service level always exceeds the classical newsvendor critical fractile. Unlike Balakrishnan et al. (2008), our modeling of demand stimulation effect is motivated by the concept of stochastic dominance. We also incorporate the shortage costs; and, prove that, with shortage costs, the saturation condition is not needed for concavity. Furthermore, we argue analytically that with shortage costs, the critical fractile with endogenous demand may not always exceed the critical fractile of the classical newsvendor model.

The contributions of our research are as follows:

                        
                           1.
                           We develop an optimal shelf-stocking policy that comprehensively captures endogenous, supply driven demand uncertainty.

We differentiate the proposed shelf-stocking policy with the classical newsvendor critical fractile used for stochastic inventory models under exogenous demand uncertainty.

Our computational results validate the optimality of amount of units stocked on the retail shelves. Our results also quantify the contribution of demand stimulation and exogenous demand uncertainty in the service level. These insights serve the retail managers with shelf space allocation decisions.

We provide insights into the structure of the proposed shelf-stocking policy from firms’ risk perspective.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we outline the basic model and characterize its solution. Section 2.1 provides the critical fractile policy under supply driven demand uncertainty. Section 2.2 proves the optimality of the critical fractile policy. Section 3 validates the model with the computational results and provides sensitivity analysis of the key modeling parameters. Section 4 concludes the paper with discussion on the model and recommends future directions.

We consider a single-period problem with characteristics of a newsvendor retailer. The retail price of an item is fixed at p per unit. The retailer allocates s units of shelf space to an item. The item is procured by the retailer at marginal cost c. Any unsold inventory is penalized at h per unit. The shortages incur a cost of b per unit. To capture the impact of displayed inventory level, we assume that demand θ has a probability density function ϕ( ·, s) conditional on s. Given the stock level s, the cumulative density function of the demand is Φ( ·, s).

The relevant costs, marginal selling price, and the demand distribution are common knowledge. For a period, the expected profit as a function of the stocking quantity s is given by

The first term in Eq. (1) is the expected revenue when demand realize could be below s or exceed s. The second term is the expected cost of leftover inventory at the end of the period. The third term represents the expected shortage cost when demand exceeds the stocking quantity. The last term is the cost of stocking s units. Using integration by parts and substituting ∫ϕ(θ, s)dθ = Φ(θ, s) in Eq. (1), we get

The objective in this paper is to compute the optimal shelf-space stocking quantity which maximizes the expected profit Π(s) with uncertain demand. However, in this paper, the uncertainty of demand is exogenous as well as supply driven. The stocking quantity affects the probability of demand; and, the probability of observing a higher demand increases with higher supply (displayed quantity)—first order stochastic dominance (

In Eq. (5), availability effect indicates the change in revenue with the stocking level supply; while, the stimulation effect indicates the change in revenue due to the stimulated demand with the stocking level. Proposition 2.1 gives the optimal service level which means that it is optimal to have stocking level with the probability Φ(θ ≤ s
                        *, s
                        *) (or stock out with the probability (1 − Φ(θ ≤ s
                        *, s
                        *)). At s
                        *, any marginal increase in stocking level may result in demand stimulation. This will increase the cost of understocking by

To better illustrate Propositions 2.1 and 2.5, we construct a numerical example and validate our model. The demand function can be expressed as, θ = αsβ, α > 0, 0 < β < 1. It is quite obvious that the values of α and β depend on many factors, some of which are discussed by Koschat (2008) through empirical findings. However, α and β only contribute to the sensitivity of the demand function with respect to the stocking quantity and as such they do not affect the basic results of our model. Without any loss of generality we consider a square root demand: α = 1 and β = 1/2. With the following parameters: demand is normally distributed with mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ = 25, selling price p = 500, holding cost h = 20, shortage cost b = 40 and production cost c = 100. Using the expected profit function (Eq. (1)), we calculate the optimal stocking quantity as s
                     * = 134.27 and the corresponding service level which is 0.8179. With the same set of parameters, the classical newsvendor model suggests a service level of 0.7857 which is lower than 0.8179. Therefore the demand stimulation effect cannot be ignored.

The analysis of service level which has two components namely availability effect and stimulation effect, shows that when s is smaller, the stimulation effect is negative resulting in lost opportunity of higher sales. Beyond a point the stimulation effect is always positive due to which the service level for the ILDD model is always greater than the service level for the classical newsvendor model. Interestingly, beyond s
                     * the stimulation effect decreases with an increasing rate. This has important implications for the retailers. It provides a bound on the inventory to be displayed on the shelf. This behavior is further investigated in the Section 3.1.

                         gives different values of s
                        * and Φ(θ ≤ s
                        *, s
                        *) for both the ILDD model and the classical newsvendor model.

We find that for the same set of parameters, the optimal stocking quantity and hence the service level is always higher in case of the ILDD model than the classical newsvendor model. It clearly shows the effect of demand stimulation by displayed inventory on the shelf. As described earlier, the ILDD model service level has two components: availability effect, and stimulation effect. We investigate the behavior of the service level and its components with respect to the selling price and the shortage cost. The analysis is presented in Tables 2
                         and 3
                        . Through this analysis, we are able to determine the impact of demand stimulation on the service level and differentiate with the classical newsvendor service level. The response of stimulation effect on the stocking quantity can also be observed from these results.


                        Table 2 shows that when the selling price increases, it induces the retailer to stock more thereby increasing the availability effect as well as the stimulation effect. The net result is an increase in the service level. However, the stimulation effect increases with a decreasing rate. Table 3 indicates that when the shortage cost increases, the retailer would stock more to achieve a better service level. In this case the stimulation effect is found to be decreasing while the availability effect increases with the increase in the shortage cost. The net result is again an increase in the service level. However, in contrast to the earlier case, the stimulation effect decreases with a decreasing rate.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this research, we develop a profit maximization retail shelf-space stocking policy under stochastic demand that is influenced by both exogenous and endogenous factors. We define an optimal service level when shelf space inventories play dual role of providing service level and stimulating demand. From managerial perspective and research contribution, our result is analogous to the classical newsvendor critical fractile with additional and significant insights under supply-driven demand uncertainty.

For the retailer, by choosing s < s
                     *, the demand stimulation may be low resulting in lost opportunity of higher sales. For s > s
                     *, high demand stimulation may lead to more shortages. Our analysis captures the endogenous impact of stocking policy on the realized demand; and, shows that, at s = s
                     *, the trade-offs mentioned are balanced. We validate the model through a numerical experiment and provide the optimal shelf space allocation in the presence of demand simulation. The sensitivity analysis on the key modelling parameters provides several interesting insights for retailers.

When there is incomplete information about the utility functions, the concept of stochastic dominance can be used to rank the alternatives. As mentioned in Proposition 2.4, for increasing utility functions, if X dominates Y under first order stochastic dominance, then Eu(X) ≥ Eu(Y). This is independent of risk characteristics of the retailer. In this paper, we assume that the retailer is risk neutral; however, the analysis is valid even if the retailer is risk averse or risk seeking with an increasing utility function.
