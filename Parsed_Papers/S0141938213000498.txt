The structure and morphology of materials were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The morphologies of SrTiO3:Eu3+, CaTiO3:Eu3+ or CaTiO3:Pr3+ powders co-doped with other metal ions were very similar. Small and coagulated particles of nearly cubical shapes with small size distribution having smooth and regular surface were formed. Photo-luminescence spectra of CaTiO3:Pr3+ and co-doped either with Li+, Na+, K+, Ag+, La3+ or Gd3+ ions showed red emissions at 613nm due to the 1D2

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recently, the MTiO3 (M=Ca or Sr) perovskites have attracted considerable attention as an important class of mixed oxides with various applications owing to their physical properties as candidates for electro-optical devices. Calcium titanate (CT) ceramics are excellent applicants for use as dielectric resonators in wireless communication system [1]. In addition, CT exhibits a high permittivity of 160, accompanied however by a large positive temperature coefficient of resonant frequency value (+850ppm/°C) [2]. On the other hand strontium titanate (SrTiO3) has its potential applications, such as dynamic random access memory, tunable microwave devices, photocatalysts and photoelectrodes for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen [3–5]. Rare earth ions are used to dope perovskite-type oxides as a probe to investigate local centers and energy [6,7] promoting changes in the optical behavior [8], or improve the capacitance response of these materials making possible their use as high frequency ultrasonic transducers [9]. Eu3+ and Pr3+ ions have significant importance due to their potential application as red phosphors, electroluminescent devices, optical amplifiers and lasers, as dopants in a great variety of materials [10,11]. In order to enhance the luminescence properties, many researchers have concentrated on varying the concentration of praseodymium or europium, charge compensators like Al3+, In3+, Ga3+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Li+ ions [7–15] and synthesis methods [16–19]. In many applications like photocatalysts and phosphors, MTiO3 nano particles with narrow size distribution, non-agglomeration and spherical morphology are preferred [20].

It is well known that the preparative methods have important effects on material microstructure and physical properties. The combustion synthesis method had been used earlier by us to prepare phosphor materials of ZrO2, BaZrO3 and MLn2O4 (M=Ba or Sr, Ln=Gd or La) doped with Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions [21,22]. This method provides an interesting alternative over other elaborated techniques because it offers several advantages such as: simplicity of experimental set-up; surprisingly short time between the preparation of reactants and the availability of the final product; and being cheap due to energy saving. The main advantage of this method is the rapid decomposition of the rare earth nitrate in the presence of an organic fuel. During the reaction, many gases, such as CO2, N2, NO2 and H2O, with enormous heat are released in a short period of time before the process terminates with white, foamy and crispy products. Moreover, final products are found to be composed of nanosized particles. Present work has been carried out with the aim to prepare and compare the high intensity photoluminescence nano-sized crystalline powders of CaTiO3 and SrTiO3 doped with Eu3+ or Pr3+ and co-doped with charge compensators like Li+ or Na+ or Ag+ or K+ or Gd3+ or La3+ etc, after sintering at 1000°C. The effect of different charge compensator ions in perovskites lattices has been proposed to enhance the luminescence intensity as well as the possible mechanism. The crystalline structure and morphology of prepared materials have also been discussed. The crystalline structure of prepared materials, morphology of particles and their photoluminescence properties are characterized by XRD, SEM and emission spectroscopy.

High purity TiO2, [Ca(NO3)2], [Sr(NO3)2], [Eu(NO3)3], [Pr(NO3)3], [La(NO3)3], [Gd(NO3)3], NaNO3, KNO3, LiNO3, AgNO3 and Hexamethylenetetraamine [HMTA] were purchased from Aldrich chemicals as starting materials. Eu3+ or Pr3+ and N+ or N3+ doped nanocrystals (N=Li, Na, K, Ag, La, Gd) with general formula (1−2x) CaTiO3 
                     x Pr3+, x N+ or 3+, and (1−6x)Sr (or Ca)TiO3 5x Eu3+, x N+ where x is 1 mole%, were prepared by heating an aqueous concentrated paste rapidly, containing calculated amounts of metal nitrates and HMTA in a preheated furnace maintained at 500°C. HMTA was used as a fuel and its amount was calculated using total oxidizing and reducing valences [23]. In such cases, the material undergoes rapid dehydration and foaming followed by decomposition, generating combustible gases. These volatile combustible gases ignite and burn with a flame, yielding a voluminous solid. In the present case, the combustion process utilized the enthalpy of combustion for the formation of the required solid material and the solid thus obtained was again fired at 1000°C for 3h to increase the brightness and crystallinity.

The morphologies of the prepared crystals were studied by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) using a JEOL JSM6300 operating at 10kV. Photoluminescence (PL) experiments were performed in backscattering geometry using a He–Cd laser (325nm) with an optical power of 30mW for excitation. The emitted light was analyzed by HR-4000 Ocean Optics USB spectrometer optimized for the UV–Vis range. For photoluminescence measurements, 0.05g powder samples were pressed into pellets (10mm diameter and 1mm thickness) and then exposed to a 325 nm He–Cd laser. All measurements were carried out at room temperature. The structural characterization of the solids was performed by high resolution XRD using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer in the θ–2θ configuration and using CuKα radiation (1.54184Å).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

XRD patterns of the as-prepared CaTiO3:Eu3+, CaTiO3:Pr3+ and SrTiO3:Eu3+ powders and co-doped with N+ or N3+ (N=Li or Na or K or Ag or Gd or La) are shown in Fig. 1
                        a–c.

In Fig. 1a diffraction peaks of CaTiO3 doped with 5% Eu3+ and 1% of Li+ or Na+ or K+ correspond to CaTiO3 (orthorhombic crystal system with Pnma (62) space group). This matched with PDF card number: 042-0423. There is another phase of Eu2O3 (PDF C.No.034-0392) that belongs to cubic crystal system with la3 (206) space group. The presence of separate Eu2O3 phase shows a partial incorporation of Eu3+ ions in CaTiO3 lattice. However, the CaTiO3 samples doped with 1% Pr3+ and co-doped with 1% Li+ or Na+ or Ag+ or K+ or Gd3+ or La3+ show only a single orthorhombic crystal phase (Fig. 1b).

Apart from these main crystalline phases, some low intensity lines can be observed in the 2Θ region between 25° and 32°. The assignment of such lines is not straightforward and can correspond to residuals phases of some elements used in the synthesis such as CaCO3 or even to other combinations of Ca, Ti and O elements.

None of the other phases related to the rest of doping impurities was detected, indicating that the doping ions were occupying the Ca2+ sites. Almost identical patterns are obtained within each Fig. 1a and b. This indicates that the co–doping of N+ or N3+ ions with Eu3+ or Pr3+does not affect the structure of CaTiO3 significantly because the ionic radii of Eu3+ and Pr3+ (94.7 and 99pm respectively in coordination number6) do not differ with that of Ca2+ (100pm, coordination number=6). These ions are likely to substitute for Ca2+ ion in CaTiO3 and act as luminescence centers [24,25]. The substitution of Eu3+ or Pr3+ for Ti4+ ions is very much unlikely due to large difference of ionic size with Ti4+ (60.5pm, coordination number=6). However in CaTiO3:Eu3+ or Pr3+, the other co-doped ions like Li+, Na+, Ag+, K+, Gd3+ and La3+ having ionic radii 76, 102, 129, 138, 93 and 103pm respectively are also incorporated in CaTiO3 lattice successfully although Li+, Ag+ and K+ have large difference in ionic radii from that of Ca2+. Due to this difference of ionic radii of co-doped ions, the CaTiO3 lattices had slight deformations which lead to the variation in the heights of diffraction peaks in their patterns. The effect of the incorporation of co-doped ions on CaTiO3:Eu3+ or Pr3+ lattices had also been investigated to study the photo-luminescent behavior of the lattices. As the ionic radius of Li+ ion is smaller, there is a possibility of some of the ions to reside in interstitial sites between or among the host ions. This observation can be assigned to the enormous changes in lattice constants of these samples. The unit-cell constants and unit cell volumes of CaTiO3:Eu3+ or Pr3+ samples as well as co-doped with other ions are calculated from the distance between the adjacent (200), (020) and (002) planes corresponding to direction peaks near 2θ
                        =32.95°, 23.24° and 33.12° and are listed in Table 1
                        .

It is obvious that if the ions with larger radius substitute the smaller cations in the crystalline lattice, the cell volume of the host compound is increased [26,27]. Therefore, as shown in Table 1, the cell volumes of CaTiO3:Eu3+, Na+ and CaTiO3:Eu3+, K+ after doping with Na+ and K+ ions increased, but decreased with the doping of Li+ due to its smaller size. The cell volumes of CaTiO3:Pr3+, co-doped with mono-valent ions also follow the sequence as:

                        which is in accordance with the increase in size of co-doped ions. Similarly the larger cell volume of CaTiO3:Pr3+, La3+ than CaTiO3:Pr3+, Gd3+ further support this argument.

All the diffraction peaks in Fig. 1c can be indexed to the cubic unit cell of SrTiO3. The samples have a single-phase perovskite structure with a lattice constant of a
                        =3.9050Å. This is in good agreement with the standard JCPDS files (005-0634). It is worth noting that there is no impurity phase associated with the 5% doping of Eu3+ and 1% co-doping of Li+ or Na+ or K+ in all samples of SrTiO3. This indicates that the co-doping of alkali metal ions with Eu3+ does not affect the structure of SrTiO3 significantly, in spite of the fact the ionic radii of Eu3+, Li+, Na+ and K+ (94.7, 76, 102 and 138 respectively in coordination number=6) are different from that of Sr2+ (118pm, coordination number=6). These ions are likely to substitute Sr2+ ion in SrTiO3. In order to investigate the effect of the incorporation of co-doped ions on SrTiO3:Eu3+ structures the corresponding unit-cell constants and unit cell volumes of SrTiO3:Eu3+ samples as well as co-doped with alkali metal ions have been calculated from the distance between the adjacent (110) planes corresponding to direction peaks near 2θ
                        =32.38°, as listed in Table 1. Here again the cell volume of SrTiO3:Eu3+ lattice increased with the substitution of larger sized ions like Na+ and K+ but remained same with the co-doping of Li+ ion. This indicates the substitution of Li+ at interstitial position as well as the normal site. The substitution of Li+ at Ti4+ site is possible if size is only the consideration, but as charge difference is quite large and its substitution causes more point defects in crystallites as a consequence the decrease in PL property as compared to SrTiO3:Eu3+ material. But the PL property has increased only with the co-doping of Li+ in SrTiO3:Eu3+ or CaTiO3:Eu3+ (discussed in next section), therefore the substitution of Li+ is very much likely at Sr2+ or Ca2+ and interstitially in SrTiO3:Eu3+ or CaTiO3:Eu3+.

Crystallinity, particle size and surface roughness of the phosphor have strong effects on the photoluminescence. In Fig. 2
                        a–d, the SEM images of CaTiO3 and SrTiO3 doped with Eu3+ or Pr3+ and co-doped with other ions show good smooth uniformity and dense microstructures. However there are several pores observed in each SEM image which are formed by the escaping gases during the combustion reaction. This feature is inherent in combustion derived powders. The agglomerated particles with nearly cubical shape in all SEM images are observed. The average size as calculated from Scherrer equation from the main XRD peaks at 23.21, 33.11 and 47.49 for all CaTiO3 samples is between 40 and 50nm and is in good agreement as calculated from the SEM images. The average size of SrTiO3 crystallites were calculated from the two main XRD peaks corresponding to 32.42 and 46.48 and was found to be 35±5nm. This is again in good agreement with the size of particles in their SEM images.

                        a presents the PL spectra of CaTiO3:Pr3+ and co-doped with Li+ or Na+ or K+ or Ag+ or La3+or Gd3+ ions. The emission spectra were obtained by exciting samples with UV light at 325nm. The synthesized products emitted red luminescence with varying intensities, which showed the activator Pr3+ and co activators had successfully entered the host lattice of CaTiO3. The PL spectra show the intensity calibrated red emissions peaking around 613nm due to the1D2
                        →
                        3H4 transition of Pr3+. The variation in intensity of emission peaks with different co-doping follows the order: K+
                        >Ag+
                        >Na+
                        >Li+
                        >La3+
                        >Gd3+. The optical performances of Pr3+-doped calcium titanates depend critically on charge compensation. In air-fired donor perovskites like CaTiO3:Pr3+, the charge compensation occurs by the formation of intrinsic defects such as negatively charged Ca vacancies, positively charged oxygen vacancies and/or by reduction of Ti4+–Ti3+ 
                        [28–30]. Associations of Ti3+ defects and oxygen vacancies can also be anticipated, leading to neutral or singly ionized centers. Several of these defects are undesirable because their presence in the phosphors, even at low concentration, can contribute to quench the Pr3+ centered luminescence. Firstly, a part of the red emission can be re-absorbed in the broad d→d absorption band of Ti3+. Secondly, it can be expected that the positively charged defects act as traps for electrons promoted in the conduction band after band gap excitation. This electron capture constitutes an alternative radiationless de-excitation channel that competes with the energy transfer to the excited levels of Pr3+ and contributes to decrease the intensity of the 4f→4f emission. In this scheme, the role of charge compensation is to limit the concentration of these undesirable defects in the phosphors, leading consequently to the reinforcement of the optical performances. The self-compensation has also been observed in Sm2O3, Y2O3, and Ho2O3 doped BaTiO3 ceramics [31–35]. The addition of La3+ or Gd3+ in CaTiO3:Pr3+ reduces the point defects, such as Ca2+ and Ti4+ vacancies, which act as non-radiative quenching centers for the 1D2 transition, thus enhancing the red emission efficiency [32]. Two to three fold increase of PL intensity is observed in the present samples of CaTiO3:Pr3+ when co-doped with Gd3+ and La3+. The enhancement of photoluminescence is almost four to five times when samples of CaTiO3:Pr3+ are co-doped with monovalent ions like Li+ or Na+ or K+ or Ag+. The increased PL intensity for mono-valent ions in comparison to trivalent ions suggests that there may be another factor in addition to charge compensation responsible for this enhancement. Yang et al. [36] observed that the incorporation of mono-valent ions creates oxygen vacancies, which might act as a sensitizer for effective energy transfer due to strong mixing of charge transfer states. Further, co-doping of the mono-valent ions also control the morphology and grain size of the phosphors. The increased crystallinity of materials leads to higher oscillating strength for optical transitions. Thus it seems more probable that mono-valent ions co doping not only decrease the surface defects but also facilitate the energy transfer from host to Pr3+. The ionic radii of mono-valent ions follow the sequence K+
                        >Ag+
                        >Na+
                        >Li+, which is also the sequence of increase of PL intensity in case of CaTiO3:Pr3+ co-doped with mono-valent ions. It seems that larger the radius of monovalent ion more easily is the energy transfer process from host lattice to Pr3+ion.

The room temperature emission spectra of Eu3+ doped CaTiO3 and SrTiO3 crystals and co-doped with Li+, Na+ or K+ are shown in Fig. 3b and c. The emission spectra were obtained again by monitoring an excitation of ultraviolet light at 325nm. The obtained products emitted the red

                        .

The 5D0
                        →
                        7F1 transition is well known to be mainly a magnetic dipole transition when the Eu3+ ions locate in a high symmetric position while the 5D0
                        →
                        7F2,4 transitions are essentially electric dipole transitions which appear dominantly only when Eu3+ ion locates at sites without inversion symmetry [37,38]. Furthermore, it was noted that the transition line of 5D0
                        →
                        7F1 did not split as was expected for symmetry group Oh. In these sites, electric dipole transition, such as 5D0
                        →
                        7F2, is forbidden [39]. In accordance to the selection rule, if Eu3+ ion locates in symmetric position, optical transitions between the 4F
                           n
                         configurations are strictly forbidden. However, if lattice vibrations of the host lattice reduce the symmetry of Eu3+, the 5D0
                        →
                        7F2 transition would be observed due to the breakdown of the selection rule. Therefore Eu3+ must locate in the site with the inversion symmetry such as Ca2+ or Sr2+ site. The co-doping of Li+ in Eu3+ doped CaTiO3 and SrTiO3 crystals produced an enhancement of emission intensity while the effect is negligible for Na+ and K+ doping. As stated above, the role of mono-valent charge compensators is to decrease the intrinsic defects as well as to facilitate the energy transfer from host to charge transfer states. In the present case it seems that only Li+ is the only effective compensator for Eu3+ doped CaTiO3 and SrTiO3 lattices. The reason for this may be calculated from the asymmetry ratio of electric and magnetic dipole transitions. The intensity ratio of 5D0
                        →
                        7F2 to 5D0

                        7F1 transitions represents the asymmetry ratio (R) around Eu3+, and this asymmetry structure site can benefit photo-luminescence. The asymmetry ratio is expressed as [40]:

The asymmetry ratio of the Eu3+ site is about 2 for Li+ co-doped phosphors while for others it is around one, which means that the electric dipole transition is twice as strong as the magnetic dipole transition. With Li+ doping the symmetry of the local environment of Eu3+ decreases, which strengthens the transition from energy level 5D0 to energy level 7F2. As the size of Na+ and K+ are comparable to the size of Ca2+ or Sr2+, so they will occupy the Ca or Sr sites. But the size of Li+ ion is quite small and its substitution in interstitial site is also equally probable as of normal site. The interstitial substitution will lead to lesser symmetric environment around Eu3+ centers. The evidence of interstitial substitution has already been obtained from the decrease of cell volumes of Li+ doped CaTiO3:Eu3+ and SrTiO3:Eu3+ lattices.

If the emission spectra of Li+ co-doped CaTiO3:Eu3+ and SrTiO3:Eu3+ materials are compared (Fig. 3d), the relative intensities of all emission peaks for SrTiO3:Eu3+ are more than twice than that of CaTiO3:Eu3+. Low emission intensity of Eu3+ ions in CaTiO3:Eu3+, Li+ may be due to partial substitution of Eu3+ ions in CaTiO3 lattice as evident from the presence of Eu2O3 phase in the material. However, the relative positions of all emission peaks in both materials remain at the same position showing the existence of similar environment for Eu3+ ions in CaTiO3 and SrTiO3 lattices.

Therefore it may be concluded that the increase of luminescence intensity by trivalent charge compensators in CaTiO3:Pr3+ phosphor is due to decrease of radiationless energy transfers centers like the point defects and while the mono-valent ions not only decrease the point defects but also facilitate the energy transfer from host to Pr3+ ions. The effect of charge compensation to increase the luminescence intensity is observed only for Li+ ion for CaTiO3:Eu3+ and SrTiO3:Eu3+ lattices. The probable reason for this may be the interstitial substitution of these ions due to their smaller size. This might be decreasing the symmetry around the Eu3+ ion and strengthening the electric dipole transitions.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Ca (or Sr)TiO3:Eu3+, N+ (Li+ or Na+ or K+) and CaTiO3:Pr3+, N+ or N3+ (N=Li or Na or Ag or K or Gd or La) powders prepared by combustion synthesis method and further heating to ∼1000°C improved the crystallinity of the phosphor materials. XRD analysis showed that cubic phase is mainly present in SrTiO3:Eu3+, N+ (Li+ or Na+ or K+) samples; orthorhombic crystal phase in CaTiO3:Pr3+, N (Li+ or Na+ or K+ or Gd3+ or La3+) and cubic Eu2O3 phase along with orthorhombic main phase detected in CaTiO3:Eu3+, N+ (Li+ or Na+ or K+) powders. The average particle size of synthesized materials is between 30 and 50nm. The increase of luminescence intensity by trivalent charge compensators in CaTiO3:Pr3+ phosphor is due to decrease of radiationless energy transfers centers like the point defects and while the mono-valent ions not only decrease the point defects but also facilitate the energy transfer from host to Pr3+ ions. A remarkable increase in the photoluminescence intensity by co-doping with Li+ metal ions in CaTiO3:Eu3+ and SrTiO3:Eu3+ lattices was observed due to reduction of environment symmetry around Eu3+ ions which confirmed the electric dipole transition.
