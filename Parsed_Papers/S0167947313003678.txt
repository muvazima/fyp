                  Simulation-based forecasting methods for a non-Gaussian noncausal vector autoregressive (VAR) model are proposed. In noncausal autoregressions the assumption of non-Gaussianity is needed for reasons of identifiability. Unlike in conventional causal autoregressions the prediction problem in noncausal autoregressions is generally nonlinear, implying that its analytical solution is unfeasible and, therefore, simulation or numerical methods are required in computing forecasts. It turns out that different special cases of the model call for different simulation procedures. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that gains in forecasting accuracy are achieved by using the correct noncausal VAR model instead of its conventional causal counterpart. In an empirical application, a noncausal VAR model comprised of U.S. inflation and marginal cost turns out superior to the best-fitting conventional causal VAR model in forecasting inflation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The conventional vector autoregressive (VAR) model has become a standard tool in various fields of applications. In economics and finance the VAR model is typically used in structural analysis to study the dynamics and interrelationships between variables of interest. Another application of the VAR model is forecasting. For instance, economic decision makers, such as central banks and investors in financial markets, aim to forecast key macroeconomic and financial time series to assess the future state of the economy and investment opportunities.

The conventional causal VAR model has a moving average representation in terms of its present and past error terms. A characteristic feature of this model is that its error terms are not predictable by past values of the involved time series. In contrast, the moving average representation of the non-Gaussian noncausal VAR model recently considered by Davis and Song (2010) and Lanne and Saikkonen (2013) also involve future error terms that are predictable by past values of the considered time series. In addition to theoretical advancements these authors demonstrate the practical usefulness of the noncausal VAR model in economic and financial applications. As discussed by Lanne and Saikkonen (2013), an important economic application of the noncausal VAR model is checking the validity of widely used test procedures based on the causal VAR model in testing economic hypotheses, especially in models involving expectations.

As yet, the development of the noncausal VAR model is at its early stages and even the literature of univariate noncausal autoregressive models is scant (see Breidt et al., 1991, Rosenblatt, 2000, Davis and Song, 2010, Lanne and Saikkonen, 2011, 2013 and the references therein). As demonstrated in this previous literature, noncausal autoregressions can be distinguished from their causal counterparts only when the data generation process is non-Gaussian. In noncausal autoregressions non-Gaussianity can therefore be seen as a necessary identification condition. The object of this paper is to devise forecasting techniques for the non-Gaussian noncausal VAR model of Lanne and Saikkonen (2013). In addition to computing forecasts these techniques are also needed in computing impulse response functions, and hence in conducting structural analysis within the noncausal VAR model. Thus, our contribution should widen the applicability of the noncausal VAR model in empirical research.

In the causal VAR model, forecasting is simple in that explicit formulas are available. In the noncausal VAR model the situation is different because the prediction problem is, in general, nonlinear and, consequently, forecasts cannot be obtained without resorting to numerical methods. Further discussion on this point is provided by Lanne et al. (2012b) who develop a simulation-based forecasting method for the univariate noncausal AR model proposed by Lanne and Saikkonen (2011). It turns out that forecasts of the noncausal VAR model considered in this paper can be computed analogously only when a suitable condition on the structure of the model holds. One case where the required condition always holds is the purely noncausal VAR model whose moving average representation only involves present and future error terms. In general, the required condition states that a certain parameter matrix involving the autoregressive coefficients of the model is nonsingular. Due to estimation errors this nonsingularity always holds in practice but, to avoid potential problems with nearly singular cases, we develop a forecasting technique which does not depend on the structure of the model. To achieve this robustness, more demanding computations based on importance sampling are needed. A somewhat similar technique has recently been used by Breidt and Hsu (2005) in forecasting non-Gaussian and potentially noninvertible (univariate) moving average processes (for a general discussion of importance sampling, see, e.g., Geweke, 1996).

We examine the properties of our forecasting techniques by means of Monte Carlo simulations which also provide guidance for some user-chosen quantities needed in the application of these techniques. The simulations conducted demonstrate that our forecasting techniques perform well and that the correct noncausal VAR model outperforms its causal counterpart in forecast accuracy.

Although empirical experience of noncausal VAR models is still very limited, the findings of Lanne et al. (2012c) based on applying univariate autoregressions to a large economic data set suggest that noncausality is quite prevalent among economic time series (see also Lof, 2013). The related work of Lanne et al. (2012a) and Lanne et al. (2012b) complement these findings by demonstrating that the univariate noncausal AR model outperforms its conventional causal counterpart in forecasting US inflation. Our empirical application to inflation forecasting is partly motivated by the work of these previous authors. We consider a bivariate system consisting of inflation and the real marginal cost that has often been employed in monetary economics, especially in studies related to the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (see, e.g., Gali and Gertler, 1999, Nason and Smith, 2008, and the references therein). Our results are similar to those obtained by Lanne et al. (2012a,b). We find that a noncausal VAR model provides the best in-sample fit and outperforms the best-fitting causal VAR model in out-of-sample forecasting.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section  2 describes the noncausal VAR model of Lanne and Saikkonen (2013) and briefly discusses statistical inference. Section  3 develops the forecasting techniques of the paper, while Section  4 illustrates their performance by Monte Carlo simulations. Section  5 presents the empirical application. Section  6 concludes. Finally, some technical details are collected in four appendices.

In this section, we first describe the noncausal VAR model of Lanne and Saikkonen (2013) and then discuss briefly parameter estimation and statistical inference. Unless otherwise indicated, all vectors will be treated as column vectors and, for notational convenience, we shall write

                         is a stationary and ergodic process with finite second moments.

Model (1) is referred to as the VAR(
                           r
                           ,
                           s
                        ) model. In the conventional causal case the abbreviation VAR(
                           r
                        ) is also used. In the next section, we present the joint distribution of an observed time series generated by the VAR(
                           r
                           ,
                           s
                        ) process. This joint distribution is needed in the development of our forecasting methods and it also facilitates our discussion on parameter estimation and statistical inference.

As discussed in the Introduction, causal and noncausal autoregressions cannot be distinguished by second-order properties or the Gaussian likelihood. Therefore, it is necessary to assume that the error term 
                           
                              
                                 ϵ
                              
                              
                                 t
                              
                           
                          is non-Gaussian. The theoretical results of Lanne and Saikkonen (2013) assume that the distribution of 
                           
                              
                                 ϵ
                              
                              
                                 t
                              
                           
                          is of a fairly general elliptical form. However, an inspection of the arguments used in Section  3.1 of that paper reveals that this assumption is not needed to derive the distribution of the observed data and, therefore, it is not necessary for our forecasting methods. Thus, unless otherwise indicated we only assume that the (non-Gaussian) distribution of 
                           
                              
                                 ϵ
                              
                              
                                 t
                              
                           
                         is continuous with density function 
                           f
                           
                              (
                              ⋅
                              )
                           
                        , whose possible dependence on (unknown) parameters is not made explicit.

A detailed derivation of the joint distribution of the observed data can be found in Lanne and Saikkonen (2013), so here we only describe the final result. To this end, define the

We shall now briefly discuss parameter estimation and statistical inference in the VAR(
                           r
                           ,
                           s
                        ) model (1). Following Lanne and Saikkonen (2013) we here assume that the error term 
                           
                              
                                 ϵ
                              
                              
                                 t
                              
                           
                         has an elliptical distribution and use the second factor of the right hand side of (10) to obtain a computationally feasible approximation for the likelihood function. Maximizing this function over the permissible parameter space yields an (approximate) maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. Lanne and Saikkonen (2013) show that, under appropriate regularity conditions, the resulting (local) ML estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed and that conventional methods to compute standard errors for estimators and to construct likelihood-based tests apply.

The preceding discussion assumes that the orders 
                           r
                         and 
                           s
                         of the VAR(
                           r
                           ,
                           s
                        ) model (1) are known. As in Lanne and Saikkonen (2013) we specify these orders as follows. First, using least squares or Gaussian ML we find a causal VAR(
                           p
                        ) model that adequately describes the autocorrelation structure of the data with the order 
                           p
                         determined by using conventional procedures such as model selection criteria and diagnostic checks. Then we check the residuals of this causal VAR(
                           p
                        ) model for Gaussianity and, only when we detect deviations from Gaussianity, we consider noncausal VAR models. Next we choose a non-Gaussian error distribution, such as the multivariate 
                           t
                        -distribution used in Lanne and Saikkonen (2013), and estimate all causal and noncausal VAR(
                           r
                           ,
                           s
                        ) models with the orders 
                           r
                         and 
                           s
                         summing to the selected order 
                           p
                        . Finally, of these alternative models we choose the one that maximizes the likelihood function and evaluate its adequacy with conventional diagnostic tools.

In this section, we consider forecasting future observations

                      and, unless otherwise stated, we shall assume that the model is not causal and not univariate, so that

In the purely noncausal case these error terms vanish from the right hand side of (11), simplifying the situation and allowing a straightforward extension of the forecasting method of Lanne et al. (2012b). Therefore, and also to help understand the difficulties in the general case (

To overcome the difficulty described above we first develop a procedure that is generally applicable but requires the use of importance sampling not needed in the purely noncausal case considered in the preceding section. In Section  3.2.2, we show how a simpler technique, similar to that derived in the purely noncausal case, can be obtained when a suitable condition about the structure of the model holds. When 
                           s
                           =
                           1
                         this condition requires that the matrix

Numerical solutions for the integrals on the right hand side of (23) can be obtained but techniques more complicated than in the preceding section or in Lanne et al. (2012b) seem to be required. As in Breidt and Hsu (2005), where an analogous forecasting procedure for (univariate) noninvertible moving average models is developed, one can employ an importance sampling technique (see, e.g., Section 4.3 of Geweke, 1996).

                            is unknown and has to replaced by an estimate which, due to estimation errors, is necessarily nonsingular (with probability one). Moreover, a simulated example provided in the next section suggests that, even when the assumed nonsingularity does not hold, the forecasting procedure to be derived in this section performs well compared to its robust but computationally more demanding alternative developed in the previous section. Note also that in practice one can assess the possible singularity of

This simulation procedure is similar to that derived in the purely noncausal case in Section  3.1 to which it, in fact, reduces in that special case (for a detailed discussion of this issue, see Appendix A.3).

In this section, we examine the performance of our forecasting techniques by using Monte Carlo simulations and data generation processes (DGPs) based on bivariate models estimated for real data. The same data set, comprised of quarterly US inflation and the real marginal cost, is also used in the next section to provide an illustration of our forecasting techniques. As mentioned in the Introduction, inflation and the real marginal cost are variables extensively studied in the previous literature, although instead of the real marginal cost other variables have also been considered along with inflation (see, e.g., Gali and Gertler, 1999, Canova, 2007, Nason and Smith, 2008, Gefang et al., 2012, and the references in therein).

Our quarterly data set, from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED databank, covers the period from 1955:1 to 2010:3. Inflation is computed as the log-difference of the seasonally adjusted GDP implicit price deflator and the real marginal cost is approximated by the real unit labor cost (for details, see Lanne and Luoto, 2013). We use the period from 1955:1 to 1989:4 to estimate VAR(
                           r
                           ,
                           s
                        ) models that will serve as DGPs in the subsequent Monte Carlo simulations. Throughout this paper, GAUSS 10 and its BHHH optimization routine in the CMLMT package are employed in estimation, simulation, and forecasting.

To specify a potentially noncausal VAR model we proceed along the lines discussed in Section  2.2 and first consider a Gaussian VAR(
                           p
                        ) model. The conventional model selection criteria AIC and BIC as well as autocorrelation functions of the residuals suggested the order 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                        . However, the assumption of Gaussian errors could be rejected by the 
                           Q
                           –
                           Q
                         plots of the residuals and, given uncorrelated residuals, by the clear autocorrelation in the squared residuals of the inflation equation. Thus, we consider second-order models, that is, VAR(
                           r
                           ,
                           s
                        ) models with 
                           r
                           +
                           s
                           =
                           2
                         and, to capture the fat tails of the residual distribution, we choose the (bivariate) 
                           t
                        -distribution for the errors.

In the previous literature, the typical reaction to autocorrelation in squared residuals of a conventional causal VAR model has been to augment the model with GARCH errors. However, as theoretically demonstrated by Lanne and Saikkonen (2013, Section 2.3), one can expect to find autocorrelation in squared residuals when a causal VAR model is fitted to data generated by a (non-Gaussian and) noncausal VAR process (the same applies to a noncausal VAR model whose orders are misspecified). Thus, a potentially viable alternative to augmenting a causal VAR model with GARCH errors is to consider a noncausal VAR model.

Of the second-order models the VAR(
                           0
                           ,
                           2
                        ) model maximizes the likelihood function but only marginally compared to the VAR(
                           1
                           ,
                           1
                        ) model, whereas in terms of residual diagnostics the VAR(
                           1
                           ,
                           1
                        ) model performs slightly better, as the residuals of the VAR(
                           0
                           ,
                           2
                        ) model appear conditionally heteroskedastic. In the VAR(

                           2
                        ) models, respectively) and, in the case of the VAR(
                           0
                           ,
                           2
                        ) model, their imposition considerably improves the rather imprecise estimation of the degrees-of-freedom parameter of the 
                           t
                        -distribution. The restrictions has no marked effect on the residual diagnostics of the two models but, interestingly, the maximum value of the likelihood function of the restricted VAR(
                           1
                           ,
                           1
                        ) model turns out to be slightly greater than that of the VAR(
                           0
                           ,
                           2
                        ) model. All in all, both of these restricted models perform reasonably well and will be used as DGPs in our simulation experiments and in the forecasting exercise of Section  5. The estimation results are presented in Table 1.  Below, we shall also consider the conventional causal VAR(2) model for comparison and, to see how our forecasting procedures work in a higher order case, a fourth-order model will be briefly discussed.

It may be worth noting that the restrictions employed in the noncausal models in Table 1 are imposed on purely statistical grounds. As they imply that neither leads nor lags of the marginal cost (

                        ) appear in the equation of inflation (
                           
                              
                                 y

                        ), one might think that the marginal cost has no effect on inflation forecasts. However, one should be cautious about making such an interpretation. To see the reason for this, consider the VAR(
                           0

                         presents the determinants of the mean-squared forecast error (MSFE) matrices (cf., e.g., Athanasopoulos and Vahid, 2008) obtained by simulating the VAR(

                        ) processes discussed in the preceding section with forecast horizons ranging from 1 to 8 periods. Results obtained for the MSFEs of the two individual forecasts are qualitatively very similar and available upon request. Overall, the results show that there is a clear improvement in forecast accuracy when the number of simulated realizations 
                           m
                         increases from 10000 to 100000 or 200000. The improvement is much smaller when 
                           m
                         increases from 200000 up to 500 000. Whether importance sampling is used (Section  3.2.1) or not (Section  3.2.2) has only a minor effect on the results obtained for the VAR(
                           1
                           ,
                           1
                        ) model. By and large, forecasts based on the correct assumption of the nonsingularity of the matrix

                         are slightly more accurate. Altogether the results suggest that, in practice, 
                           m
                           =
                           200
                           
                           000
                         is a reasonable choice. This is much more than needed in the univariate case where Lanne et al. (2012b) found the choice 
                           m
                           =
                           10
                           
                           000
                         to be sufficient.


                        Table 3
                         shows the determinants of MSFE matrices and the individual MSFEs of the (correct) VAR(

                           1
                        ) models relative to a (misspecified) causal VAR(2) model with Gaussian errors (using 
                           t
                        –distributed errors instead of Gaussian errors yields very similar results). In the case of the VAR(

                           ,
                           1
                        ) model both the importance-sampling-based forecasts (indicated by IS) and those based on the (correct) assumption of the nonsingularity of the matrix

                         are considered. The number of simulated realizations is 
                           m
                           =
                         200000. The relative determinants of the MSFE matrices are always below unity, implying that gains in the overall forecast accuracy of the two variables can be achieved by using the correct noncausal model instead of its causal representation. However, an inspection of the individual MSFEs indicates that the gains are mainly due to forecasting the first variable (
                           
                              
                                 y

                        ), whose relative MSFEs are below unity, whereas those of the second variable (
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 2
                                 t
                              
                           
                        ) lie around unity ranging between 0.995 and 1.004.

As a robustness check of our forecasting procedures we also examined DGPs obtained by estimating the parameters of the two models in Table 1 without imposing the zero restrictions in the simulated DGPs. The results were very similar to those reported in Tables 2 and 3, so that removing zero restrictions from the DGPs had no essential effect on forecasting accuracy (detailed results are available upon request).

Next we discuss results obtained with the smaller sample size 
                           T
                           =
                           100
                        . Without showing detailed results we first note that choosing the number of simulated realizations as 
                           m
                           =

                         was still found appropriate, and is used to obtain Table 4
                         which presents results similar to those in Table 3 for 
                           T
                           =
                           100
                        . The results of Table 4  show that the relative MSFEs between the noncausal models and the Gaussian VAR model are somewhat larger than reported in Table 3. This is most likely due to the fact that the use of the smaller sample size has increased the estimation uncertainty, thereby resulting in less accurate forecasts. Support for this perception is obtained by considering the MSFEs based on the true parameter values of the VAR(
                           0
                           ,

                           1
                        ) models instead of their estimates. For 
                           T
                           =
                           100
                         the use of the true parameter values gave, on average, about 10% smaller relative MSFEs for the individual forecasts than reported in Table 4. In the case of the determinant of the MSFE matrix the average differences were even close to 20%. For the larger sample size 
                           T
                           =
                           300
                         these differences were only about 5% at maximum, implying that the effect of estimation uncertainty on forecast accuracy is considerably larger for the smaller sample size 
                           T
                           =

As a small illustration of the potential consequences of (incorrectly) using the forecasting procedure of Section  3.2.2 when the matrix

                           ,
                           1
                        ) model with the coefficient matrices given at the beginning of Section  3.2. Table 5
                         reports the relative MSFEs between the two forecasting procedures with the number of simulated realizations 
                           m
                           =
                         200000 and with the sample sizes 
                           T
                           =
                           100
                         and 
                           T
                           =
                           300
                         (note that the simulation results are based on using estimates of 
                           
                              
                                 N

                         which are nonsingular, as discussed in Section  3.2.2). The results show that the differences between the two procedures are minor (the figures range between 0.997 and 1.005 for 
                           T
                           =
                           100
                         and 0.993 and 1.003 for 
                           T
                           =
                           300
                        ). This admittedly very limited simulation experiment suggests that, at least in the case 
                           r
                           =
                           s
                           =
                           1
                        , falsely relying on the nonsingularity assumption and employing the forecasting procedure of Section  3.2.2 is not critical. More evidence on this matter is needed, however, before any far-reaching conclusions can be drawn.

We also examined a fourth-order model to see how the two forecasting procedures derived in Section  3.2 perform in a higher-order case. The results are reported in Table 6
                         (due to heavier computations the number of replications is 5000 in these simulations). The DGPs were again estimated from the same data (AIC suggested order four for causal models with 
                           t
                        –distributed errors). Of the fourth-order models, a VAR(
                           1
                           ,
                           3
                        ) model maximized the likelihood function. However, according to estimation results, this model appeared overparameterized and did not perform well in terms of residual diagnostics. As the parameters

                        , were rather imprecisely estimated we restricted them to zero. These restrictions correspond to those used in the VAR(
                           0
                           ,
                           2
                        ) and VAR(

                        ) models above, and when they were imposed a reasonable fit was obtained. Thus, we use this restricted VAR(

                           ,

                         needed in importance sampling was chosen as described at the end of Section  3.2.2 (in this case, four times the density function of the bivariate 
                           t
                        –distributed error term

                                 t
                              
                           
                        ). Qualitatively the simulation results in Table 6 are similar to those obtained for the VAR(
                           1
                           ,
                           1
                        ) model in Table 3. In particular, whether importance sampling is used or not has no substantial effect on the forecast accuracy, and compared to the causal VAR(4) model the forecasts are more accurate.

In this section, we consider out-of-sample forecasting with the bivariate causal and noncausal VAR models introduced in Table 1. An issue of special interest is whether US inflation forecasts can also in the VAR framework be improved by allowing for noncausality, in accordance with the findings of Lanne et al. (2012a,b) based on univariate AR models. Their results may reflect the fact that omitted factors predictable by lagged values of inflation are contained in the error term of a univariate AR model and the error term of the noncausal AR model is predictable unlike its causal counterpart. As the real marginal cost included in our bivariate model could be such an omitted factor, it is of interest to see how inflation forecasts behave when the real marginal cost is explicitly included in the model.

We compute forecasts by using an expansive window of observations such that the models are re-estimated at each date with the estimation period augmented by one observation. Following Lanne et al. (2012b), the starting point of the out-of-sample forecasting period is set to 1990:1 and the last forecasts are computed for 2010:3, so that forecasts are computed for 83 quarters. Based on the simulation results of the previous section, the number of simulated realizations 
                        m

Based on the model selection results of the previous section we consider second-order models. Table 7
                      presents the individual MSFEs and determinants of the MSFE matrices for the causal VAR(2) models with Gaussian (VAR(2)-
                        N
                     ) and

First consider the inflation forecasts that we are mostly interested in. Table 7 shows that the VAR(
                        1
                        ,
                        1
                     ) model yields the smallest MSFEs except for the two-quarter horizon where it is slightly outperformed by the VAR(
                        0
                        ,
                        2
                     ) model. Moreover, irrespective of the forecast horizon, the VAR(
                        1
                        ,
                        1
                     ) model outperforms the two causal VAR(2) models of which the VAR(2)-
                        N
                      model performs better and it also performs quite well in comparison with the VAR(
                        1
                        ,
                        1
                     ) model when the forecast horizon is short. However, when the forecast horizon is four quarters or more the VAR(
                        1
                        ,
                        1
                     ) model is clearly superior. According to the test of Diebold and Mariano (1995) and West (1996) the differences in the forecast accuracy between the VAR(
                        1
                        ,
                        1
                     ) and Gaussian VAR(2) models for inflation are statistically significant in most cases, even at the 1% significance level. In line with the simulation results of the previous section, the differences between the two forecasting methods in the case of the VAR(
                        1
                        ,
                        1
                     ) model are negligible.

As far as forecasting the marginal cost is concerned, especially the Gaussian VAR(2) model performs slightly better than the noncausal models with the exception of one-quarter forecasts where the VAR(
                        0
                        ,
                        2
                     ) yields the smallest MSFEs. The differences are not statistically significant, however, and the determinants of the MSFE matrices reported in Table 7 show that the noncausal models produce the best overall forecasts. In particular, in terms of this criterion, the purely noncausal VAR(
                        0
                        ,
                        2
                     ) model yields the most accurate forecasts for one and two quarters ahead whereas the VAR(
                        1
                        ,
                        1
                     ) model is the best when the forecast horizon is longer.

As an illustration of obtaining interval forecasts we consider the one-step-ahead interval forecast of inflation. Fig. 1
                      depicts a one-quarter-ahead forecast of the conditional cumulative distribution function of inflation for the first quarter of 2008. The forecast is formed by using the VAR(
                        1
                        ,
                        1
                     ) model with the importance-sampling-based forecasting technique (see Section  3.2.1). Any interval forecast can be read off the forecast of the conditional cumulative distribution function. The dotted lines show the lower (−0.15%) and upper (3.50%) bounds of the 90% interval forecasts when the point forecast is 1.87% and the realized value is 1.77%. Thus, the 90% forecast interval contains the observed inflation rate.

To sum up, the results show that the noncausal models produce more accurate forecasts for US inflation than their causal alternatives, and this also holds for the bivariate system consisting of inflation and the marginal cost. However, causal models, especially the Gaussian model, perform slightly better than the noncausal models in forecasting the marginal cost.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have developed forecasting methods for the noncausal VAR model of Lanne and Saikkonen (2013). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make forecasting in noncausal VAR models practically feasible. Due to the nonlinear nature of the prediction problem explicit formulas to compute forecasts are not available and, therefore, our forecasting methods exploit simulation-based techniques. The needed techniques turned out to be more complex than in the univariate case of Lanne et al. (2012b) with the extent of complexity depending on the structure of the model. However, according to the simulation experiments conducted, the proposed forecasting methods perform quite well even in the most complicated case, where importance sampling is employed. They also appear feasible in practice, as illustrated by our empirical application where noncausal VAR models performed well in comparison with their causal counterparts.

By making forecasting in the noncausal VAR model of Lanne and Saikkonen (2013) feasible in practice this paper has paved the way for developing methods for structural analysis within these models, including the computation of impulse response functions. Lanne and Saikkonen (2013) have also pointed out that noncausality is closely related to possible nonfundamental solutions of theoretical economic and financial models such as Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models. As nonfundamentalness implies dependence on future error terms, it would be interesting to use the noncausal VAR model instead of the causal VAR model as a benchmark in assessing forecasting ability of DSGE models (cf. Rubaszek and Skrzypczynski, 2008).

                         are linearly independent. As the spectral density matrix of

                         is positive definite there can be no exact linear dependences between the components of the data vector

                        . Thus, as the vector 
                           
                              z

                              y
                           
                         by a nonsingular linear transformation (see the discussion preceding (10)) it follows that there can be no exact linear dependences between the components of

In this appendix, we demonstrate that in the purely noncausal case (
                           r
                           =
                           0
                        ) the forecasting technique derived in Section  3.2.2 reduces to that derived in Section  3.1. To simplify notation, we give details in the case
