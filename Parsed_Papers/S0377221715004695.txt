                  Container ships in a string may not have the same capacity. Therefore, the sequence of ships affects the number of containers that are delayed at export ports due to demand uncertainty, for instance, “a large ship, followed by a small ship, then another large ship, and finally another small ship” is better than “a large ship, followed by another large ship, then a small ship, and finally another small ship”. We hence aim to determine the sequence of the ships in a string to minimize the delay of containers, without requiring the probability distribution functions for the future demand. We propose three rules to identify an optimal or near-optimal string. The rules have been proved to be effective based on extensive numerical experiments. A rough estimation indicates that over 6 million dollars/year could be saved for all liner services in the world by optimizing the sequences of ships.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Liner shipping companies transport containerized cargoes on regularly scheduled services with fixed port rotations. The regular and reliable liner services make it possible for shippers (consigners or consignees) to arrange their production plans, manage their inventories, and arrange the delivery of final products (Wang, Meng, & Bell, 2013a). From shipping lines’ viewpoint, the capacities of the shipping services are fixed, at least in short terms. Hence, shipping lines try to attract as many cargoes as possible to fill up the slots on the ships.

Uncertainties in container shipment demand are one of the major challenges for planning and operating liner services. At the tactical level, the services must be determined before the future demand is revealed (Ng, 2014). At the operational level, the number of containers available for loading in a week from a shipper may be different from what she has committed to (Wang, Meng, & Liu, 2013b). There are a number of reasons for this. For example, the shipper’s production line is down and not enough products are assembled; or the shipper just changes her mind due to the changes in business environment. Fig. 1 shows the number of containers transported between four pairs of ports in each week of a year on a trans-Pacific and an Asia-Europe service operated by an Asia-based global shipping line. Although the demand (number of containers available for loading) and the number of containers transported are different, this figure is still a strong evidence of the randomness of demand.

To fill up ship slots, shipping lines adopt the strategy of overbooking (Ting & Tzeng, 2004). Similar to the airline industry, one rationale behind the practice of overbooking is the possible cancelations of reserved slots. Different from the airline industry, another rationale for shipping lines to overbook the capacities of the ships is that they can postpone the transportation of the containers. With very few exceptions, shipping lines almost never guarantee the date of delivery for containers (Fransoo & Lee, 2013). This makes it possible for shipping lines to accept more containers: if the number of containers available at a port is higher than the ship capacity, some of them will be transported in the next week. When the shipping market is down and hence shipping lines worry that they may not have enough demand in the next week, they tend to accept whatever shipping orders received. When shippers’ containers are stacked in the container yard of an export port because the ship that visits the port in that week is full, shippers will not be compensated explicitly. Nevertheless, shipping lines do incur intangible costs, e.g., loss of goodwill, because of the inferior services provided for the shippers. In addition, more yard space is required to storage the delayed containers (Zhen, Lee, & Chew, 2011). Moreover, when there are a large number of delayed containers from the previous week, the handling time at port is longer, which affects the berth allocation by port operators (Bierwirth & Meisel, 2010; Imai, Nishimura, & Papadimitriou, 2001; Jin, Lee, & Hu, 2015; Robenek, Umang, Bierlaire, & Ropke, 2014; Türkoğulları, Taşkın, Aras, & Altınel, 2014; Xu, Li, & Leung, 2012).

Deploying larger ships will reduce the average delay of containers under uncertain demand. However, larger ships have higher operating and voyage costs. Another possible approach, which is almost costless, is to optimize the sequence of ships in the string. Suppose that six ships are deployed on a trans-Pacific service, the capacity of ships 1, 2, and 3 being 8, 000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) and the capacity of ships 4, 5, and 6 being 8, 200 TEUs. Since the demand is random and may exceed 8, 000 or even 8, 200 TEUs in some weeks, some containers that are available for loading in a week will have to wait for the ship that comes in the next week. Intuitively, the sequence of the string of ships 1 → 4 → 2 → 5 → 3 → 6 should outperform the string 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6, as the capacity distribution of the former is more “uniform” and can thereby dissolve the now-and-then high demand more efficiently.

In reality, although shipping lines seek to deploy ships of similar sizes on a route to provide uniform shipping services in each week, the ships in a string may not necessarily have the same capacity in terms of the number of TEU slots. For example, Maersk Line and MSC jointly operate an Asia-to-the-US West Coast service – Transpacific 2 (TP2) with the port rotation Kaohsiung, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Shanghai, Ningbo, Long Beach, and back to Kaohsiung again (Maersk, 2014). Six ships are deployed to provide a weekly service, see Table 1
                     
                      (Containership-Info, 2014; Schulte, 2014). We can see that only two ships (MSC RANIA and MSC HEIDI) are of the same size, and the difference between the capacities of two ships can be as large as 
                        
                           (
                           8530
                           −
                           6966
                           )
                           /
                           6966
                           ≈
                           22.5
                           
                           percent
                        
                     .

We identify the following two reasons that explain the ship size difference in a string: (i) Even if the string of ships was homogeneous, one of them may be under maintenance or repair, and hence another ship that may be different from the ones in the string has to come as a replacement. (ii) The rotation time of the route that the old string of ships needs to serve is changed, and new ships must be added to the string or some ships from the string have to serve other routes. For instance, when a string of mega-ships is delivered to replace an existing string on an Asia-Europe service, the latter string may be redeployed to an intra-Asia service due to the cascading effect (Cariou & Cheaitou, 2012). Some ships in the string will no long be needed as the intra-Asia service is shorter than the Asia-Europe one. A second example is service redesign due to business considerations, e.g., the pending expansion of the Panama Canal will enable post-Panama ships to visit the East Coast of the US from Asia via the Pacific Ocean (IAME, 2014). A third example is slow-steaming for saving bunker costs, which requires the insertion of one or two ships to an existing string (Fagerholt, Laporte, & Norstad, 2010).

This paper investigates how to determine the optimal sequence of ships in a string to minimize the expected number of delayed containers taking uncertain demand into consideration. We use the phrases “sequence of ships”, “string” and “permutation” interchangeably. The main challenge for the problem is that it is almost impossible to predict the probability distribution functions for the future demand (Zhen & Wang, 2015). In fact, even if we have the historical data on the demand, the data may be of limited value because the shipping environment changes rapidly. Therefore, a good string should be “robust” in that it is optimal or near-optimal for any random demand.

The literature on container ship deployment all focuses on the selection of the sizes of ship for each string (Christiansen, Fagerholt, Nygreen, & Ronen, 2013; Meng, Wang, Andersson, & Thun, 2014). Ships are grouped into several types, and ships of the same type are assumed to be homogeneous. For instance, the capacity of a particular type of ship might be considered as the average capacity of the ships of the type. As a result, the sequence of the ships in a string does not affect the shipping operations because they are assumed to be of the same size. For instance, Meng and Wang (2010) developed a chanced constrained ship fleet deployment model that ensured at least a certain proportion of the demand must be fulfilled; Ng (2014) presented a robust optimization model for determining the deployment of ships to hedge against the worst-case scenario of demand. Our study could be considered as a further refinement of ship deployment after the conventional step that categorizes ships into types.

The contribution of this paper is that (i) we address a practical research problem that is of significant importance for shipping lines; (ii) we develop a model for calculating the delay of containers given a sequence of ships, and derive bounds for the best and worst sequences; and (iii) we identify rules for choosing a good string that is optimal or near-optimal among all possible permutations, without requiring the probability distribution functions of the random demand. The chosen string by the rules is demonstrated to be near-optimal for very general distribution functions of the random demand based on extensive numerical experiments.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the problem of determining the sequence of ships in a string. Section 3 presents a model for calculating the delay of containers given a sequence of ships. Section 4 proposes rules for choosing a good string that is optimal or near-optimal among all possible permutations. Section 5 reports the results of extensive numerical experiments for assessing the efficacy of the rules. Section 6 concludes.

We consider the hit-haul leg of a long-haul liner service. The hit-haul leg is the leg on which the highest number of containers is carried. For instance, the leg after the last port of call in Asia in the hit-haul leg for trans-Pacific and Asia–Europe services, as the demand from Asia to the US/Europe is higher than that from the US/Europe to Asia. To simplify the exposition, we consider a liner service with only one export port (e.g., Shanghai) and one import port (e.g., Los Angeles), providing a weekly frequency, as most shipping services are weekly (Bell, Liu, Angeloudis, Fonzone, & Hosseinloo, 2011; Bell, Liu, Rioult, & Angeloudis, 2013; Wang, 2014; Wang & Meng, 2013).

A string of V ships are deployed on the service. The container capacity of ship v is denoted by Ev

                      TEUs are transported using the purchased slots. We call the containers transported using the purchased slots rejected containers. We assume that the penalty cost of a rejected TEU for the shipping line is equal to the delay cost of

                            based on subjective judgment. Note that the number of rejected containers is much smaller than the number of delayed containers. As a result, the value of c does not have a significant impact on the results, which is shown by the numerical results in Section 5.2.
                     . In sum, a container is either transported by a ship without delay, or transported using purchased slots, or delayed by one week and transported by the ship that arrives in the next week.

We focus on the average number of delayed and rejected containers over a sufficiently long time period. Hence, it does not matter how many containers are waiting at the export port at the beginning of the planning horizon. The problem is to determine the optimal sequence of the V ships in the string such that the average number of delayed and rejected containers (number of delayed ones plus c multiplied by the number of rejected ones) is minimal.

Since the string of ships forms a loop, it makes no difference which ship is defined as the first one. Therefore, for instance, the following five permutations are equivalent when

                     To avoid repetitive calculations, without loss of generality, we require that the first ship in the string is the one with the capacity E
                     1 (the smallest ship).

We have mentioned in Section 1 that it is almost impossible to predict the probability distribution functions for the future demand. In this section, we assume nonetheless that the container shipment demand in each week is independent and identically distributed, and the probability distribution function is known. We make this assumption because we can then calculate the exact number of delayed and rejected containers for a given permutation. The results will provide us with helpful insights for choosing a good string.

Suppose that the container shipment demand in each week is a random integer between 0 and N, and the probability that n TEUs are to be transported in a week is pn
                      ≥ 0,

Since all of the strings can be evaluated using the same approach, we consider the string in which ships are in the sequence of increasing sizes according to Eq. (1), i.e., 1 → 2 → 3 → ⋅⋅⋅ → V.

                     . If both V and Ev
                      are small, the equation system can be solved using software such as Matlab, and thereby the average number of delayed and rejected containers can be calculated by Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively. If it is too time-consuming to solve the equation system, we can use Monte Carlo simulation to directly estimate the average numbers of delayed and rejected containers.

                        Theorem 1 indicates the importance of considering ship heterogeneity in a string. Theorem 2 provides a lower bound on the cost of the optimal permutation for a given set of ships and for known probability distribution of demand. Theorem 3 demonstrates that the cost of a string can be extremely high despite its average capacity is higher than the average demand. Theorem 4 highlights that significant cost savings could be gained by carefully choosing the sequence of the ships. Therefore, we need to design a method for choosing the sequence of the ships.

As mentioned above, the demand distribution cannot be forecasted accurately. Moreover, the demand may change with time. Therefore, we have to identify a “robust” string that is capable of hedging against demand uncertainties. Fortunately, based on expert judgment and extensive tests, we identify three rules for finding such a string.

                        Choose a string that minimizes the absolute deviation of the sum of capacities of two consecutive ships, which is defined as

                     ), it is practical to enumerate all the possible permutations, and calculate A
                     1, A
                     2, and A
                     3 for each permutation to identify the one that satisfies Rule 3. For example, it can be seen that only the string 1 → 4 → 2 → 3 satisfies Rule 3 in Table 2. It happens that this string has the smallest number of delayed and rejected containers.

In extreme cases, it may not be possible to enumerate all of the permutations. For instance, 72 ships are deployed on the Daily Maersk service (DailyMaersk, 2014). Consequently, the number of permutations may be as large as 71! ≈ 8.5 × 10101. To identify the string that satisfies the three rules, we have to resort to mathematical programming methods.

The problem that minimizes A
                     1 is a symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP), in which each ship is a city to visit, the distances between city v and city v′ is

The two models [Model-Rule 2] and [Model-Rule 3] are different from formulations for the TSP because of the additional cuts (18) and (20)–(21). As a result, we may not be able to take advantage of the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving the TSP to solve the two models. To overcome this deficiency, we propose an exact TSP formulation for identifying a string that satisfies Rule 3 using the concept of the “big-M” method. Let M be a large positive number. Consider the asymmetric TSP in [Model-Rule 3]. Define the distance from city v to city v′ as

We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the string found by Rule 3 with

                         ships, whose capacities are integers uniformly distributed between 9,500 and 10,500 TEUs. We then generate the random demand based on some probability distributions, including uniform, normal, triangle, and lognormal distributions. As shown in Table 3
                        , we examine a total of 16 cases, where the column “Parameter” means the lower and upper bounds for uniform distributions; mean and variance for normal distributions; lower limit, peak location, and upper limits for triangular distribution; and mean and variance for lognormal distributions. Since the demand cannot be negative, in normal distributions we discard the realizations less than 0 or greater than two times the mean. Hence, the normal distributions are actually truncated normal distributions.

For each case, we randomly generate 20 instances. The ship sizes in all of the

                        We stress that in reality one does not know and cannot know which permutation is optimal before knowing the demand. Hence, the performance of the optimal permutation is a benchmark that cannot be achieved.

The results are shown in Table 3. The column “#Optimal” is the number of instances out of 20 such that the string that satisfies Rule 3 is also the optimal one. The columns “Average Gap” and “Largest Gap” report the average gap of the 20 instances and the largest one, respectively, defined by Eq. (23). It can be seen that the string satisfying Rule 3 is highly robust: it is optimal in 149 out of the total 320 instances; the average gap is not greater than 0.3 percent, and the largest gap is less than 2 percent.

The results in Table 4
                         reports the tests for seven ships under the same settings as the ones for six ships. Again, the string satisfying Rule 3 is highly robust: it is optimal in 73 out of the total 320 instances; the average gap is not greater than 0.4 percent, and the largest gap is less than 2 percent.

We further conducted 100 instances with eight randomly generated ships. The demand in a week has the same probability to follow uniform

We choose the value of c to be 5 simply based on subjective judgment. In this section, we analyze the sensitivity of the results with the value of c. We consider six ships with four different distributions of demand. For each distribution, 20 random instances are generated. For each instance, the value of c is varied from 3, 5, 7, to 10. The results are shown in Table 5
                        . It is clear that the value of c does not have a significant impact on the results. This is actually because the number of rejected containers is much smaller than the number of delayed containers. Hence, the solution obtained by the three rules is also robust with c.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have addressed the problem of how to determine the sequence of ships in a string to minimize the delay of containers, without requiring the probability distribution functions for the future demand. This is a practical research problem that is of significant importance for shipping lines. We have proposed three rules to identify an optimal or near-optimal string. The rules have been proved effective based on extensive numerical experiments. A rough estimation indicates that over 6 million dollars/year could be saved for all liner services in the world by optimizing the sequences of ships.

In this paper, the availability of the ships in the string is not incorporated (Wang, 2013). If the ships are newly delivered from shipyards, it is likely that they are not delivered at the same time. As a result, their sequence in the string cannot be arbitrarily determined. Therefore, one future research direction is to integrate the process of phasing-in and phasing-out of ships with the determination of their sequence in the string. Another possible research area is to examine how to determine the sequences of ships in several strings at the same time. This problem is more challenging because some ports are visited by more than one string and consequently the sequences of ships in different strings have to be coordinated.
