                  This paper is concerned with an algorithmic solution to the split common fixed point problem in Hilbert spaces. Our method can be regarded as a variant of the “viscosity approximation method”. Under very classical assumptions, we establish a strong convergence theorem with regard to involved operators belonging to the wide class of quasi-nonexpansive operators. In contrast with other related processes, our algorithm does not require any estimate of some spectral radius. The technique of analysis developed in this work is new and can be applied to many other fixed point iterations. Numerical experiments are also performed with regard to an inverse heat problem.

                      appears naturally when using subgradient projection operator techniques in solving convexly constrained problems (Yamada & Ogura, 2004; Yamada, Ogura, & Shirakawa, 2002; Yang & Zhao, 2006).

The above formalism provides an unified framework for the study of many significant real-world problems. It is worth underlining that (1.1) can be regarded as a generalization of the so-called split feasibility problem (introduced in Censor & Elfving (1994)):

Later on, further algorithmic solutions to (1.1), in general Hilbert spaces, were investigated for quasi-nonexpansive operators (even for more general demicontractive operators) through Mann-type variants of (1.3) (Moudafi, 2010, 2011). Only weak convergence results are established under a similar condition to (1.4) together with some classical demi-closedness property regarding the involved operators.

The demiclosedness property is well-known to be satisfied for instance by certain continuous operators such as nonexpansive and more general strictly pseudocontractive ones (Browder & Petryshyn, 1967; Marino & Xu, 2007), but also by (possibly discontinuous) operators, not nonexpansive, but quasi-nonexpansive (Maingé, 2008, Lemma 4.6).

Another approach to (1.1) was proposed in Byrne, Censor, Gibali, and Reich (2011) with regard to firmly nonexpansive operators S and T through the Halpern-type variant of algorithm (1.3) given by

To solve (1.1) relative to quasi-nonexpansive mappings S and T, Zhao and He have recently exploited a strategy similar to that used in Maingé (2010) (for the fixed point problem), by introducing relaxation parameters in their algorithm. More precisely, they proposed and studied the following “viscosity-like” iteration (see Zhao & He, 2012):

It turns out for convergence that all the above-mentioned fixed-point methods are based upon the knowledge of the spectral radius of the operator

More precisely, we prove a strong convergent result regarding a variant of (1.6), under very classical conditions, together with a range of variable step-sizes that does not depend on

                     . An important particular case of our less restrictive strategy is also considered, leading to Polyak-type algorithms (Polyak, 1987). Numerical experiments are also performed with regard to an inverse heat equation.
                        Remark 1.3
                        Let us emphasize that the techniques of analysis developed in this paper are different (regarding the asymptotic convergence part) from that of Zhao and He (2012). In particular, we implicitly extend the result of (at least) Maingé (2010) to the following wider and natural range of relaxation parameter

                           Our techniques of analysis can be also applied to algorithm (1.6) so as to extend its related strong convergence result to the range of parameter (1.8). However this is out of the scope of this paper and we pay attention to a slightly different method.

Let us recall (see Definition 1.1) that the class

                         of quasi-nonexpansive mappings includes the class

However, as can be noticed from the literature (related to (1.1)), the conditions on the parameters for convergence of algorithms such as (1.6) are somewhat different, when dealing either with element of

                        . So, in order to state precise results regarding these two situations, we will use the concept of demicontractive mappings (see, e.g., Hicks & Kubicek, 1977; Maingé & Maruster, 2011; Maruster, 1997; Moudafi, 2010).

                              ) and in Lions (1977) (also see Wittman, 1992). Afterwards, the convergence of (2.4) in its general form was discussed by Moudafi (2000) (also see Suzuki (2007) and Xu (2004)) for nonexpansive mappings and by Maingé (2010) for (relaxed) quasi-nonexpansive mappings (also see Kraikaew & Saejung, 2012; Wongchang & Saejung, 2011, for related works). This procedure can be regarded as a regularization process which is intended to induce the convergence in norm of the iterations. Another advantage of this procedure is that it allows a particular fixed point of T to be selected.

Clearly, condition (2.8) makes sense and it is more flexible than (2.5), in the sense that it provides a wider range of parameter for

Two consequences of Theorem 3.1 are also considered through Theorems 3.2 and 3.3.

Specifically, Theorem 3.2 is concerned with the particular choice of Polyak-type step-sizes, usually involved in projected subgradient methods (Polyak, 1987) (also see Larsson, Patricksson, & Stromberg (1996) for a performance study), namely

                        Let us recall that the fixed point set of any quasi-nonexpansive mapping is closed and convex (see, e.g., Yamada & Ogura, 2004, Proposition 1; Itoh & Takahashi, 1978, Corollary 1). It is then immediately deduced that 
                              
                                 Ω
                              
                            is a closed and convex subset of

                           Remark 5.1
                           Let us stress that the proof of convergence proposed in this paper is different from the usual ones (see, e.g., Lopez et al., 2012; Maingé, 2010; Zhao & He, 2012). Our approach does not distinguish between whether the sequence generated by the method is Fejer-monotone of not. Our new approach is simpler and more elegant. The same technique of analysis can be applied to the many papers dealing with viscosity-like algorithms and demicontractive mappings.

(A) Let us establish an a priori estimate on the iterations. From (2.3c), and setting

                     In this setting, (6.1) can be reformulated as a split common fixed point problem by means of subgradient projections and other appropriate types of operators.
                        Remark 6.1
                        Subgradient projection techniques occur for instance in signal and image processing as an alternative to projection methods (Bauschke & Combettes, 2001; Yamada & Ogura, 2004). Given a continuous convex function

In practice, the measurement of the data f is often corrupted by some noise, so that only a noisy data is available. Specifically we focus on the case of an uniformly distributed noise. Regarding this framework, Clason (2012) has recently discussed some regularization-like processes based on

                           Remark 7.4
                           Let us observe that the discrete model (7.5) can be enhanced (with regard to the desired purposes) when prior information regarding the exact solution U are known. For instance, if U is known to belong to some (explicitly given) convex and closed subset 
                                 
                                    ϒ
                                 
                               of

                              , then it seems natural to consider (instead of (7.5)) the following model:
