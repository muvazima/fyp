                  We used computational fluid dynamics to study the airflow characteristics in the ostiomeatal complex/middle turbinate of the human upper airway, where clinically relevant nasal polypoid changes occur (designated Regions A1–A4). We assessed six different flow rates representing one full period of respiration, based on realistic human respiration data, in an anatomically correct numerical model of a patient with a history of polypectomy.
                  The simulation results showed that Regions A1–A4 were not correlated with the local stagnation points where a locally high level of wall pressure was achieved. They, however, exhibited a very distinctive feature in that the positive wall-normal pressure gradients evaluated at the epithelial surface were persistent at six different flow rates spanning the whole respiration period in these areas. Therefore, the regions where polypoid changes developed were thought to be subject to mechanical irritation of the epithelium constantly via locally accelerating airflow moving towards the surface from the airway. On the contrary, relatively large or small values for local wall shear stress were not correlated with Regions A1–A4.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Nasal polyps (NPs) are commonly observed benign lesions arising from the mucosa of the nasal cavity, which affect up to 4% of the population [1–4]. They generally produce symptoms such as nasal obstruction, mucosal swelling, headache, and various infections, with the affected patients frequently complaining of watery rhinorrhea and postnasal drip [1–4]. Anosmia or hyposmia are other typical symptoms of polyps [3,5].

The etiology of NPs is not well known, although it has been linked to many clinical conditions such as chronic infection, drug sensitivity, epithelial disruption, epithelial cell defects, and alterations in the nasal aerodynamics due to the trapping of pollutants [2,3,6]. Recent clinical data indicate that the association of NPs with asthma is well recognized [2–4,7], while the role of allergies in the etiology and pathogenesis of NPs is still controversial [3,4,6,8–11]. Despite numerous studies on the pathogenesis of NPs, the initiating causes remain unknown, suggesting that various mechanisms might exist in different cases.

Many studies have provided comprehensive information regarding the sites of NP formation. Despite the presence of a relatively wide individual variation in the anatomy of the nasal cavity, the ostiomeatal complex (or anterior ethmoid complex [12]) is reported to be the most frequent site of NP formation [11,13–19]. In particular, Stammberger [13] observed that the rate of occurrence of NPs is over 80% in the regions of the uncinate process, middle turbinate, and infundibulum, which was later confirmed by Assanassen and Naclerio [14] and Andrews et al. [17]. Interestingly, Stammberger [13] noted that the areas at which NPs frequently originate are situated where the airstream first comes into contact with the mucosal surfaces, which might indicate that the presence of a nearby stagnation region resulting from the collision of the approaching airflow with the protruding surface of the epithelium is one of the discernable features of the regions of frequent NP formation.

The existence of regions with common high rates of NP formation, such as the uncinate process, middle turbinate, and infundibulum, observed by many independent groups of clinicians might suggest the conjecture that the local physiological characteristics strongly influenced by the anatomical geometry of these regions are better correlated with NP formation than the other intrinsic clinical conditions of an individual. Although the literature suggests that various local physiological factors trigger NP formation, it is important to assess the common features of local airflow in the regions with NPs that directly reflect the local geometric characteristics such as those described by Stammberger [13], in order to enhance our understanding of the possible role of airflow in NP formation.

The aim of the present numerical work was to examine the airflow characteristics in the regions where NPs occur, in order to investigate the presence of any distinctive canonical airflow features that might be considered as influencing the formation of NPs. In particular, the surface force exerted on the epithelium of the airway by local flow through the action of both wall pressure and wall shear stress was assessed. To achieve this, an anatomically correct numerical domain based on the computed tomography (CT) data of a male patient with a history of polypectomy was constructed to model the nasal cavity.

A computational model of the nasal cavity was created using 0.65-mm-thick CT images of a 45-year-old male patient who experienced recurrent NPs. The patient had a history of polypectomy for the surgical removal of an NP formed in the middle turbinate in December 2003. He underwent an endoscopic procedure and CT for the treatment of recurrent nasal obstruction in May 2013. At this time, the patient was found to be free of any NPs (
                        Fig. 1a). However, he was later diagnosed with several polypoid changes in the free margins of the uncinate process and middle turbinate and the anterior portion of the middle meatus in July 2013 (Fig. 1b), upon which the patient started receiving medical management. Note that the viewing angle and position of the endoscope are not the same for the two images taken at different times, shown in Fig. 1. In order to study the local flow characteristics in the region where polypoid changes had formed, a nasal cavity model was created using the CT data of the patient acquired in May 2013. The CT images were acquired at the Samsung Medical Center in Korea, and approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Samsung Medical Center.

Within the nasal cavity model created using the CT data obtained in May 2013 (
                        Fig. 2a), four different regions – Regions A1, A2, A3, and A4 – were selected corresponding to the locations where the nasal polypoid changes actually appeared in the later CT images acquired in July 2013. These regions were found to be located in the ostiomeatal complex, which is reported to be the most frequent site of NP formation [11,13–19]. The axial view of the CT image shown in Fig. 2b indicates that Regions A2–A4 had common geometric features in that the collision of the approaching airflow with the protruding surface of the epithelium occurred nearby, as noted by Stammberger [13]. On the other hand, Region A1 was located in the trough region of the lateral wall.

A series of steady computations were performed at several flow rates during both the inspiration and expiration periods in the human nasal cavity model shown in 
                        Fig. 3, in order to examine the air flow characteristics in the regions with NP formation. In order to reduce the computational costs, the main bodies of the various paranasal sinuses, including the maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses, were excluded in this nasal cavity model.

To achieve sufficiently accurate numerical results for the regions which had a relatively large velocity gradient, the grid-generating software ANSYS Meshing v14.5 (Pennsylvania, USA) was used to generate meshes with combined tetrahedral and prism elements (Fig. 3). As in our previous studies with similar geometry, seven layers of prism meshes were placed near the cavity surface [20,21]. The findings of the previous studies [20,21] had revealed that the use of approximately 4 million meshes is adequate for capturing the significant flow characteristics; we, therefore, assumed that computations conducted with approximately 4,008,000 mesh elements would be adequate to reveal the important flow characteristics within the scope of the present study. The justification for the use of a grid resolution of approximately 4,008,000 meshes for the present cavity model is included in Appendix A. The air chamber was placed outside the nostril, as in the study by Chung et al. [21], and the inlet boundary conditions with stagnation properties were specified at the surface of the air chamber.

For the purpose of reducing computational costs, we assumed that the real respiration process was reasonably represented by a series of steady solutions at the varying flow rates of 120, 250, and 450mL/s during both inspiration and expiration. These flow rates effectively represented a series of instants at 0.15, 0.25, 0.49, 1.09, 1.46, 1.57, 1.67, 1.72, 1.85, 2.03, 2.70, and 3.29s during one full respiration period of 4s, as shown in 
                        Fig. 4, which matched the human respiration data presented by Murray and Nadel [22] and constructed by Chung et al. [21]. Each flow rate was produced by applying an appropriate relative pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet of the numerical domain in order to mimic the natural respiration process, in a similar manner to that performed by Chung et al. [21].

The flow regime in the nasal cavity depends on specific airflow rates. Doorly et al. [23] observed turbulences in steady analyses at flow rates over 25L/min (≈417mL/s). Therefore, we decided that a SST k–ω model with a low Reynolds number correction (ANSYS-FLUENT v14.5) could be used to capture the turbulent flow regime for a flow rate of 450mL/s reasonably.

A no-slip velocity condition was specified for the surface of the cavity model. For simplicity, the effects of variations in temperature and humidity along the airway surface were not considered. The properties of the inhaled air were all evaluated at a constant temperature of 25°C throughout the simulation.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Stammberger [13] mentioned that in the majority of the cases, polyps originate in the contact areas of the middle meatus, particularly in the narrow clefts of the anterior ethmoid region, and they frequently originate in the areas where the airstream first encounters the mucosal surface. To elucidate the kinematic configuration of Regions A1–A4, the velocity field in the representative axial plane that cut through the region shown in Fig. 1a was examined at flow rates of 250 and 450mL/s during both inspiration and expiration periods (
                        Fig. 5). This plane was roughly parallel to the local airflow in this region.

Regions A2, A3, and A4 were located on the protruding mucosal surface, which has a convex curvature, whereas Region A1 was located on the lateral wall, which has a concave curvature. The velocity contours in the axial plane shown in Fig. 5a indicated that the airflow in the right nasal cavity divided into two different streams near Regions A3 and A4 during inspiration. As the flow rate increased from 250 to 450mL/s, the maximum velocity in this axial plane was also found to increase from 1.75 to 3.35m/s. A similar behavior of increase in the maximum velocity was also noted during expiration, as shown in Fig. 5b.

Since Region A1 was located in the trough of the lateral wall, a strong backflow of air was observed to occur in the region during the inspiration period, unlike in Regions A2–A4 (Fig. 5a). In particular, a fairly large backflow region, with a maximum negative velocity of −1.41m/s, was found to develop near Region A1 at a flow rate of 450mL/s during inspiration.

The physiological mechanism by which air flow affects edema and polyp formation has not been fully elucidated, but it is plausible that certain dynamic aspects of wall pressure and wall shear stress might be related to mucosal swelling, since they can readily cause mechanical irritation of the epithelium. Therefore, the wall pressure distribution, which is an essentially normal component of the force directly exerted on the epithelium, was examined at a flow rate of 450mL/s in Regions A1–A4 (
                        Fig. 6). The general qualitative features of the results obtained at a flow rate of 250mL/s were the same.

The existence of regions with locally high levels of wall pressure resulting from stagnation (represented by points S1, S2, and S3), where the airflow collides with the protruding mucosal surface during inspiration, thereby converting the kinetic energy into a pressure head, is demonstrated in Fig. 6a. However, it can be seen that Regions A2–A4 were not generally correlated with the stagnation areas even though they were located on the surfaces of the protruding structures. In addition, Region A1 also appeared to be not correlated with the regions showing locally elevated pressure during inspiration.

The variation of the wall pressure with time during the respiration period at several selected locations is shown in 
                        Fig. 7. The points P1, P2a, P2b, P3, P4a, and P4b represent Regions A1–A4, and points S1, S2, and S3 represent the local stagnation regions (Fig. 6). In addition, points N1 and N2 were also considered since they represented the locations with no polypoid changes. The results (Fig. 7) indicated that all of the points exhibited very similar variations with time, in phase with the variation of the pressure boundary conditions specified at the nasopharynx. During expiration, the variation of the wall pressure among the data points was significantly reduced. As stated earlier, the relatively high pressure observed at points S1–S2 during inspiration was a result of the phenomenon of stagnation.

In order to elucidate the quantity of air that is also possibly relevant to the mechanical irritation of the epithelium, the wall-normal component of the pressure gradient vector evaluated at the epithelial surface,

In fact, the use of the threshold values of 1 and 2Pa/m was found to yield very similar spatial distributions of the shaded areas. Region A1, which was not located on the surface of the protruding wall (unlike Regions A2–A4), was also shown to contain a shaded region.

The pressure gradient in the wall-normal direction evaluated over time at the wall at several representative points in Regions A1–A4 is shown in 
                        Fig. 12. Although all of the points maintained positive values during respiration, there were significant variations in the levels of the wall-normal pressure gradient depending on the location. The maximum values at points P2b, P3, and P4a during inspiration were found to be larger than those at points P1 and P2a.

Wall shear stress, as a tangential component of the force directly exerted on the epithelium, was also examined. 
                        Fig. 13 shows the distribution of the magnitude of the wall shear stress at a flow rate of 450mL/s. Much higher values of wall shear stress were realized near the stagnation regions during inspiration. However, the local extremes (i.e., maximum or minimum) of wall shear stress were not found to be well correlated with Regions A1–A4. Very complex variations of wall shear stress with time were also detected in Regions A1–A4, although the overall magnitudes of wall shear stress during inspiration varied according to the location (
                        Fig. 14).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In the present study, the local airflow characteristics in the regions where clinically relevant nasal polypoid changes occur (Regions A1–A4) were investigated. For this purpose, the CT data of a patient diagnosed with polypoid changes in the free margins of the uncinate process and middle turbinate and the anterior portion of the middle meatus were used to construct a nasal cavity model. This ostiomeatal complex is reported to be the most frequent site of NP formation [11,13–19]. Attention was paid to the behaviors of both wall pressure and wall shear stress fields, which could be the possible mechanisms of irritation exerted by airflow on the airway epithelium. While the etiology of NPs remains unknown [3,4,6,8–11], the present work attempted to identify any possible distinctive features of airflow that might be considered characteristic of the regions of NP formation.

Regions A2, A3, and A4 were located on the convex surface of the protruding structures, but were not found to be coincident with stagnation regions. Region A1 had different geometric characteristics from the rest in that it was located on the lateral wall and had a concave curvature; however, it was also found to be uncorrelated with the regions of locally high wall pressure. Therefore, the common flow characteristics of Regions A1–A4 could not be identified by only examining the absolute value of the wall pressure field. Interestingly, however, all four regions (A1, A2, A3, and A4) were found to exhibit very strong correlations with the regions of positive wall-normal pressure gradients maintained at the six different flow rates spanning one respiration period. Since the positive value of

                      implies that the air pressure in the vicinity of the wall is larger than the wall pressure, it gives rise to a locally high acceleration of the elementary air volume in the direction towards the wall. Thus, Regions A1–A4 appeared to be constantly subjected to mechanical stimulation by the air flowing towards the wall with increased inertia during respiration.

The function of wall pressure gradient as a possible mechanical factor can be observed in the study of blood flow. Giannoglou et al. [24] reported that low pressure gradients at the endothelial surface were associated with the locations of atherogenic lesions in their study on blood flow in the human left coronary artery tree. While their study suggests that negative wall pressure gradient could be an important physiological factor for blood flow Fig. 11 indicates that the positive normal pressure gradient at the wall is correlated with the nasal polyp formation. Different functions of the opposite sign of the wall pressure gradient observed in the study of Giannoglou et al. [24] and the present work may be attributed to the difference in the physiology in the blood flow through the coronary artery and in the airflow through the ostiomeatal complex but more case studies with polypoid changes would be required to further elucidate the role of positive normal pressure gradient.

Some of the locations inside Regions A1–A4 were subject to relatively higher or lower levels of wall shear stress during inspiration, as shown in Fig. 13. For example, the regions with relatively high wall shear stress were part of Regions A2 and P4, while a relatively low level of wall shear stress characterized Region A1 during respiration. Therefore, local extremes (i.e., very high or low levels) of wall shear stress are not likely to serve as common features characterizing Regions A1–A4.

The present results are based on the study of one individual, and by no means represent the general flow-pressure distribution in the ostiomeatal complex. In addition, one respiration period was assumed to be represented by a series of steady solutions obtained at six different flow rates (120, 250, and 450mL/s), as indicated in Fig. 4, and, therefore, the present results must be interpreted with caution. As stated earlier, the present study was not intended to elucidate the “cause and effect” relationship between the flow variables and NP formation; instead, we attempted to describe the common flow features of the regions where polypoid changes originate. Therefore, no attempt was made to assess the importance of the magnitude of the wall-normal component of the pressure gradient, since it would have required extensive data from multiple patients with polypoid changes. In order to establish any concrete correlation between the flow variables and the formation of polyps, more rigorous future studies of the possible role of airflow through the upper airway assessing the existence of a mechanism that could cause chronic irritation of the nasal cavity epithelium are required.

The authors declare that there are no potential conflicts of interest including any financial, personal, or other relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence this work.

In order to establish grid independence for the numerical results presented in this study, we conducted additional computations with 1,040,000; 2,063,000; and 7,834,000 mesh elements at a flow rate of 250mL/s. As previously shown by Chung et al. [21], the prism mesh elements placed near the surface were combined with the tetrahedral ones placed in the central part of the air passage. Two representative monitoring points were selected to check the effect of resolution on the velocity field. One of the monitoring points was located in the ostiomeatal complex and the other in the inferior meatus. 
                        Table 1 summarizes the variations of both velocity and pressure with the number of mesh elements at the two locations. The changes in velocity and pressure were found to be significantly decreased at Point 1 when the number of mesh elements changed from 4,008,000 to 7,834,000. Similar results were noted at Point 2. This suggests that the changes in both velocity and pressure are considerably smaller when more than 4 million mesh elements are used. Therefore, within the scope of the present work, all of the results presented in this study were obtained from computations using 4,008,000 meshes.
