                  This study addresses the optimal pipe-sizing problem of a tree-shaped gas distribution network with a single supply source. An algorithm was developed with the aim of minimizing the investment for constructing a gas distribution network with a tree-shaped layout in which demands are fixed.
                  The construction cost is known to depend on the pipe diameters used for each arc in the network. However, under the assumption that pipe diameters are continuous, we prove that it is possible to obtain the minimum construction cost directly and analytically by an iterating procedure that converts the original tree into a single equivalent arc. In addition, we also show that expanding the converted single arc inversely to the original tree computes the optimal continuous pipe diameter for each arc. Following this, we present an additional heuristic to convert optimal continuous pipe diameters into approximate discrete pipe diameters.
                  The algorithms were evaluated by applying them to sample networks. The numerical results obtained by comparing the approximate discrete diameters with the optimal discrete diameters confirm the efficiency of our algorithms, thereby demonstrating their suitability for designing real gas distribution networks.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Gas distribution network systems are widely used in major cities around the world. City gas systems in Japan currently consist of 246,147 kilometer (The Japan Gas Association, 2013) of pipes with a thickness of at least 50 millimeter to supply not only wholesale, but also retail customers, such as industrial, commercial, and residential consumers.

The construction of a new distribution network is usually preceded by a process consisting of several phases; for example, De Corte and Sörensen (2013) identified four different phases for new water systems:

                        
                           1.
                           Layout phase: define the structure of the network.

Design phase: choose the type (diameter and material) of each pipe.

Programming phase: set up a priority order for consumers.

Planning phase: decide a daily operation.

As gas supply systems have similar characteristics to water supply systems, these four phases would be equally applicable to gas supply systems.

Based on the above process, the first phase of our optimization would require us to decide whether to use the layout shown in Fig. 1.1 or that in Fig. 1.2 when supplying gas from source node 1 to demand nodes 2--7. After deciding the layout, we would need to choose the pipe sizes in the design phase. This would require us to keep the following facts in mind. The gas pressure supplied at the source node drops as the distance to the demand nodes increases, because of the friction with the walls of the pipes. Furthermore, a reduction in the diameter of the pipes leads to a rapid decrease in pressure. Every gas utility has a duty to supply gas within a predetermined pressure range at each demand node. If gas utilities select pipes with larger diameters, they would be able to increase the pressure at each demand node, but this would increase the construction cost. Therefore, in the design phase, it would be necessary to select commercial pipe sizes such that the construction cost of the network is minimized, while ensuring that the required pressure bound is satisfied at each demand node. In this study, we refer to this problem as the optimal pipe-sizing problem of distribution networks (OPi).
                     
                  

The problem OPi has been studied for over forty years, and during this time three types of diameters have been considered: (i) the discrete diameter, where a pipe consists of one commercially available diameter, (ii) the split-pipe diameter, where a pipe consists of different commercially available diameter segments that are serially connected, and (iii) the continuous diameter, where a pipe diameter is continuous. Note that the formulation of OPi is almost the same for gas and water distribution systems (Hansen, Madsen, & Nielsen, 1991). Earlier studies mostly assumed the split-pipe and continuous diameter types, for which a number of techniques were proposed by De Wolf and Smeers (1996), Hansen et al. (1991), Osiadacz and Gorecki (1995), and Wu, Lai, and Liu (2007) for gas supply systems, whereas reviews of previous studies of water supply systems were presented by Bhave (2003) and Mays (1989). In contrast, the problem of sizing with discrete diameters has mainly been addressed using meta-heuristic techniques. The interested reader is referred to De Corte and Sörensen (2013), Haghighi, Samani, and Samani (2011), Mora-Melia, Iglesias-Rey, Martinez-Solano, and Fuertes-Miquel (2013), and Sheikholeslami, Kaveh, Tahershamsi, and Talatahari (2014) for water supply systems. André, Bonnans, and Cornibert (2009) applied a branch and bound scheme to obtain the discrete diameters after they solved a continuous relaxation of the problem for gas transportation networks. In addition, Bragalli, D'Ambrosio, Lee, Lodi, and Toth (2012) applied the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and nonlinear programming approach and Raghunathan (2013) applied a linearization-based approach for the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem after they showed that OPi for a discrete diameter was an MINLP problem. Note that OPi for the discrete diameter is NP-hard (Yates, Templeman, & Boffey, 1984). These studies were mainly devoted to solving networks that contain cycles, such as the network depicted in Fig. 1.1.
                  

On the other hand, in this paper, we focus on tree-shaped networks, such as that shown in Fig. 1.2. In general, layouts such as that shown in Fig. 1.2 are superior to that shown in Fig. 1.1 from the viewpoint of the construction cost. Bhaskaran and Salzborn (1979) actually proved that a cost-minimized layout requires a tree where the pipe diameter is continuous and the construction cost is proportional to the γ( < 8/3)-th power of the diameter. In reality, gas utilities design networks of this type (Ebrahimi, 2010 and Mohajeri, Mahdavi, Mahdavi-Amiri, & Tafazzoli, 2011). When Japanese gas utilities design a new medium-pressure gas distribution network (from 0.1 to 1 megapascal), the layout tends to be tree-shaped as customers are geographically dispersed. In addition, determining the layout and the pipe diameters for a network containing cycles, some researchers (Afshar, 2007, André et al., 2013, Bhave, 2003, Rothfarb, Frank, Rosenbaum, Steiglitz, & Kleitman, 1970, and Saleh & Tanyimboh, 2013) proposed a technique enumerating all spanning trees, including the source node and all the demand nodes, and computing a construction cost for each tree. Note that OPi for a tree-shaped network becomes an integer programming (IP) problem for the discrete diameter because the flow rate is computed for each pipe of a tree a priori, but it is still NP-hard (Yates et al., 1984). Therefore, it is necessary to develop an efficient method that determines optimal pipe sizing for a tree-shaped layout in short computational time and with high accuracy.

Tree-shaped networks have previously been studied. One of these studies was conducted by Mohajeri et al. (2011), who applied the ant colony optimization to a discrete diameter pipe. Assuming the split-pipe diameter, Karmeli, Gadish, and Meyers (1968) showed that linear programming can be employed to determine a global optimal solution. Furthermore, assuming the continuous diameter, Deb (1974) showed that the problem can be expressed as a set of nonlinear simultaneous equations, whereas Fujiwara and Dey (1988) developed the Lagrange multiplier method in which each Lagrange multiplier can be obtained by using only arithmetic operations.

In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms to solve the optimal pipe-sizing problem for the discrete diameter where the problem is given by a tree consisting of a single source node and a number of demand nodes. At first, under the assumption of continuous pipes, we directly calculate the minimum construction cost by iterating the contraction of the tree. We also present a computational algorithm to obtain the optimal continuous pipe diameter for each arc and the optimal pressure at each node by iterating the expansion to the original tree. Following this, we introduce a heuristic where we use the optimal continuous diameter to assign a discrete diameter for each pipe. Our solution methods do not require mathematical programming software and find optimal continuous diameters without computing Lagrange multipliers as in Fujiwara and Dey (1988).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly states the optimal pipe-sizing problem for tree-shaped gas networks. Section 3 introduces the algorithm that obtains the minimum cost and optimal continuous diameters analytically where the diameters are continuous, and the heuristic that assigns the approximate discrete diameters. Our solution methods are applied to two sample networks to compare the optimal and approximate discrete diameters in terms of accuracy and computation time in Section 4. In the final section, we present a conclusion.

Consider a situation, in the above-mentioned design phase, where a gas utility constructs a new distribution network to supply a number of customers from a single supply facility. The network is given by a tree-shaped layout, in which the customers and gas facility are represented by nodes and the pipes by arcs linking the nodes. The gas utility now wishes to select the commercial pipe diameter to minimize the construction cost, on the one hand, and by ensuring the required pressure bound for each customer, on the other.

Let r ∈ N(T) be the single source node, which forms the root of the tree. Let δi
                      be the demand corresponding to node i ∈ N(T)/{r}. δi
                      is a non-negative constant and clearly δi
                      > 0 for demand nodes and

Each arc (i, j) ∈ A(T) is characterized by the flow rate qij
                     , diameter dij
                     , and pipe length lij
                      from node i to j. Directed arcs indicate the flow direction. Let Δj
                      denote the set of nodes consisting of j and its descendants. As a network is a tree, qij
                      is a positive constant that can be computed as

                      is a positive constant and dij
                      is a decision variable.

The pressure for each node is assumed as follows:

                        
                           (a)
                           The pressure at the source node r is p
                              max.

The pressure pi
                               for i ∈ N(T)/{r} is not less than p
                              min.

Here, p
                     max is either described in the terms and conditions of each local gas utility or decided as the physical upper bound of the pipes and p
                     min (p
                     min < p
                     max) is described in the terms and conditions. Gas utilities are duty-bound to supply gas within the range p

There exist three decision variables in (1), dij, pi
                     , and pj
                     , but we can eliminate pi
                      and pj
                      by combining assumptions (a)–(c). Let V⊆N(T) be the set of leaves of T and Prv
                      the r-v-path from r to v ∈ V. For a tree-shaped network the r-v-path is unique. The supplied pressure p
                     max at r gradually decreases along the r-v-path, which means that the pressure at v is more than or equal to p
                     min as a result. Therefore, as an alternative way of stating (a)-(c) is that a decrease in the pressure drop from r to v ∈ V does not exceed

Finally, we discuss the construction cost per unit length for (i, j) ∈ A(T), for which there are two models, (i)

André et al. (2009) states (i) is the most used for natural gas pipelines (see De Wolf & Smeers, 1996 and Parker, 2005), but we believe that these are mainly applied to gas transmission networks (above 1 megapascal). With regard to gas distribution networks, Boyne (1972) assumes (ii) with

As our network is a medium-pressure gas distribution network, we chose (ii) for this study. Note that if the cost function is linear (Castello, Tzimas, Moretto, & Peteves, 2005),

                      is a constant for a tree-shaped network. Therefore, when formulating the problem OPi, we can eliminate lijeij
                     , as the optimal diameter does not depend on it.

We now present OPi for a given tree T. Under the assumption that dij
                      is the discrete diameter, we can formulate the IP problem with a decision variable dij
                      that is selected from a range of commercial diameters

In this section, we present the procedure to obtain the minimum cost and optimal continuous diameters for OPiC shown in (6)–(8). An iterating procedure that contracts a tree converts the original tree into a single equivalent arc, thereby facilitating the computation of the minimum cost. In addition, we introduce an inverse procedure to compute the optimal continuous diameter for each arc of the original tree and present an algorithm to convert this optimal continuous diameter into an approximate discrete diameter as the solution of OPiD shown in (3)–(5).

In this study, we refer to the problem (11)–(13) as the optimal pressure problem of a gas distribution network for the continuous diameter (OPrC). Clearly, the minimum costs of OPiC and OPrC are equivalent.

With regard to OPrC, we prove Lemma 1 and 2.

Q.E.D.

Note that the cost increases with increasing diameter according to (6). Therefore, it is obvious that the minimum possible diameter must be chosen and thus the upper bound on the pressure drop constraint (7) must be active.

In this section, we show the contraction and expansion procedure for a given tree. As the procedure differs according to the type of tree, two types of tree, A and B, are presented.

                        1 into T
                        2  as an example of type A shown in Fig. 3.1 is referred to as “Contraction procedures A.” Then, the following lemma is established between T
                        1 and T
                        2.

                        1 is inversely created by expanding T
                        2. We refer to these procedures as Expansion procedures A.

For example, for a path graph, i.e., a graph in which none of the nodes has more than one child, as shown in Fig. 3.2, the minimum cost and the pressure drops can easily be obtained by iterating Contraction procedures A and Expansion procedures A, respectively.

(2) Contraction and expansion for a “type B” tree
                     

In this study, a tree is referred to as “type B” if there is at least one parent with two or more children as its leaves. In addition, a procedure involving the aggregation of the children of u to transform T
                        3 into T
                        4 as an example of type B shown in Fig. 3.3 is referred to as “Contraction procedures B.” Then, the following lemma is established between T
                        3 and T
                        4.

This implies that T
                        3 is inversely created by expanding T
                        4. These procedures are referred to as Expansion procedures B.

For example, for a star graph, i.e., the tree shown in Fig. 3.4
                        , in which all the demand nodes are children of the source node, the minimum cost and the optimal pressure drop can be obtained by using Contraction procedures B and Expansion procedures B for only one iteration, respectively.

In this section, we show that the minimum cost φ
                           C
                        * can easily be obtained, because iterating both Contraction procedures A and B converts an original tree into a single arc connecting the root to a single node. When arcs are contracted by applying Contraction procedures A or B, the weight of every arc in the contracted tree can be expressed by a formula of weights in the original tree. In addition, a pressure drop for every arc in the original tree can be expressed by a formula of a pressure drop in the contracted tree. Hence, we state Theorem 1.

                              1) is defined as a parent of v.

In this study, we establish the following heuristic to allocate the optimal continuous diameter to the feasible discrete diameter for each arc. In this study, we assume 
                           
                              
                                 d
                                 
                                    i
                                    j
                                 
                                 
                                    C
                                    *
                                 
                              
                              ≤
                              
                                 d
                                 m
                              
                           
                        , because dm
                         is sufficiently large in reality. At first, we assign the initial discrete diameter by rounding down the continuous diameter 
                           
                              d
                              
                                 i
                                 j
                              
                              
                                 C
                                 *
                              
                           
                        . Thereafter, we increase the discrete diameter in the ascending order of a specified index for each arc (i, j) ∈ A(T) until the pressure is at least p
                        min for every leaf. The index is the difference between the γ-th powers of the discrete diameter obtained by rounding up 
                           
                              d
                              
                                 i
                                 j
                              
                              
                                 C
                                 *
                              
                           
                         and the γ-th powers of 
                           
                              d
                              
                                 i
                                 j
                              
                              
                                 C
                                 *
                              
                           
                        . However, this procedure may select an unnecessary arc for a diameter increase. For example, if every leaf in all paths including a selected arc has already exceeded p
                        min, we need not increase the diameter for this arc. Then, we seek the possibility of a diameter reduction for every arc whose diameter has been increased. As this algorithm does not guarantee the global optimal solution, let

                        . In addition, we install τij
                         to enable us to store an index of discrete diameters 
                           
                              (

                                 1

                                 ,
                                 …
                                 ,
                                 m

                         chosen for (i, j) ∈ A(T).
                     

We then show the approximation discrete diameter algorithm in Algorithm 2. Note that we assign the smallest discrete diameter d
                        1 for (i, j) if

                         is smaller than d
                        1 as an initial value in Step 1.1 and we decide the order in which the diameter of the arcs are increased by ρij
                         in Step 2. Steps 3.1 and 3.2 of this algorithm increment the discrete diameter. Note that a feasible solution is always obtained by Step 3 because the discrete diameter is not less than the continuous diameter for every arc when every (i, j) ∈ A(T) satisfying τij
                         < m is selected in Step 3. In Step 4, we examine whether it would be possible to reduce the diameter of every arc whose diameter was increased in Step 3. We decrease the diameter for an arc at first. Then, if the pressure for at least one node drops below p
                        min, the diameter of the arc is restored to its original size before the reduction. By these steps, the approximate discrete diameter for each arc is obtained in Step 5.

In the next section, we evaluate our proposed combination of algorithms. As mentioned in Section 2, our problem, OPiD for a tree-shaped network, is an IP problem. When Raghunathan (2013) solved OPiD with cycles formulated as an MINLP problem, they found the global optimal solution using IBM-ILOG-CPLEX as MILP solver by iteratively linearizing the problem to an MILP problem in a reasonable computation time. Bragalli et al. (2012) also employed IBM-ILOG-CPLEX as an MILP solver to solve OPiD with cycles. Thus, we used their results as a benchmark with which to compare the performance of our algorithms by running the IP solver Gurobi 5.6.2. to show that our algorithms are capable of performing the approximation with high accuracy and in a much shorter computation time.

In this section, both our algorithms (Algorithms 1 and 2) are used in combination for the evaluation of two sample networks in practice.

We now present the first sample network, which was obtained by modifying data from the real network shown in Fig. 4.1. In Fig. 4.1 (a), there exists a supply node (1), demand nodes (

The layout T consists of 19 arcs and 20 nodes. Each arc is labeled

                        min=0.3 (megapascal) as an upper medium pressure network. In addition, we assign the commercial diameters dτ

As mentioned in Section 1, for the solution of OPiD in a network with cycles, several researchers have suggested enumerating all spanning trees in the network, which requires a time-efficient algorithm for tree-shaped networks. Combined with this enumeration technique our results indicate that our algorithm is well suited to provide an approximate solution for the OPiD that includes cycles.

Fig. 4.2 shows the length (kilometer) of each arc (underlined) and the specified consumption (cubic meters per hour) for each demand node in parentheses.

                         was performed by writing code by using Python2.7a, whereas Gurobi 5.6.2 was used to obtain φ

The results are shown in Table 4.5
                         and in Figs. 4.3
                         and Fig. 4.4
                        . The computation time is nearly identical for different values of γ. In addition, regardless of the value of γ, the difference between

                           D

                         was much shorter than that required for φ
                           D
                        *. Therefore, this demonstrates that our algorithms are capable of finding the discrete diameter with high accuracy in very short computation time for a large gas network.

this paper presents the development of the tree contraction–expansion algorithm for the problem OPiC. It iterates the contraction of a tree to compute the minimum cost analytically; further, it iterates the expansion from the contracted tree to the original tree to compute the optimal diameter for each arc where the diameter is a continuous variable. An algorithm for converting the optimal continuous diameters to the approximate discrete diameters as solutions of OPiD was also developed.

The efficiency of our proposed algorithms was demonstrated for two sample networks, for which the parameters were computed with high accuracy in a short computation time. It should therefore be possible to use our algorithms to design a gas distribution network in practice.
