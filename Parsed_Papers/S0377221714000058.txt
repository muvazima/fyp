                  In this paper we discuss the multicriteria p-facility median location problem on networks with positive and negative weights. We assume that the demand is located at the nodes and can be different for each criterion under consideration. The goal is to obtain the set of Pareto-optimal locations in the graph and the corresponding set of non-dominated objective values. To that end, we first characterize the linearity domains of the distance functions on the graph and compute the image of each linearity domain in the objective space. The lower envelope of a transformation of all these images then gives us the set of all non-dominated points in the objective space and its preimage corresponds to the set of all Pareto-optimal solutions on the graph. For the bicriteria 2-facility case we present a low order polynomial time algorithm. Also for the general case we propose an efficient algorithm, which is polynomial if the number of facilities and criteria is fixed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many real-world applications are concerned with finding an optimal location for one or more new facilities on a network (road network, power grid, etc.) minimizing a function of the distances between these facilities and a given set of existing facilities (clients, demand points), where the latter typically coincide with vertices. For a recent book on location theory the reader is referred to Nickel and Puerto (2005) and references therein. Since the first seminal paper by Hakimi (1964), an ever growing number of results have been published in this field.

The majority of research focuses on the minimization of a single objective function that is increasing with distance. However, in the process of locating a new facility usually more than one decision maker is involved. This is due to the fact that often the cost incurred with the decision is relatively high. Furthermore, different decision makers may (or will) have different (conflicting) objectives. In other situations, different scenarios must be compared due to uncertainty of data or still undecided parameters of the model. One way to deal with these situations is to apply scenario analysis. Another way of reflecting uncertainty in the parameters is to consider different replications of the objective function. Hence, there exists a large number of real-world problems which can only be modeled suitably through a multicriteria approach, especially when locating public facilities.

An additional difficulty is that we are usually dealing with conflicting criteria and a single optimal solution does not always exist (which would be an optimal solution for each of the criteria). Therefore, an alternative solution concept has to be used. One possibility is to determine the set of non-dominated solutions. That is, solutions such that there exists no other solution which is at least as good for all decision makers and strictly better for at least one of them. These solutions are often called Pareto-optimal. For an overview on multicriteria location problems the reader is referred to Nickel, Puerto, and Rodríguez-Chía (2005).

In contrast to the practical needs described above, network location research involving multiple criteria has received little attention, especially when it comes to multiple facilities. In this paper, we consider the p-facility median location problem with several objective functions. Hereby, each objective function is representing the goal of one decision maker and the aim is to locate p facilities in order to minimize the total weighted distance from the clients to their closest facility. The weights assigned to clients vary from one decision maker to another, yielding different objective functions. It might even happen that one of the facilities is desirable for some decision makers and, at the same time, undesirable for others. Undesirable facilities are usually modeled using negative weights. See Eiselt and Laporte (1995) for more details on these problems. Before we discuss the literature, we present a practical example for this model. Suppose we want to locate two garbage dumps and we have a set of residential and recreational areas and a set of industrial sites where garbage has to be collected. There are two decision makers involved: the “Business economist” who has to keep the costs in check and the “Politician” who is concerned about the nuisance of the garbage dumps and the garbage trucks on the population. The business economist wants the dumps to be close to all sites to minimize travel times and costs. To that end he associates positive weights with the residential and industrial areas that are proportional to the average number of required garbage collections. In contrast to that, the politician wants to minimize the nuisance of the garbage dumps and of the trucks frequenting the garbage dumps for the population. Therefore, he assigns to each site a second, negative value. The smaller the weight is, the more likely it is that the residential area is far away from the dumps and the less likely it is that trucks that are not bound for these areas are simply passing through them on their way to the dumps. Formulating this problem in mathematical terms results in a bi-criteria 2-facility location model.

There are many other applications of multicriteria multifacility location problems. Bitran and Lawrence (1980) consider the multicriteria location of regional service offices in the expanding operating territories of a large property and liability insurer. These offices serve as first line administrative centers for sales support and claims processing. Another application of multiobjective optimization in the context of location theory can be found in Johnson (2001) that discusses a spatial decision making problem for housing mobility planning. Ehrgott and Rau (1999) present an analysis of a part of the distribution system of BASF SE, which involves the construction of warehouses at various locations. The authors evaluate 14 different scenarios and each of these scenarios is evaluated with the minimal cost solution obtained through linear programming and the resulting average delivery time at this particular solution. For more applications see Schöbel (2005), Carrano, Takahashi, Finseca, and Neto (2007), and Kolokolov and Zaozerskaya (2013).

Concerning the methodological aspects of multicriteria network location problems, Hamacher, Labbé, and Nickel (1999) discuss the network 1-facility problem with median objective functions. They show that for Pareto-optimal locations on undirected networks no node dominance result can be proven. Hamacher, Labbé, Nickel, and Skriver (2002) provide a polynomial time algorithm for the 1-facility problem when the objectives are both weighted median and anti-median functions. The method is generalized for any piecewise linear objective function. Zhang and Melachrinoudis (2001) develop a polynomial algorithm for the 2-criteria 1-facility network location problem maximizing the minimum weighted distance from the service facility to the nodes (maximin) and maximizing the sum of weighted distances between the service facility and the nodes (maxisum). Skriver, Andersen, and Holmberg (2004) introduce two sum objectives and criteria dependent edge lengths for the 1-facility 2-criteria problem. Nickel and Puerto (2005) solve the 1-facility problem when all objective functions are ordered medians. Colebrook and Sicilia (2007a, 2007b) provide polynomial algorithms for solving the cent-dian 1-facility location problem on networks with criteria dependent edge lengths and facilities being attractive or obnoxious.

Concerning the single criterion multifacility location problem on networks, Kalcsics (2011) derives a finite domination set for the p-median problem with positive and negative weights. For the 2-facility case, the author presents an efficient solution procedure using planar arrangements. Based on this approach, Kalcsics, Nickel, Puerto, and Rodríguez-Chía (2012) solve the 2-facility case for different equity measures.

Many of the previous papers study the problem on trees as a particular case of generalized networks. The first work dealing with several objectives and facilities is provided by Tansel, Francis, and Lowe (1982) who develop an algorithm for finding the efficient frontier of the biobjective multifacility minimax location problem on a tree network. This problem involves as objective functions the maximum of the weighted distances between specified pairs of new and existing facilities.

Despite its intrinsic interest as discussed above, to the best of our knowledge there are no papers discussing the multicriteria p-facility median location problem on networks and no results are known until the moment to obtain the set of Pareto-optimal solutions.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the notation and concepts used throughout the paper. Section 3 presents some properties of the k-criteria p-facility median problem on networks. Section 4 is devoted to the development of a polynomial algorithm for the 2-criteria 2-facility version of the problem. A solution procedure for the general case is proposed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 contains some conclusions and possible extensions of the analyzed problems.

                         the set of all Pareto-optimal solutions of (1). As mentioned in the introduction, we are interested in obtaining a description of the complete sets of Pareto-optimal solutions (in the decision space) and the non-dominated points (in the objective space). Hereby, the set of Pareto-optimal solutions comprises all alternative location vectors for the p facilities that are suitable candidates to choose from, because no other point can give rise to objective values that dominate them component-wise.

To that end, using the subdivision introduced in the previous section for a given p-tuple h of edges, it will be necessary to compute in a first step the images of all cells of this subdivision. Given these images for all p-tuples h, we are then able to derive the set of non-dominated points. In a last step, we have to identify the set of location vectors on the graph whose image corresponds to the non-dominated points. These location vectors then comprise the set of Pareto-optimal solutions of our problem. In this section we discus how to compute images of cells and preimages of sets of points in the objective space. Moreover, we present some properties of the objective function of the

                      of the images of all cells in the objective space, we adapt the approach in Hamacher et al. (1999) for the single facility bi-criteria problem. The idea of their approach is to determine the set of non-dominated points in the objective space by means of the lower envelope. To facilitate that approach, they add to the rightmost point of each image a right-open horizontal halfline (as 
                        
                           p
                           =
                           1
                        
                     , all images are points or segments). Then, each point in the objective space that is not on the lower envelope will obviously be dominated by a point on the envelope. At the end, they delete all parts of the lower envelope that belong to horizontal halflines that have been added before. The remaining points then comprise the set of all non-dominated points. Coming back to our problem, to compute the set of all non-dominated points in the objective space, we compute the image

                     ). If the image is a point or a segment, we add it to a set 
                        
                           L
                        
                      together with a reference to the respective cell. If 
                        
                           F
                           (

                      is a polygon, all interior points will be dominated by points on the boundary. Thus, we only add the bounding edges of the polygon to 
                        
                           L
                        
                     , again with a reference to the respective cell. Note that each polygon has at most eight bounding edges (Kalcsics, 2011). In view of the general case to be discussed in Section 5, we generalize the approach in Hamacher et al. (1999) as follows. We add to the bottommost point of each image a horizontal and a vertical halfline extending to 
                        
                           +
                           ∞
                        
                     . Then, we first determine the lower envelope in y-direction and afterwards the lower envelope of the remaining points in x-direction. In this way, all dominated points will be eliminated. Formally, let

As for the computation of preimages of elements in the set of non-dominated points, Step 8 can be done in constant time since it is part of the output of the lower envelope algorithm. Step 10 can be carried out in constant time since the preimage of a point or segment has at most eight bounding segments. Thus, the overall complexity of Steps 7–10 is equal to the number of components of

In this section we show how to extend the previous results in order to derive an algorithmic approach to solve the general problem with p facilities and k criteria, i.e., the 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           p
                           )
                        
                     -MLPN. Note first that the 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           p
                           )
                        
                     -MLPN is NP-hard (if p is part of the input) because it generalizes the (1,p)-MLPN (Hakimi, 1965). Thus, there does not exist a polynomial algorithm to solve the 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           p
                           )
                        
                     -MLPN (unless 
                        
                           P

                     ).

The outline of the approach for the general case is the same as for

In this paper we have provided a methodology to obtain a complete description of the set of Pareto-optimal solutions for the multicriteria p-facility median location problem on networks. It is noteworthy that this paper is the first attempt to characterize the solution set of this problem. Note that the single criteria p-facility median problem is already NP-hard and handling closest assignments makes more difficult to deal with the multifacility version.

The main tools used to obtain the set of Pareto-optimal solutions is the characterization of the linearity domains of the distance functions and the lower envelope. Hence, this analysis can be easily extended to more general objective functions as long as we can again determine these domains and their image and preimage. In this sense, an open line of research is to obtain the characterization of Pareto-optimal solutions for the case of ordered median objective functions. Recall that this function includes as particular instances most classical objectives functions used in Location Theory, as for instance the median, center, k-center and cent-dian, see Nickel and Puerto (2005) for further details.
