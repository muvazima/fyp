                     . First, any C-Bézier curve is divided into a Bézier curve and a trigonometric part. So any C-Bézier curve describes the trajectory of a point orbiting around a center in an elliptical orbit while the orbital plane is moving as the ellipse center translating along a Bézier curve. Second, the geometric characters of the C-Bézier curve (the control points of the center Bézier curve, the trajectories of the vertices and the foci of the ellipse, etc.), can all be explicitly presented by the control points of the C-Bézier curve. Third, considering some special cases, we give the sufficient and necessary conditions of C-Bézier basis forming Bézier curve, ellipse, circle, common helix, and so on. Lastly, we show how to build some geometrically intuitive curves through the C-Bézier basis without rational forms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Bézier-like models, defined over some non-algebraic polynomial spaces, may be used as alternatives of the rational Bézier model  [1]. They include the 
                        p
                     -Bézier  [2], the quasi Bézier  [3], the C-Bézier  [4,5], the AH-Bézier  [6], the AHT-Bézier  [7], the Bézier-like models using complex numbers  [8–10], and so on.

These Bézier-like models can build some classical curves without rational forms; for example, C-Bézier for ellipse, and AH-Bézier for hyperbola. Then what about the general cases? This paper considers an arbitrary C-Bézier curve over

We focus on the geometric shape of the C-Bézier curve (1). Previous studies indicate that any rational quadratic Bézier curve is a conic  [11]. Its geometric characters (vertices, eccentricity, etc.) can be explicitly expressed by the control points and weighs [12,13].

For the first question,  [14] gives the answer to planar curves under the condition 
                        n
                        =
                        1
                     . In this paper, we consider more general cases, both planar and space curves, for any positive integer 
                        n
                     . We explain what the C-Bézier curve is from a geometric view. This helps the intuitive construction of some classical curves.

                         are obtained by Theorem 2.2. Its blue thinner C-Bézier curve is the same as the thicker magenta separated-form curve. This means that our transformation formulas are all correct.

This section focuses on the geometric shapes of C-Bézier curves. We first consider the general cases, and then some special cases.

From the last section, any C-Bézier curve (1) can be represented as the separated form (2). So in the general cases, any point 
                           
                              P

                              )
                           
                         on the C-Bézier curve (1) is regarded as the point

                        , where 
                           
                              R

                         is a vector starting from the center of an ellipse and ending at a point on the rim of the ellipse, seen in Fig. 3
                        . For simplicity, we call 
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                         the ellipse radius vector of 
                           
                              P

                              t
                              )
                           
                         in the paper.

Therefore, any C-Bézier curve (1) describes the trajectory of a point making a revolution in an elliptical orbit while the orbit plane is translating with the ellipse center along a Bézier curve. From Theorem 2.1, the control points of the center Bézier curve can be explicitly represented as a linear combination of the C-Bézier’s control points. About the ellipse, we separately set

                              describes the revolution angle from the start point to the end point of   (1)   if the ellipse is changed into a circle through an affine transformation.
                           

If the C-Bézier’s control points are all coplanar, then the ellipse lies on the same plane as the center Bézier curve. Fig. 6
                         gives an example, where 
                           α
                           =
                           1
                         and the ellipse is a circle. So 
                           α
                         is the revolution angle.

If 
                           α
                           →
                           0
                        , then (1) converges to a Bézier curve of degree

                        . The center Bézier curve is a single point, i.e. the center of the circle. 
                           α
                         is just the central angle corresponding to the C-Bézier arc.

A common helix is a 3D curve that turns around an axis at a constant distance while moving uniformly parallel to the axis.

                        l
                     , then the C-Bézier curve (1) is a segment of a prolate cycloid, a common cycloid, a curtate cycloid, seen in Fig. 12(a)–(c), respectively.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we consider the geometric shapes for C-Bézier curves over 
                        
                           
                              Γ
                           
                           
                              n
                           
                        
                     . Theorem 3.1 answers the two questions in Section  1.

Our main results include: the transformation matrixes between any C-Bézier curve and its separated-form; the geometric shape and the explicit expressions of the geometric characters of any C-Bézier curve; the sufficient and necessary conditions for the C-Bézier basis constructing some classical curves (ellipse, helix, etc.). The results show the geometric means of C-Bézier curves, so that some classical curves can be constructed intuitively.
