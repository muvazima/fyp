                  Steganography has become a hot topic in information hiding, and the reversibility technology allows the recovery of the original image without distortion when the embedded secret information is extracted. In this paper, a high payload image steganographic scheme based on an extended interpolating method is proposed. In the premise of image quality assurance, the proposed scheme increases the capacity by maximizing the difference between neighboring pixels. Meanwhile, it has low complexity and retains good image quality. Extensive experiments on images have been conducted and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than several state-of-the-art methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Information hiding is a significant information security technology [1]. There are three major research aspects in an information hiding system: security, robustness and capacity. Steganography, the study of techniques for hiding the existence of a secondary message in the presence of a primary message, has become an important branch of information hiding. More and more researchers have devoted to the study of steganographic methods in order to protect secret information in the past 10years.

With the development of computer network technology and image processing technology, digital images are extensively used online in our daily life. Due to their format redundancy, a large number of digital images have been widely used in information hiding systems. The capacities (or embedding rates) are the number of secret messages embedded in each pixel of cover images [2,3]. The least significant bit (LSB) of pixel values is a popular technique used in the spatial domain because of its direct and simple operation. Now, many reversible steganographic algorithms have been proposed [4–16].

Using the difference expansion of a generalized integer transform, Alattar presented a reversible watermark method with a very high capacity [4]. Celik et al. proposed a novel lossless and reversible information hiding method which may recover the reliable data of original image when extracting the embedded secret information [5]. Ni et al. showed a new reversible information hiding algorithm which can regain the original images from the stego images without any distortion after the hidden secret information had been extracted [6]. Weng et al. introduced a novel reversible information hiding algorithm using an improved difference expansion method (DE) [7]. Jung et al. applied the image interpolation to information hiding method which gained high capacity and good image quality [8]. Using the interpolation-error, e.g., the difference between interpolation value and corresponding pixel value, Luo et al. proposed a reversible image watermarking method [9]. Lee et al. designed an efficient image interpolation for information hiding in order to increase the payload (INP) [10]. To diminish the image distortion of high payload information methods, Ou et al. presented a reversible watermarking based on optional prediction-error histogram modification to improve the watermarked image fidelity (or quality) at high embedding rate [11]. Wang et al. proposed a high quality image information hiding scheme by classifying all the image pixels into wall pixels and non-wall pixels [12]. Pei et al. improved embedding capacity of information hiding by using histogram shifting and adaptive embedding [13]. Unlike existing reversible information hiding methods of spatial-domain images, Qian et al. presented a framework of reversible information hiding in an encrypted JPEG bitstream [14]. With the visual quality being preserved, Wu et al. proposed a novel reversible information hiding algorithm for digital images [15]. Using the minimum rate criterion and optimized histograms modification, Hu et al. designed a pixel prediction method applied to reversible information hiding [16].

The interpolation is an important method in digital image processing, by which a small image is scaled up. Through the different interpolation calculations, the different results are obtained. Furthermore, different image capacity and quality will be obtained after using the different interpolation techniques [17,18]. In recent years, the interpolation methods have been widely applied in medical digital imaging processing [19]. The medical digital imaging requires a large amount of data to store patient diagnosis information. Hence, it is meaningful to design interpolation techniques to recover original image better while maintaining high capacity. Jung and Yoo showed the use of image interpolation in the spatial domain of data hiding by Neighbor Mean Interpolation (NMI) [8,10]. Lee and Huang presented an image information hiding method using Interpolation by Neighboring Pixels (INP) [10] which outperformed the [8]. The experimental results showed that the INP had high capacity (up to 2.28bpp). Therefore, it has been widely used in medical digital image processing.

Based on the above analysis, a higher payload reversible steganography using the extended image interpolation, that is, Interpolation by Maximizing the difference values between Neighboring Pixels (IMNP), is proposed in this paper. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the image interpolation technique and information hiding scheme proposed by Jung et al. [8] and Lee et al. [10]. Section 3 describes the proposed information hiding scheme and shows how the embedding capacity in the image interpolating method can be enhanced while preserving good image quality. The experimental results and analysis are outlined in Section 4. Conclusions are finally drawn in Section 5.

The advantages of interpolation method are of high speed and low time complexity. In this section, some classic interpolation algorithms are reviewed, including NMI [8] and INP on maximum difference values [10].

Let the original image and scaling-up image be O and C, respectively. The NMI calculates the mean based on the neighboring pixel values, and inserts it into the scaling-up image C as a pixel. The NMI is calculated as follows: for a

                        . The NMI can embed a large amount of secret information while keeping good image quality. The experimental results of NMI show that the average stego image quality is 24.44 (dB) measured by peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which is better than the similar algorithms proposed before. Meanwhile, the NMI method has the advantages of high speed and low-time complexity. Therefore, the NMI is suitable for application of interpolation calculation with a large number of images.

Firstly, the INP method changes a 
                           
                              M
                              ×
                              N
                           
                         size input image I down to 1/4 of itself, and makes it as an original image O. Secondly, the INP uses an interpolation method to enlarge O to form a 
                           
                              M
                              ×
                              N
                           
                         cover image C. And then, a 
                           
                              M
                              ×
                              N
                           
                         stego image S comes into being from the cover image C after embedding secret information. The receiver can recover the original image O after the embedded secret information is extracted from the stego image S. Please refer to [10] for the more detailed description of embedding and extracting procedures.

In order to improve the embedding capacity, we design a novel image interpolating technique based on INP [10], where a cover image C is produced by an extended image interpolating technique. So the performance of this method is closely related to that of the extended image interpolation technique. The method increases embedding capacity largely by changing the difference between adjacent pixels. The embedding and extracting procedures are described in detail in Section 3.

                     N. I is resized to be an original image O whose size is 1/4 of I. The proposed IMNP method makes full use of similar properties of adjacent pixels in the original image O to produce a M

                      512 and 512 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      384 (or 384 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      512) in size, respectively) are downloaded from [20,21] and the Internet. The detailed experiments are as follows.

Firstly, five images are randomly selected as input images I (shown in Fig. 1
                     ). The input images I are the images marked by (a), (d), (g), (j) and (m), respectively. The cover images C are the images marked by (b), (e), (h), (k) and (n), respectively. The stego images S are the images marked by (c), (f), (i), (l) and (o), respectively. The PSNR is used to evaluate the image quality of the input images I and the stego images S. If PSNR is more than 30dB, distortion in the stego image is usually imperceptible to human eyes [10].

In the IMNP experiment, each input 512 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      512 or 512 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      384 (or 384 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      512) grayscale image I is firstly changed down to 256 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      256 or 256 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      192 (or 192 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      256) using image processing tools, such as Adobe Photoshop 
                     
                        
                           CS
                           6.0
                        
                     , and taken it is as the original image O. Secondly, using Eq. (1), a cover image C is produced for hiding information whose size is 512 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      512 or 512 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      384 (or 384 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      512).

An example is illustrated by image Lena. Firstly, the image marked by (a) in Fig. 1 is used as an input image I. Secondly, an original image O is produced by image processing tools, such as Adobe Photoshop 
                     
                        
                           CS
                           6.0
                        
                     . Thirdly, a cover image C is generated according to Eq. (1) on the basis of original image O, such as (b) (shown in Fig. 1). Then, a stego image S comes into being, such as (c) (shown in Fig. 1) after the secret information is embedded. The distortion in the stego image C is imperceptible to human eyes as shown in Fig. 1 because PSNR is greater than 30 (dB).

Five 8-bit gray scale test images (shown in Fig. 1) selected randomly with 512 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      512 in size are used in the next group of experiments. The experimental results of image quality between each input image I and the corresponding stego image S are shown in Table 1
                     .

There are six kinds of image processing ways (or methods) in Adobe Photoshop 
                     
                        
                           CS
                           6.0
                        
                     : “Nearest Neighbor”, “Bilinear”, “Bicubic”, “Bicubic Smoother”, “Bicubic Sharper” and “Bicubic Automatically”, (shown respectively in Table 1). The capacity obtained by “Nearest Neighbor” is the largest one in the six kinds of image processing ways. However, if PSNR is smaller than 30dB, distortion in the stego image usually may be more easily perceived by human eyes. If the capacity and image quality are comprehensively considered at the same time, the results obtained from the methods of “Bicubic Sharper” and “Bicubic Automatically” are the best ones in the six kinds of methods.

For example, the capacity of Image01 is 2.2559 (bpp) in our method using Bicubic Sharper from Table 1. Under the same conditions, the capacity of Image01 is 1.7830 (bpp) in INP method using Bicubic Sharper. Clearly, the capacity of IMNP is higher than that of INP substantially for five test images in Table 1. PSNR of Image01 is 31.2905 (dB) in our method using Bicubic Sharper. Under the same conditions, PSNR of Image01 is 30.8991 (dB) in INP method using Bicubic Sharper. Furthermore, the image quality of the proposed scheme (IMNP) is superior to that of the INP scheme by Lee and Huang [10] for five test images in Table 1. It demonstrates that the extended image interpolation technique of the IMNP method can be better applied to information hiding with the improved capacity.

And then, one hundred 8-bit gray scale randomly selected test images (512 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      384 or 384 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      512) are used in the second experiment, which involves the comparison of image interpolation and information hiding schemes.

The pure payloads (bits) of 100 images selected at random are listed in Fig. 2
                      for a comparison between IMNP and other reversible methods, such as INP and NMI methods. The sizes of test images are 512 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      384 or 384 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      512. From Fig. 2, we can see the experimental results of IMNP gain a better pure capacity than other methods. The maximum and minimum values of pure payloads (bits) are 528,472 and 100,426, respectively. Note that the pure payload represents amount of largest pure payload.

The payloads (bpp) of 100 images selected at random are listed in Fig. 3
                      for a comparison between IMNP and other reversible methods. The sizes of test images are 512 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      384 or 384 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      512. The maximum and minimum values of payloads (bpp) are 2.6879 (bpp) and 0.7869 (bpp), respectively. Note that the payload represents the amount of highest payload.

The PSNRs (dB) of 100 images selected randomly are listed in Fig. 4
                      for a comparison between IMNP and other reversible methods. The sizes of test images are 512 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      384 or 384 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      512. The maximum and minimum values of PSNRs (dB) are 40.9068 (dB) and 29.7405 (dB), respectively. The number of images whose PSNRs (dB) are smaller than 30 (dB) is two in IMNP. The number of images whose PSNRs (dB) are smaller than 30 (dB) is three in INP. Under the same conditions, there are 29.4890 (dB) and 29.3952 (dB) in INP or 29.9651 (dB) and 29.6284 (dB) in NMI. Note that PSNR represents the amount of best PSNR. Figs. 4 and 5
                      show that the proposed method IMNP has larger information embedding capacity and higher PSNR.

The IMNP could embed more information compared with other reversible methods and contain highest capacity and keep good visual quality as shown in Fig. 4, which the PSNR is guaranteed to be higher than 30dB. Fig. 5 shows that IMNP has a larger improvement in the capacity or payload compared with the scheme of NMI and INP.

                      in Eq. (4) in IMNP method (shown in Fig. 6
                     ). The number of replaced pixels is from 528 up to 56,356. That is to say, the rates of pixels replaced between input image and stego image range from 0.2% up to 21.4%. The sizes of test images are 512

                           ×
                        
                      512. Note that the number of pixel of

                           y
                           )
                        
                      is replaced by 
                        
                           I
                           (
                           x

                           y
                           )
                        
                      between input image and stego image represents the maximal amount of image pixels.

Finally, the proposed method is compared with other three state-of-the-art reversible watermarking or data hiding methods, which are Ou et al.’s method [11], Wang et al.’s algorithm [12] and Pei et al.’s scheme [13]. All these images are downloaded from USC-SIPI [20]. Four standard 512 
                        
                           ×
                        
                      512 sized gray scale images are randomly selected and used in the experiments: “Lena”, “Baboon”, “Airplane” and “Boat”. The experimental results are reported in Table 2
                     .

From Table 2, we can see that the IMNP provides a better payload (bpp) than other three methods, e.g., Ou et al.’s method [11], Wang et al.’s algorithm [12] and Pei et al.’s scheme [13]. In comparison with other reversible data methods, the experimental results have shown that the proposed method provides a better capacity to hide information.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, the image interpolation techniques are analyzed, a novel interpolation technology is proved to be applicable to information hiding. Moreover, a novel reversible steganography based on the extended image interpolation technique is designed. Under the conditions of ensuring the image quality, the IMNP maximizes the difference values between neighboring pixels and improves the capacity. The IMNP scheme still has the advantage of low computing complexity and has better performance between interpolating pixels. The IMNP can gain higher capacity than other methods, e.g., NMI, INP, Ou et al.’s method and Wang et al.’s algorithm.

In addition, the IMNP gains higher PSNRs than other methods, e.g., NMI, INP and Pei et al.’s method. The results show that the performance of the proposed image information hiding method is superior to that of NMI, INP and Pei et al.’s algorithm in the aspect of image quality. Compared with NMI, the experimental results of IMNP present the capacity is improved up from 74.6% to 246.5% without obviously increasing image distortion. Compared with INP, the experimental results of IMNP show that the payload is increased up from 14.6% to 35.5% without the increase of the image deformation obviously. Therefore, these substantial performance improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
