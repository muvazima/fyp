                  A stripe-patterned surface with different wettability can be effective for the passive control of droplet movement on a vertical surface. We have performed three-dimensional Lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations to investigate the effect of the pattern characteristics and liquid properties on the droplet movement. The simulation was initiated by imposing gravity on the droplet formed on the surface. The droplet moves along the direction of the pattern when the angle between the gravity and the pattern is small; however, it starts to overrun the stripes when the angle is greater than a certain value, i.e., critical angle. It is shown that the critical angle decreases as the Bond number increases while it increases as the strength of the adhesion/repulsion force increases. The droplet forms a curved asymmetric boundary on the stripe-patterned surface due to gravity and surface forces. The critical angle is also affected by the thickness of the stripes.

Control of a liquid droplet movement on a surface is an essential technology for a wide range of applications including micro-fluidic devices [1], fuel cells [2], oil recovery [3], and water gathering systems [4]. There are active and passive systems depending on whether or not it uses thermal or electrical energy to change the surface tension between the droplet and surface. Examples of active systems include a switchable thermo-sensitive surface [5], which is used as a micro-fluidic valve for a lab-on-a-chip system [6]. Lahann et al. [7] showed that the contact angle of liquid droplet changes on a switchable surface in response to an electrical potential. Using two sets of opposing planar electrodes fabricated on glass substrates, Pollack et al. [8] demonstrated positional and formational control of micro-droplets by electrowetting-based actuation. Small droplets in micro-scale can be effectively controlled by an active system; however, it may not be a feasible technique in macro-scale due to an excessive cost to cover a large area [9]. A passive system, however, utilizes the permanent wettability gradient with no external energy input and therefore, it can only change the direction of the droplet movement. Wettability gradient can be achieved by a chemical gradient surface [10] and a textured glass structure with a wide range of curvature gradients [11]. Xu et al. showed that a water droplet can follow the S-curved line having different wettability on a declined surface [12]. Suzuki et al. showed that a water droplet can move along the direction of the stripe pattern that has different wettability [13]. Among various surface patterns, the stripe pattern has the maximum difference in wettability between the vertical and horizontal directions [14].

In a passive system utilizing the stripe pattern with different wettability, the movement of droplets is affected by gravity, liquid property, and several surface features including stripe thickness, the strength of surface force, and the slope of the pattern to gravity. Suzuki et al. showed the sliding behavior of water droplets on a stripe-patterned surface for two different wettability conditions and stripe thicknesses [13]. He observed that the droplet boundary is distorted on the patterned surface but it was difficult to determine precisely the characteristics of the droplet movement. Therefore, a three-dimensional simulation may be necessary to extensively investigate not only the details of the droplet movement on the patterned surface but also the effect of the droplet properties and pattern characteristics on the droplet movement.

Simulation of multiphase flow has been a challenging task due to the complexity of deformable and arbitrary interface between different phases. In conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, a special treatment involving techniques such as volume of fluid (VOF) [15] and level set methods [16] is necessary to determine the characteristics of the interface at every moment. The implementation of phase separation and interaction between different phases is relatively simple in the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) since the model can easily incorporate multiple components and set the interaction forces to create interface between different components. Many models have been suggested to study various interface phenomena such as the color-fluid model [17], the interparticle-potential model [18–20], the free energy model [21,22], and the mean-field theory model [23,24]. The wettability of a liquid droplet on the solid surface can be simulated by introducing interaction forces between the solid surface and the fluid. This technique has been applied to study the spreading behavior of liquid on certain substrate patterns [25,26], droplet motion on a surface with wettability gradient [27], droplet movement at the interface of different wettibilities [28], and the anisotropic wetting velocity on a stripe-patterned surface [29].

In this work, the movement of droplet on a stripe-patterned surface has been observed through three-dimensional multiphase/multicomponent LBM simulation. We have simulated the droplet movement on the vertical surface under external forces consisting of gravity and surface force. We have investigated how the movement of droplet is affected by such external forces in terms of the strength of wettability, droplet property, and several design features including stripe thickness and the slope of the pattern to gravity.

The LB model in this work is based on the multi-component multiphase interparticle potential model developed by Shan and Chen [18]. In most cases, for simplicity, it is assumed that each of the components has the same density and ideal equation of state and every two components are separated by a repulsive force. The distribution function for each component has the same relaxation time in a three-dimensional 19-speed (D3Q19) lattice, as described by the following equation:

The bottom surface where the droplet is formed and the top surface that is parallel to the bottom surface were treated as solid walls using the bounce back scheme [31]. Periodic conditions were applied for other two pairs of parallel surfaces.

The lattice units (lu), time steps (ts), and mass units (mu) are the units of length, time, and mass, respectively.


                     Fig. 1
                      shows the schematic diagram of the droplet on the stripe-patterned surface. An additional set of coordinates is introduced to indicate the direction of the pattern: direction 1 is the longitudinal direction of the pattern and direction 2 is normal to direction 1 on the x–y plane. The numerical domain consists of 80 × 80 × 40 lattice points in the 1-, 2-, and z-direction, respectively. The simulation starts from creating a half-sphere droplet on the vertical wall. The radius, r0
                     , of the droplet is initially given as 25 lu. The density and viscosity are the same for the two components and component 1 represents the droplet. The density of component 1 is set as 1.0 inside the droplet and 0.01 outside the droplet. The density of component 2 is set as vice versa. The interparticle strengths are given as

                      varies for different contact angles. The boundary of the droplet is assumed to exist where the density of fluid 1 is 0.5. The droplet deforms from its original shape due to uneven surface forces at the droplet boundary. We assumed that the droplet reached its steady shape when the variance of the total weight is less than 10−6 % with time.

For a given pattern geometry and surface characteristics, the droplet movement may be mainly affected by the relative strength of gravity to surface force. The droplet tends to move in the direction of the pattern when the effect of gravity is relatively small. When the effect of gravity is significant, the droplet may fall in the direction of gravity, overrunning the stripes. The relative strength of gravity to surface force is characterized by the Bond number, Bo, as:

                        where σ is the surface tension, ρ is the density, g is acceleration due to gravity, and A is the cross-sectional area of the droplet [32]. In this work, we have chosen a range of Bond numbers from 0.1 to 0.3 to guarantee the reasonable movement of the droplet on the patterned surface. The effect of Bond number on the droplet trajectory is discussed in Section 4.3.

When the droplet is very small, the droplet movement may be affected mainly by the surface force. A small droplet formed on the hydrophilic surface tends to move slowly along the pattern, sticking to the surface. A droplet formed on the hydrophobic surface, on the other hand, comes off. When the droplet is too large, i.e., larger than the stripe thickness, the movement is governed by gravity and the effect of the surface forces and pattern characteristics become negligible. These are outside the scope of the present work. The droplet diameter and the stripe thickness were fixed at 25 and 8 lu, respectively, for most simulations in this work, except for the analysis of the effect of stripe thickness on droplet trajectory, as reported in Section 4.3.

In this section, we examine the effect of pattern angle on the trajectory of the droplet movement. G
                        1s
                         is set to 0.3 on the hydrophobic and –0.3 on the hydrophilic surfaces. Fig. 4(
                        a) shows a typical shape of a droplet formed on the patterned surface. The droplet boundary is drawn inward on the hydrophobic surface, but pushed outward on the hydrophilic surface. Gravity forces were applied to all particles after the droplet reached a steady state. Under the force of gravity, the droplet sagged and began to slide along the pattern as shown in Fig. 4(b).


                        Fig. 5
                        (a) shows various droplet trajectories for pattern angles from 0° to 90° at intervals of 15°. The droplet was released from the upper right corner of the plane, and allowed to propagate under the force of gravity, which acts in the y-direction. When the pattern angle is 0°, 15°, and 30° the droplet trajectory follows the pattern. However, when the pattern angle is 45° or greater, the droplet follows the pattern intermittently, occasionally overrunning the pattern in the y direction before returning to follow the pattern stripes. As the pattern angle increases, the overruns occur more frequently and dominate, resulting in less travel distance for the same period of time. The droplet falls vertically for pattern angles of 0° and 90° without any lateral movement; however, the total distance travelled at 90° is significantly less than that at 0°, due to these overruns. To determine the critical pattern angle, αc
                        , which is the maximum angle at which the droplet will not overrun, simulations were performed between 30° and 45° at intervals of 1°. The results are shown in Fig. 5(b). The overrun first occurs at a pattern angle of 35°, and therefore, αc
                         is 34° for these gravity and surface parameters. Fig. 6
                         shows the average angle of trajectory for each pattern angle. The average angle of trajectory is the average angle of the droplet's final and initial positions in one period of cycle. The average angle of trajectory is the same as the pattern angle when overruns do not occur. It decreases, however, when the pattern angle is greater than the critical angle, due to these overruns. The average angle of trajectory is an important characteristic of the patterned surface that determines the direction of the droplet movement. As further discussed in Section 4.3, the droplet trajectory is also affected by the droplet and surface characteristics.


                        Fig. 7
                         shows the time history of the boundary of the droplet, as the droplet slides on the pattern for two different pattern angles. The droplet's trajectory matches the pattern angle when the pattern angle is 30°, as shown in Fig. 7(a). In Fig. 7(b), when the pattern angle is 45°, it overruns the stripes as it moves. The first image in Fig. 7(b) shows the initial stages of overrun, in which the lower boundary of the droplet is pulled onto the hydrophilic surface, the grey stripes, by gravity. In the second image, the lower boundary of the droplet quickly spreads out onto the hydrophilic surface due to gravity and surface adhesion forces, while the upper boundary is still attached to the interface between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic stripes. In the final image, the upper boundary quickly crosses the hydrophobic surface, while the lower boundary is pulled downward onto the next hydrophilic stripe, reinitiating the overrun process. This process repeats periodically as the droplet continues to move. Fig. 8(
                        a) shows the temporal evolution of the droplet's mass center in the z direction. The droplet center drops during the initial overrun stages, since the droplet spreads out on the hydrophilic surface, as shown in the first and second images in Fig. 7 (b). It rounds out later and slightly overshoots when the upper boundary crosses the hydrophobic surface. The period of oscillation for each pattern angle ≥45° is shown in Fig. 8(b). The period of oscillation is smaller for larger pattern angles, indicating that overruns occur more frequently as the pattern angle increases. It can be noted that the droplet center's displacement is still oscillatory when the pattern angle is 90°, even though the trajectory is along the direction of gravity.

The droplet boundary is pushed inward on the hydrophobic surface, while it is forced outward on the hydrophilic surface. The boundary of the right section is stretched onto the hydrophobic surface due to gravity, while the boundary of left section is still stuck at the interface. This is a typical shape of the droplet boundary when the pattern angle is between 0° and 90o.

The force F per unit length imposed to the triple phase boundary line can be written as:

                        [34]. γ is the surface tension and θA

                        (a)]. The sum of unit forces at the triple phase boundary line is calculated when the pattern angles are 0° and 30°. When the pattern angle is 0°, both γcos θA
                         and γcos θB

mu · lu/ts
                        2 [Fig 9(b)], and hence the total force on the droplet is zero. On the contrary, γcos θA
                         and γcos θB
                         are 20.33 and 5.86 mu · lu/ts
                        2, respectively, when the pattern angle is 30° [Fig 9 (c)]. In this case, the total force is 14.43 mu · lu/ts
                        2 in direction 2. This means that the total force is generated by the asymmetry in the shape of the droplet caused by external conditions. If this force is equal to the other forces, the droplet moves along only direction 1. The total force is affected by the surface conditions and gravity. Therefore, the relationship between the total force and critical angle will be considered from now on.


                        Fig. 10(
                        a) shows the average angle of trajectory for different pattern angles when the Bond number is set to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. The radius of the droplet was set to 25 lu, the density to 1.00 mu, and the surface tension to 0.1091 mu·ts−2. The acceleration due to gravity varied from 1.1 × 10−5 to 3.3 × 10−5 lu·ts−2, causing the Bond number to vary from 0.1 to 0.3. G
                        1s
                         was set to 0.2, as discussed in the previous sections. When the Bond number is 0.1, the average angle of trajectory is the same as the pattern angle, indicating that the droplet moves along the direction of the pattern. It should be noted that the droplet is stagnant at its origin when the pattern angle is 90°, since gravity is not strong enough to initiate an overrun. When the Bond number is greater than 0.1 and the pattern angle is greater than the critical angle, the droplet starts to overrun. The critical angle decreases as the Bond number increases though total forces are similar, as shown in Fig. 10(b). The total force at the triple phase boundary line does not show any significant change for varying Bond numbers.

                        , is 1.0, the average angle of trajectory is the same as the pattern angle, indicating that no overruns occur. However, as shown in Fig. 11(b), the droplet does overrun the pattern when ΔG
                        1s
                         is small, and as ΔG
                        1s
                        
 increases, the critical pattern angle increases, and the larger force gradient between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces results in a greater total force exerted on the droplet. The critical pattern angle can be controlled through the selection of ΔG
                        1s
                        ; however, droplet movements may become sluggish when ΔG
                        1s
                         is too large, due to excessive adhesion on the hydrophilic surface.

                        Fig. 13(a) shows the average angle of trajectory for various pattern angles when the stripe thickness, Δs, is 4, 8, or 12 lu, while keeping other conditions constant. The average angle of trajectory shows similar trends for these three cases; however, a thicker stripe leads to a larger critical pattern angle. In Fig. 13(b), which introduces stripe thicknesses of 6 and 10 lu, the critical pattern angle increases as the stripe thickness increases, except when the stripe thickness is 10 lu. It should be noted that the total force at the triple phase boundary line shows a similar trend with the critical pattern angle in Fig. 13(b). The sudden decrease in total force is related to the boundary shape, since the total force arises from asymmetric deformation of the boundary on the patterned surface.


                        Fig. 14 shows the droplet boundaries for the five stripe thicknesses used in Fig. 13(b), at the critical pattern angles. The shape of the boundary for cases (a), (b), (c), and (e) are typical as explained in the previous section. The boundary shape for case (d) is unusual as the left and right-end boundary sections show the opposite shape compared to the other cases. Although not shown here, the boundary shapes for all other stripe thicknesses tested, including 9 and 11 lu, are similar with those of the other usual cases. This may indicate that case (d) in Fig. 14 is the result of a particular dynamic equilibrium that may not be common in the real world. Nevertheless, as shown in Figs. 11–13, the asymmetry of the droplet shape may be the most influential factor on the critical pattern angle, as long as the effect of gravity is constant.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The movement of a droplet on a vertical stripe-patterned surface has been investigated using a three-dimensional LBM simulation. The droplet tends to move along the direction of the pattern when the pattern angle is small; however, it starts to overrun the stripes as the pattern angle increases. The critical angle is the maximum pattern angle at which the droplet will not overrun. It has been shown that the critical angle increases with increasing Bond number, stripe thickness, and the gradient of the adhesion/repulsion force of the patterned surface. The droplet forms an asymmetric curved boundary on the patterned surface and the total force at the triple phase boundary line has a significant impact on the critical angle. The LB model is an efficient numerical tool to investigate multiphase flow phenomenon especially when the surface conditions are complicated. However, the model used in this work is limited to a small density ratio between fluids and therefore requires further improvements to handle cases with a larger density ratio.
