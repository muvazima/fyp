                  The paper presents a generalized regression technique centered on a superquantile (also called conditional value-at-risk) that is consistent with that coherent measure of risk and yields more conservatively fitted curves than classical least-squares and quantile regression. In contrast to other generalized regression techniques that approximate conditional superquantiles by various combinations of conditional quantiles, we directly and in perfect analog to classical regression obtain superquantile regression functions as optimal solutions of certain error minimization problems. We show the existence and possible uniqueness of regression functions, discuss the stability of regression functions under perturbations and approximation of the underlying data, and propose an extension of the coefficient of determination R-squared for assessing the goodness of fit. The paper presents two numerical methods for solving the error minimization problems and illustrates the methodology in several numerical examples in the areas of uncertainty quantification, reliability engineering, and financial risk management.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Analysts and decision makers are often concerned with a random variable describing possible ‘cost,’ ‘loss,’ or ‘damage.’ The interest may be focused on a single ‘system’ or could involve study and comparison across a multitude of systems and designs. In either case, it may be beneficial to attempt to approximate such a loss random variable Y in terms of an n-dimensional explanatory random vector X that is more accessible in some sense. This situation naturally leads to least-squares regression and related models that estimate conditional expectations. While such models are adequate in many situations, they fall short in contexts where a decision maker is risk averse, i.e., is more concerned about upper-tail realizations of Y than average loss, and views errors asymmetrically with underestimating losses being more detrimental than overestimating. We focus on such contexts and therefore maintain an orientation of Y that implies that high realizations are unfortunate and low realizations are favorable. Of course, a parallel development with an opposite orientation of the random variable Y, focused on profits and gains, and concerns about overestimating instead of underestimating is also possible but not pursued here.

Quantile regression (see Gilchrist, 2008; Koenker, 2005 and references therein) accommodates risk-averseness and an asymmetric view of errors by estimating conditional quantiles at a certain probability level such as those in the tail of the conditional distribution of Y. While suitable in some contexts, quantile regression only deals with the signs of the errors and therefore is overly ‘robust’ in the sense that large portions of a data set can change dramatically without impacting the best-fitting regression function. A quantile corresponds to ‘value-at-risk’ (VaR) in financial terminology and relates to ‘failure probability’ in engineering terms. Quantile regression informs the decision maker about these quantities conditional on values of the explanatory random vector X. However, a quantile is not a coherent measure of risk in the sense of Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, and Heath (1999) (see also Delbaen, 2002); it fails to be subadditive. Consequently, a quantile of the sum of two random variables may exceed the sum of the quantiles of each random variable at the same probability level, which runs counter to our understanding of what ‘risk’ should express. Moreover, quantiles cause computational challenges when incorporated into decision optimization problems as objective function, failure probability constraint, or chance constraint. The use of quantiles and the closely related failure probabilities is therefore problematic in risk-averse decision making; see (Artzner et al., 1999; Krokhmal, Zabarankin, & Uryasev, 2011; Rockafellar & Royset, 2010; Rockafellar & Uryasev, 2000, 2013) for a detailed discussion.

A superquantile of a random variable, also called conditional value-at-risk, average value-at-risk, and expected shortfall,
                        1
                        We prefer the application-neutral name ‘superquantile’ when deriving methods applicable broadly.
                     
                     
                        1
                      is an ‘average’ of certain quantiles as described further below. It is a coherent measure of risk well suited for risk-averse decision making and optimization; see (Wang & Uryasev, 2007) for its application in financial engineering, (Kalinchenko, Veremyev, Boginski, Jeffcoat, & Uryasev, 2011) for military applications, and (Rockafellar & Royset, 2010) for use in reliability engineering. While this risk measure has reached prominence in risk-averse optimization, there has been much less work on regression techniques that are consistent in some sense with it. In this paper, we derive such a superquantile regression methodology, study its properties, and propose means to assess the goodness-of-fit. The importance of such a regression methodology becomes apparent by considering the following two situations.

Suppose that a loss is given by a random variable Y, but our primary concern is with the conditional loss given that an explanatory random vector X takes on specific values. We aim to select these values judiciously in an effort to minimize the conditional loss. We denote by 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                      the conditional random variable Y given that 
                        
                           X
                           =
                           x
                           ∈
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                        
                     . Of course, ‘minimizing’ 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                      is not well-defined and a standard approach is to minimize a risk measure of 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                     ; see for example (Krokhmal et al., 2011; Rockafellar & Uryasev, 2013). An attractive choice is to use a superquantile measure of risk, which as mentioned above is coherent and also computationally approachable. While in some contexts a superquantile of 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                      can be evaluated easily for any 
                        
                           x
                           ∈
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                        
                     , there are numerous situations, especially beyond the financial domain, where only a data base of realizations of 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                      is available for various x. In the latter situation, there is a need for building an approximating model, based on the data, for the relevant superquantile of 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                      as a function of x. We refer to this as superquantile tracking. In comparison, if the goal were to minimize the expectation of 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                     , then least-squares regression would yield a model that approximates that conditional expectation. Likewise, if the goal were to minimize a quantile of 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                     , quantile regression would provide a model of the conditional quantile. While these models are valuable for analysts and decision makers focused on the expectation and quantile risk measures, they do not provide estimates of conditional superquantiles. In essence, the same need for estimating conditional superquantiles arises in reliability engineering when the goal is to determine a ‘design’ x with buffered failure probability of 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                      being no larger than a given probability level, which corresponds to a constraint on a superquantile of 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                      (Rockafellar & Royset, 2010).

Another situation arises when the explanatory random vector X is beyond our direct control, but the dependence between the loss random variable Y and X makes us hopeful that, for a carefully selected regression function 
                     
                        
                           f
                           :
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                           →
                           R
                        
                     , the random variable 
                        
                           f
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                      may serve as a surrogate for Y. When the distribution of X is known, at least approximately, and f has been determined, then the distribution of 
                        
                           f
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                      is usually easily accessible. That distribution may then serve as input to further analysis, simulation, and optimization in place of the unknown distribution of Y. Such surrogate estimation may arise in numerous contexts. ‘Factor models’ in financial investment applications (see for example Conner, 1995; Knight & Satchell, 2005), where Y may be the loss associated with a particular asset and X a vector describing a small number of macroeconomic ‘factors,’ is a result of surrogate estimation. ‘Uncertainty quantification’ (see for example Eldred, Swiler, & Tang, 2011; Lee & Chen, 2009) considers the output of a system described by a random variable Y, for example measuring damage, and estimates its moments and distribution from observed realizations as well as knowledge about the distribution of the input to the system characterized by a random vector X. A main approach here centers on surrogate estimation with 
                        
                           f
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                      serving as an estimate of Y. In this situation, an essential question is what criterion should be used for selecting f. Clearly, one would like the error random variable 
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 Z
                              
                              
                                 f
                              
                           
                           ≔
                           Y
                           -
                           f
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                      to be small in some sense. However, minimizing the mean-squared error of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 Z
                              
                              
                                 f
                              
                           
                        
                      would not reflect a greater concern about underestimating Y, i.e., underestimating losses, than overestimating. We may want to assess the error of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 Z
                              
                              
                                 f
                              
                           
                        
                      in a manner that is ‘consistent’ with our use of a superquantile as risk measure and weigh large levels of underestimation more heavily than smaller levels.

In this paper, we develop a ‘generalized’ regression technique that addresses the issue of superquantile tracking and surrogate estimation. The technique is an extension of least-squares and quantile regression, which center on expectations and quantiles, respectively, to one that focuses on superquantiles.

The foundation of least-squares and quantile regression is the fact that mean and quantiles minimize the expectation of certain convex random functions. A natural extension to superquantile regression could then possibly involve determining a random function that when minimizing its expectation, we obtain a superquantile. However, such a random function does not exist (Chun, Shapiro, & Uryasev, 2012; Gneiting, 2011), which has lead to studies of indirect approaches to superquantile tracking grounded in quantile regression.

For a random variable with a continuous cumulative distribution function, a superquantile equals a conditional expectation of the random variable given realizations no lower than the corresponding quantile. Utilizing this fact, studies have developed kernel-based estimators for the conditional probability density functions, which are then integrated and inverted to obtain estimators of conditional quantiles. An estimator of the conditional superquantile is then finally constructed by integrating the density estimator over the interval above the quantile (Cai & Wang, 2008; Scaillet, 2005) or forming a sample average (Kato, 2012). These studies also include asymptotic analysis of the resulting estimators under a series of assumptions, including that the data originates from certain time series.

A superquantile of a random variable is defined in terms of an integral of corresponding quantiles with respect to the probability level. Since the integral is approximated by a weighted sum of quantiles across different probability levels, an estimator of a conditional superquantile emerges as the sum of conditional quantiles obtained by quantile regression; see (Leorato, Peracchi, & Tanase, 2012; Peracchi & Tanase, 2008), which also show asymptotic results under a set of assumptions including the continuous differentiability of the cumulative distribution function of the conditional random variables. Similarly, (Chun et al., 2012) utilizes the integral expression for a superquantile, but observes that a weighted sum of quantiles is an optimal solution of a certain minimization problem; see (Rockafellar & Uryasev, 2013). Analogously to the situation in least-squares and quantile regression, an optimization problem therefore yields an estimator of a conditional superquantile. Though, in contrast to the case of least-squares and quantile regression, the estimator is ‘biased’ due to the error induced by replacing an integral by a finite sum. Under a linear model assumption, (Chun et al., 2012) also constructs a conditional superquantile estimator using an appropriately shifted least-squares regression curve based on quantile estimates of residuals. In both cases, asymptotic results are obtained for a homoscedastic linear regression model. Under the same model, (Trindade, Uryasev, Shapiro, & Zrazhevsky, 2007) studies ‘constrained’ regression, where the error random variable 
                        
                           
                              
                                 Z
                              
                              
                                 f
                              
                           
                           =
                           Y
                           -
                           f
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                      is minimized in some sense, for example in terms of least square or absolute deviation, subject to a constraint that limits a superquantile of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 Z
                              
                              
                                 f
                              
                           
                        
                     . While this approach does not lead to superquantile regression in the sense we derive below, it highlights the need for alternative techniques for regression that incorporate superquantiles in some manner.

The need for moving beyond classical regression centered on conditional expectations is therefore now well recognized and has driven even further research towards estimating conditional distribution function, i.e., 
                        
                           Prob
                           (
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           ⩽
                           y
                           )
                        
                      for all 
                        
                           y
                           ∈
                           R
                        
                     , using nonparametric kernel estimators (see for example Hall & Muller, 2003) and transformation models (see for example Hothorn, Kneib, & Buhlmann, in press). Of course, conditional distribution functions provide the ‘full’ information about 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                      including its quantiles and superquantiles, and therefore also provide a means to inform a risk-averse decision maker. In this paper, however, we directly focus on superquantiles, which we believe deserve special attention due to their prominence in risk analysis.

A framework for ‘generalized’ regression is laid out in Rockafellar, Uryasev, and Zabarankin (2008), Rockafellar and Uryasev (2013) and regression functions are obtained as optimal solutions of optimization problems of the form

                     , quantile regression with the Koenker–Bassett measure of error, but many other possibilities exist. While it is not possible to determine a measure of error that is of the expectation type and yields a superquantile, in this paper we show that when allowing for a broader class of functionals, a measure of error that generates a superquantile is indeed available. Such a measure of error is also hinted at in our recent paper (Rockafellar & Royset, in press), but the present paper gives the first comprehensive treatment. In contrast to previous studies towards superquantile tracking, which utilize indirect approaches and quantile regression, we here offer a natural extension of least-squares and quantile regression. We replace the mean-squares and Koenker–Bassett error measures by a new error measure, and then simply minimize that error of

                      to obtain a regression function. Under few assumptions, we establish the existence of a regression function, discuss its uniqueness, and examine stability under perturbations of the distribution of 
                        
                           (

                           Y

                      for example caused by sampling. We omit a discussion of simple linear models with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise as we believe that there is little need for quantile and superquantile regression in such contexts as least-squares regression with an appropriate shift suffices. In fact, we do not separate models into (additive) deterministic and stochastic terms. In many applications, especially in the area of uncertainty quantification, heteroscedasticity and dependence are prevalent making linear i.i.d. and additive models of little value.

The main contributions of this paper is the development of a novel regression technique that naturally extends least-squares and quantile regression to contexts where one seeks to assess regression errors not by squaring them, as in the case of least-squares regression, or by looking at their signs, as in the case of quantile regression, but by weighing larger levels of underestimation increasingly heavily in a manner consistent with superquantiles. We develop the fundamental theory for the new regression technique by examining the issues of existence, uniqueness, stability, rate of convergence, and goodness of fit.

Section 2 describes measures of regret and error, first in the context of quantile regression and then for the extension to superquantile regression. Section 3 defines superquantile regression as the minimization of a measure of error, discusses existence and uniqueness of the regression function, and provides asymptotic results. Section 4 proposes an approach for assessing the goodness-of-fit of regression function obtained by superquantile regression. Section 5 deals with computational methods for superquantile regression and Section 6 gives illustrative examples.

While our development centers on superquantiles, it is beneficial to maintain a parallel description of quantiles. As we see below, quantile regression, which is achieved by minimizing a Koenker–Bassett error of the random variable

                     , provides a road map for the construction of superquantile regression, which is simply achieved by minimizing another measure of error. We start, however, with definitions of quantiles, superquantiles, and corresponding measures of regret and error.

In the present context, however, connections with the underlying explanatory random vector X and the focus on the ‘approximation’ of Y warrants a parallel development to that of quantile regression centered on a superquantile. In view of the above review of quantile regression, it is clear that superquantile regression will involve the minimization of some measure of error that returns the superquantile as argmin.

                           Classical least-squares regression can be viewed similarly as returning a (conditional) expectation as argmin when minimizing mean-square measure of error, i.e.,

                        These expressions appear in Rockafellar and Royset (in press), where their discovery, which is related to the Hardy–Littlewood transform, is described. Here, we provide an alternative, direct proof of how they lead to a superquantile. We start, however, with two preliminary results and the definition of a corresponding error measure.

                              . Consequently, the first equality of the theorem holds. The second follows directly from (13) and the fact that a constant in an objective function is immaterial with regard to the argmin. □

Being analogous to (4) and (6), the foundations for quantile regression, the expressions (14) provide the path to superquantile regression as developed in the remainder of the paper. In fact, Theorem 1 shows that

While not the focus here, the optimal value in (14) defines a measure of risk (see Rockafellar & Royset, in press)

                     Theorem 1 and the development leading to quantile regression direct us to a new regression methodology that is centered on a superquantile error. The next subsection poses the regression problem, provides its properties, and discusses stability under perturbations. The section ends with a discussion of superquantile tracking.

While Theorem 1 shows that the ‘best’ scalar approximation of a random variable Y in the sense of a superquantile error is the corresponding superquantile, we now go beyond the class of constant functions to utilize the connection with an underlying explanatory random vector X. We focus on regression functions of the form

                        -dimensional optimization problem P is replaced by a problem in m dimensions with a simpler objective function, which we fully utilize in Sections 5 and 6. Moreover, the result also proves beneficial in analysis of regression vectors.

The existence of a regression vector is ensured by the next result, which also provides conditions for uniqueness.

We next examine the rate of convergence of regression vectors obtained from the approximate problem 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P

                         to those of P corresponding to the ‘true’ distribution. It appears difficult to obtain asymptotic distribution theory for superquantile regression without additional assumptions, which among other consequences should ensure unique optimal solutions of P. We prefer another route that leads to a rate of convergence result under mild assumptions.

Quantification of the stability of the set of optimal solutions of an optimization problem under perturbations depends on a ‘growth condition’ of the problem, which is difficult to quantify for P; see Rockafellar and Wets (1998, Section 7J). Consequently, we focus on the better behaved

In a situation where a sample is not fully randomly generated but x-points are determined by an analyst, the approach may even motivate scattering those points near a point of interest

                      results in the least-squares regression vector. According to Rockafellar and Uryasev (2013), these error and deviation measures are in correspondence and belong to a ‘risk quadrangle’ that yields the expectation as its statistic. This observation motivates the following definition of a coefficient of determination for superquantile regression model.

It is possible to obtain large coefficients of determination by adding explanatory terms to a regression model, i.e., increasing m, but without necessarily achieving a more useful model. Hence, it is usual in least-squares regression to also evaluate an adjusted coefficient of determination that penalizes any term added to the model that does not reduce variability substantially. This quantity only increases if a new term reduces

In this section, we illustrate superquantile regression in three numerical examples. The first example is artificially constructed, with known conditional superquantiles. The second example is an instance from the uncertainty quantification literature. The third example arises in investment analysis. Computations are mostly carried out in Matlab version 7.14 on a 2.26gigahertz laptop with 8.0gigabytes of RAM using Portfolio Safeguard (American Optimal Decisions, Inc., 2011) with VAN as the optimization solver for

We first examine the computational effort required to obtain an approximate regression vector. Table 1

                        , the times vary little between two samples of the same size and the computing times are therefore representative. As expected from the discussion at the end of Section 5.1, the computing time grows quickly as the sample size 
                           
                              ν
                           
                         increases. In addition to the inconvenience of long computing times, memory requirements become problematic.

                         has a special structure and we anticipate significant reduction in computing times and memory needs resulting from tailored algorithms. However, the development of such algorithms is beyond the scope of the paper.

Second, we consider the alternative approach based on solving

                                    ν
                                    ,
                                    μ
                                 
                              
                           
                        . While this approach introduces a numerical integration error, Proposition 6 indicates that the error is negligible for large 
                           
                              μ
                           
                        . In fact, as we see next empirically, moderately large 
                           
                              μ
                           
                         suffices. Moreover, the substantial reduction in problem size, as compared to that of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    D
                                 
                                 
                                    LP

The next example arises in uncertainty quantification of a rectangular cross section of a short structural column, with depth d and width w, under uncertain yield stress and uncertain loads, see (Eldred et al., 2011). Assuming an elastic-perfectly plastic material, a limit-state function that quantifies a relationship between loads and capacity is described by the random variable

                         independent. We observe that the second term in (39) is the ratio of moment load to the column’s moment capacity, and the third term is the square of the ratio of the axial load to the axial capacity. The constant 
                           
                              -

                         is introduced for the sake of a translation such that positive realizations of Y represent ‘failure’ and nonnegative ones correspond to a situation where load effects remain within the capacity of the column. (We note that the orientation of the limit-state function is switched compared to that of Eldred et al. (2011) for consistency with our focus on ‘losses’ instead of ‘gains.’) We set the width 
                           
                              w

                        , and the depth 
                           
                              d

                        .

We seek to quantify the ‘uncertainty’ in Y by surrogate estimation. Of course, in this case, this is hardly necessary; direct use of (39) suffices. However, in practice, an analytic expression for a limit-state function, as in (39), is rarely available. One then proceeds with determining a regression function

                         under the least-squares regression fit. While this fit provides an accurate estimate of the mean (see Column 3), the upper-tail behavior is represented in a nonconservative manner.

                        ; see the last column of Table 5. In contrast, least-squares regression underestimates the buffered failure probability substantially even for this supposedly ‘accurate’ model. Of course, least-squares regression centers on conditional expectations and as basis for estimating tail behavior may hide potentially dangerous risks.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We present a superquantile regression methodology centered on the minimization of a measure of error analogous to classical least-squares and quantile regression. We establish the existence of a regression function, discuss its possible uniqueness, and its stability under perturbation, for example caused by sample approximations of a true distribution. A new coefficient of determination allows us to quantify the goodness of fit. We show that superquantile regression requires the solution of a linear program, as in the case of quantile regression, or alternatively of an optimization problem with superquantile (conditional value-at-risk) constraints. Our computational tests demonstrate that superquantile regression is computationally tractable, provides new insight about tail-behavior for quantities of interest, and offers a complementary tool for the risk-averse decision maker.
