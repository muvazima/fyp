                  The block cipher Crypton is a 128-bit block cipher was proposed by Lim as a candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition. So far, a variety of cryptanalytic methods have been used to mount attacks on reduced-round versions of Crypton. Biclique attack is one of the most recent cryptanalytic techniques which brings new tools from the area of hash functions to the area of block cipher cryptanalysis. In this paper, using non-isomorphic biclique cryptanalysis, we propose a method to construct independent bicliques, up to five rounds, for cryptanalysis of full-round Crypton.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Block ciphers are elementary components in the design of many cryptographic protocols. Indeed, block ciphers are widely used in advanced authentication protocols like extensible and password authentication protocols [1,2]; key management [3]; as well as the building blocks of the other symmetric primitives like hash functions [4] and cryptographic PRNGs [5].

The block cipher Crypton is a 128-bit block cipher which was proposed by Lim [6]. Crypton's structure allows a high degree of parallelisms which results in highly efficiency and flexibility in both software and hardware implementations. This block cipher uses a user key of up to 256bits to generate round keys. Because of some weaknesses in the key schedule of Crypton, a revised version of this block cipher, identified by Crypton V1.0, was introduced in FSE'99 [7]. In this paper we focus on this revised version of Crypton. The lightweight block cipher mCrypton has been also developed with the same structure as Crypton V1.0 [8]. Minimizing both of the cost and power consumption makes it appropriate for using in low-cost resource-constrained devices like RFID tags [9].

In Asiacrypt'99, an impossible differential attack was proposed on 5 rounds of Crypton [10]. Also, in FSE'99 a square attack was proposed on 6 rounds of it [11]. Then, a stochastic attack was presented on 8 rounds of Crypton in FSE 2000 [12]. An impossible differential attack on 6 rounds of Crypton V1.0 was introduced in ICISC'01 [13]. Later, this result was improved to an impossible differential attack on 7 rounds of Crypton V1.0 with data complexity of 2121 chosen plaintexts and time complexity of 2116.2 7-round encryptions, which is the best known single key attack on this block cipher [14]. Also, there is a related-key impossible differential attack on 9 rounds which requires 2105 chosen plaintexts and 2243.8 9-round encryptions [15].

This paper, using a technique, called non-isomorphic biclique cryptanalysis, introduces two single key attacks on full-round Crypton V1.0. The first attack, using 4-round bicliques, requires only 244 chosen plaintexts and about 2254 full-round encryptions. For the second attack, which uses 5-round bicliques, data complexity increases to 232
                     ×(232
                     −28.2)3 (close to the entire codebook) while its time complexity decreases to about 2253.46 full-round encryptions. Obviously, these attacks can be also mounted on reduced-round versions of Crypton cipher. The following Table 1
                      summarizes cryptanalytic results on Crypton V1.0, including the results of this paper.

Biclique attack is one of the recent cryptanalytic techniques which brings new tools from the area of hash functions to the area of block cipher cryptanalysis [16,17]. This technique was the first cryptanalysis method which is able to break full-round AES in a single key mode [17]. For a brief description of the biclique cryptanalysis method, assume block cipher E which is composed of three sub-ciphers as E
                     
                        K
                     (P)=
                     f
                     
                        K
                     
                     ∘
                     g
                     
                        K
                     
                     ∘
                     h
                     
                        K
                     (P). Also the intermediate value h
                     
                        K
                     (P) is denoted by S. Suppose h connects 2
                        d
                      plaintexts P
                     
                        i
                     , 0≤
                     i
                     <2
                        d
                     , to 2
                        d
                      intermediate states S
                     
                        j
                     , 0≤
                     j
                     ≤2
                        d
                     , with 22d
                      keys K[i,
                     j]. Now, set of P
                     
                        i
                     s, S
                     
                        j
                     s and K[i,
                     j]s is called a biclique of dimension d if the relation S
                     
                        j
                     
                     =
                     h
                     
                        K[i,j](P
                     
                        i
                     ) is established for all pairs (i,
                     j), 0≤
                     i
                     <2
                        d
                     , 0≤
                     j
                     <2
                        d
                     . For performing a biclique attack on the block cipher E, at the first step, the whole of target key space is partitioned into 2
                        k
                        −2d
                      groups each of 22d
                      keys. Some matching nibbles are fixed in the output of sub-cipher g and then for each key group, according to the definition of a biclique, the biclique attack is performed based on the three major steps, including biclique construction, pre-computations (if it is needed) and matching check with re-computations. However, the most important issue is how we can make a biclique of dimension d which meets all of those 22d
                      relationships, simultaneously. Bogdanov et al. proposes an approach to find a biclique of dimension d from independent related-key differentials [17]. For this purpose, assume that we have two related-keys, ∆-differential and ∇-differential, which share no active S-boxes. Now, if Δ-differential maps an input difference Δ
                     
                        i
                      to the output difference 0 under key difference Δ
                     
                        i
                     
                     
                        K
                     , and ∇-differential maps the input difference 0 to an output difference ∇
                        j
                      under key difference ∇
                        j
                     
                     
                        K
                     , then an input difference Δ
                     
                        i
                      maps to an output difference ∇
                        j
                      under key difference Δ
                     
                        i
                     
                     
                        K
                     
                     ⊕∇
                        j
                     
                     
                        K
                      for each i and j.

Since its introduction, the biclique attack has been applied to many block ciphers such as SQUARE [18], KASUMI [19], Piccolo [20], ARIA-256 [21], HIGHT [22], TWINE [23,24], LBlock [24], Present and LED [25]. After that, the block cipher IDEA was analyzed using the narrow-biclique technique as an extension of biclique attack [26]. This technique extended the independent-biclique framework to allow for lower data complexity requirements by using available degrees of freedom for limiting the diffusion in spite of high dimension.


                     Non-isomorphic biclique cryptanalysis is also an extension of the independent biclique attack, which uses an asymmetric (non-uniform) key partitioning to construct longer bicliques [27]. Actually, the non-isomorphic biclique attack, gives more degrees of freedom in selecting two sets of key differences Δ
                     
                        K
                      and ∇
                        K
                     . So, according to the key schedule and the diffusion layer properties of a block cipher, we can choose these key difference sets in a way which leads to the longer bicliques (as well as less data complexity).

An asymmetric key partitioning is done according to these difference sets. As a result, we obtain isomorphic groups of bicliques, each of them called a biclique group, while each biclique group consists of several non-isomorphic bicliques (bicliques with different dimensions). Indeed, non-isomorphic biclique cryptanalysis offers a multi-level partitioning, in this case including two levels of partitioning. In the first level, the whole of key space is partitioned between the biclique groups uniformly and in the second level, according to the asymmetric key partitioning, the key space belongs to each biclique group is partitioned non-uniformly.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief description of Crypton and its key schedule. Two non-isomorphic biclique attacks on full-round Crypton, one based on 4-round bicliques and the other based on 5-round bicliques, are introduced in Section 3. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 4.

Crypton is a 128-bit block cipher which supports key sizes up to 256bits. Crypton processes 128-bit data block, consisting of sixteen bytes. Each data block is represented as a double indexed or an equivalent single indexed matrix as follows:

                     where, dec2bin(j) corresponds to the 8-bit binary representation of decimal value j. As it can be seen, except 8 bits of ΔE[5] indexed by 0,1,…,7 which take all of their 256 possible values, the other bits of ∇
                        K
                      are always zero.

Depending on which of the four bytes are active (non-zero) in the output of π
                     
                        e,1
                     −1, there are four 4-round ∆-differential trails in the initial rounds of Crypton. Fig. 1
                      shows 4-round ∆-differential and ∇-differential trails based on key difference sets Δ
                     
                        K
                     , for those a
                     
                        i
                     s which π
                     
                        e,1
                     −1(a
                     
                        i
                     
                     ≪16)=[t,0,0,0], and ∇
                        K
                     , respectively. As it can be seen, these two differential trails share no active S-boxes. Hence, 4-round bicliques can be constructed according to Δ
                     
                        K
                      and ∇
                        K
                     . It can be easily checked that another three ∆-differential trails (for those a
                     
                        i
                     s which π
                     
                        e,1
                     −1(a
                     
                        i
                     
                     ≪16)=[0,
                     t,0,0] or [0,0,
                     t,0] or [0,0,0,
                     t]), also share no active S-boxes with the ∇-differential trail. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the ∆-differential has four active bytes in column 0 of Δx
                     1
                     
                        γ
                     . Thus, considering 1020 non-zero differences of ΔK
                     0, there are at most 1020×24×8
                     ≈242 possible non-zero plaintext differences. For the other three ∆-differential trails, we have the same number of active bytes, but in the different columns of Δx
                     1
                     
                        γ
                     . Consequently there are at most 244 possible non-zero plaintext differences.

In the non-isomorphic biclique cryptanalysis of Crypton, according to the defined sets of key differences Δ
                           
                              K
                            and ∇
                              K
                           , we use an asymmetric key partitioning technique. The concept of this technique is based on a minimal space generator. Assume the space S corresponds to a set of all 2
                              m
                            binary vectors of length m, and D is a given subset of S. For such a space S we define the minimal space generator G
                           
                              D
                            as a minimal subset of S, which for each element S

For this purpose, we keep their original values in 40bits number [64,…,95,160,…,167] and the other 216bits are set to zero. Also, for the estimation of the attacks complexity, any S-box operation is considered as a single memory access. Thus, a full-round encryption of Crypton is equivalent to 12×16=192 memory accesses.

                           . Thus, the time complexity of the proposed attack for each biclique group is at most equivalent to 238.03

                           ≈238.03 full-round encryptions. Consequently, the overall time complexity of the proposed attack is about 2216

                           ≈2254 full-round encryptions. As it was mentioned before, there are at most 244 possible non-zero plaintext differences in the input of 4-round bicliques. Thus, according to the fixed initial plaintext value P
                           0
                           =0, the data complexity of the proposed attack is also 244 chosen plaintexts.

The length of bicliques can be expanded to 5-rounds using the following key differences sets:

                        Fig. 3
                         shows that 5-round ∇-differential and ∆-differential trails based on ∇
                           K
                         and Δ

                        , share no active S-boxes, so 5-round bicliques can be constructed based on them.

According to the ∆-differential trail in Fig. 3, it seems that any plaintext difference can be occurred in the input of differential trail. However, it can be proved that there are plaintext differences that are impossible to occur in that position. For this purpose, first we must consider this fact that for each non-zero difference in the input of a S-box of Crypton, there are only 27
                        −1=127 possible differences in its output. As can be seen in Fig. 3, there are only 255 possible non-zero differences in columns 0, 1 and 3 of Δx
                        1
                        
                           π
                        . Also, π-transformation is linear, thus after the application of π
                        −1 we have the same number of possible differences in the same columns of Δx
                        1
                        
                           γ
                        . Hence, for each of 255 possible non-zero values in one of these three columns of Δx
                        1
                        
                           γ
                        , after the application of γ
                        −1 there are at most 1274 possible differences in the same columns of Δx
                        1

                        −28.2)3 which is slightly less than the entire of codebook. We have the same number of possible plaintext differences, because round-key ΔK
                        0 is zero. Same as the previous attack, the number of possible plaintext differences reveals the data complexity of the attack.

The attack proposed in the previous section can be easily extended to use these 5-round bicliques with a similar procedure. Assuming two matching bytes x
                        7,[11,15]
                        
                           σ
                        , it is easy to check that for each pair (i,
                        j) we need the re-computations of 33 S-boxes to check the equality for matching byte x
                        7,[11]
                        
                           σ
                        . If the equality is satisfied for the first matching byte, then we need the re-computations of additional 4 S-boxes to check the equality for matching byte x
                        7,[15]

                        . Thus the complexity of re-computations, as the dominant part of time complexity (same as the previous attack), is about

                         full-round encryptions for each biclique group. Consequently, the overall time complexity of the attack is about 2216

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Two cryptanalytic attacks on full-round Crypton were proposed in this paper. For this purpose we used an extension of the original biclique attack, called non-isomorphic biclique attack, to obtain longer bicliques of Crypton. The first attack, using 4-round independent bicliques, requires 244 chosen plaintexts and about 2254 full-round encryptions to mount. For the second attack, which uses 5-round bicliques, data complexity increases to 232
                     ×(232
                     −28.2)3 while its time complexity decreases to about 2253.46 full-round encryptions. As it is obvious, these attacks can be exploited to the other reduced-round versions of Crypton. For example, assume eight rounds of Crypton with a final transformation τ
                     ∘
                     π
                     
                        e
                     
                     ∘
                     τ (like the full-round cipher). To mount an attack on this reduced-round version of Crypton, it's enough to use the key difference sets Δ
                     
                        k
                      and ∇
                        K
                     , same as ones used for the second attack. So, assuming the three matching bytes x
                     6,[1,2,3]
                     
                        σ
                     , it is needed to re-compute the value of only one S-box, corresponds to byte x

                        γ
                     . Thus, the time complexity of the re-computations, as the dominant part of the attack complexity, is equivalent to about 2216
                     ×(240
                     ×(2−7
                     +2−24))≈2249 8-round encryptions (note that each 8-round encryption corresponds to 8×16=128 memory accesses). Also, the key difference sets Δ
                     
                        k
                      and ∇
                        K
                      of the first attack are used to mount an attack on 8-round Crypton. For this purpose, three bytes x
                     5,[0,1,2]
                     
                        σ
                      are assumed as matching bytes. Actually, 7bytes x

                        γ
                      must recomputed to obtain the value of matching nibbles. However, the matching bytes can be checked one by one. So, first we recompute three bytes x

                     . If the equality is achieved (with probability 2−8), then we need to recompute another two bytes x

                     . If both of the previous equalities are achieved (with probability 2−16), then the remaining two bytes must be recomputed to check the equality for the last matching byte. Hence, the time complexity of the attack is about 2216

According to the smaller length of bicliques, it was expected that the second attack on eight rounds of Crypton has a greater time complexity, however this attack needs smaller amount of chosen plaintexts to be mounted.
