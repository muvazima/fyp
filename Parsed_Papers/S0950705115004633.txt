                  The stochastic process is one the most important tools to overcome uncertainties of supply chain problems. Being a lack of studies on constrained reliable facility location problems (RFLP) with multiple capacity levels, this paper develops a bi-objective RFLP with multiple capacity levels in a three echelon supply chain management while there is a constraint on the coverage levels. Moreover, there is a provider-side uncertainty for distribution-centers (DCs). The aim of this paper is to find a near-optimal solution including suitable locations of DCs and plants, the fraction of satisfied customer demands, and the fraction of items sent to DCs to minimize the total cost and to maximize fill rate, simultaneously. As the proposed model belongs to NP-Hard problems, a meta-heuristic algorithm called multi-objective biogeography-based optimization (MOBBO) is employed to find a near-optimal Pareto solution. Since there is no benchmark in the literature to compare provided solutions, a non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA) and a multi objective simulated annealing (MOSA) are used to verify the solution obtained by MOBBO while a two-stage stochastic programming (2-SSP) is employed to capture randomness of DCs. This paper uses the adapted concepts of expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the value of stochastic solution (VSS) in order to validate 2-SSP. Moreover, the parameters of algorithms are tuned by the response surface methodology (RSM) in the design of experiments. Besides, an exact method, called branch-and-bound method via GAMS optimization software, is used to compare lower and upper bounds of Pareto fronts to optimize two single-objective problems separately.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Nowadays, supply chain management (SCM) plays an important role in the organizational survival. SCM encompasses all aspects of producing, distributing and delivering products regarding minimizing total costs and maximizing service level [1]. This requires meticulous planning, often exposed to uncertain events. The unreliability of facilities, like natural disasters, sabotage, and labor actions, causes provider-side uncertainty [2]. It might be possible for facilities in an SCM like distribution centers (DCs) to be inactive once in a while; thus, it is necessary to reassign customers to other active DCs while some real models are unable to do reassigning because of constraints on capacity and budget. A well-known approach to overcome this problem is called reliable facility location problem (RFLP), managing parts of a system when there is a failure in its parts [3]. Moreover, RFLP addresses the prospect of facilities' failure and seeks to minimize the expected failure cost. In general, RFLP includes three main sub-problems which are a stochastic programming, a supply chain design, and a facility location problem.

In the stochastic programming, one of the most popular approaches used in RFLP is a two-stage stochastic programming (2-SSP), successfully employed by these studies Shen et al. [2], Gade and Pohl [4], Aydin and Murat [5], and Marufuzzaman et al. [6]. In 2-SSP approach, decision variables of a problem are categorized into the first and the second stage variables. The first and the second variables are determined before and after an uncertain event, respectively. The 2-SSP uses scenarios for characterizing uncertainties. In the terminology of RFLP, the first and second stage decisions are representatives of location and allocation dependent variables, respectively. Moreover, scenarios represent different permutations of active and inactive facilities. Thus, the first stage variables are strategic decisions that are robust and unable to be revised. The second stage variables are tactical decisions that are flexible in response to any scenario realization. Since the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the value of stochastic solution (VSS) estimate uncertain parameters of a problem, it is a standard practice in stochastic literature to evaluate the effectiveness of 2-SSP by EVPI and VSS [7]. EVPI estimates the uncertain parameters using the factual information while VSS uses the expected value of uncertain parameters to estimate the uncertain parameters. In addition to stochastic programming, there are also several approaches to capture uncertainty such as hierarchical assignment of customers to the closet active DCs, continuum approximation, robust optimization, and Voronoi diagram. Billhardt et al. [8] presented a dynamic model to minimize expected arrival time to patients with respect to ambulance fleet allocation, in which a geometric optimization, called centroidal Voronoi tessellations, was used to capture uncertainty of the emergency services.

The supply chain design, the second component of RFLP, often involves conflicting objectives to fulfill both efficiency and responsiveness of the chain [9]. Thus, it is necessary to formulate problems into multi objective models to satisfy conflicting objectives, simultaneously. Altiparmak et al. [10] solved a tri-objective model in a supply chain using a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize total cost and capacity utilization rate of facilities and to maximize service level at the same time. Moreover, Moncayo-Martínez and Zhang [11] considered a supply chain including multiple suppliers in order to minimize total cost and lead-times simultaneously using multi objective colony optimization algorithm. Besides, Latha Shankar et al. [12] provided a near-optimal Pareto solution, minimizing total cost and maximizing fill rate, using multi-objective hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm in a single-product supply chain.

Facility location problem is the third and the main part of RFLP. Cases in which RFLP includes only location-allocation variables are unable to cover all aspects of real-world conditions such as capacity level variable [14]; thus, it seems reasonable to consider the capacity level of facilities endogenously [13]. Regarding the coverage constrain on facilities as the fundamental limitation, Li and Ouyang [14] developed a reliable fixed charge location problem with a facilities constraint to minimize expected customer transportation costs and the sum of initial facility construction costs in which there was a constraint on facilities coverage. Furthermore, Li and Ouyang [15] solved a RFLP, including traffic surveillance, using customized greedy and Lagrangian relaxation algorithms in which facilities and customers were assumed to be sensors and automobiles, respectively. In two previous studies, it is assumed that a facility serves a customer only within a given distance while the partial coverage constraint, as a new approach to overcoming uncertainties, is able to limit shipments from facilities to customers based on both their distance [16] and capacity level of facilities [17]. Thus, this paper employs this approach to near to real-world conditions.

This paper developed a bi-objective RFLP in a three-echelon SCM including plants, DCs, and customers in which DCs include probabilistic failure with a determined distribution while a set of scenarios is used to present different permutations of active and inactive DCs. Moreover, 2-SSP is adopted to capture the randomness of DCs while VSS and EVPI are used in order to validate 2-SSP. It is assumed that multi levels of capacities are available for both plants and DCs. The aim of this paper is to find a near-optimal Pareto solution including capacity level of facilities and typical location-allocation decisions to minimize total cost (expected transportation costs) and to maximize fill rate (the expected cumulative amount of satisfied customers' demand within all scenarios), simultaneously while there is a constraint on shipments from DCs to customers based on both their distance and capacity level of DCs called the partial coverage constraint. Appendix including a basic instance provides more details to improve understanding of the proposed model.

As RFLP is an NP-hard problem, proved by Peng et al. [18], it is impossible or hard to solve it with an exact method in a reasonable time. Thus, meta-heuristic optimizations, like genetic algorithm (GA) [19], are used to solve NP-hard problem such as Salimi [20] and Farahani and Elahipanah [21]. There are two approaches to solve multi objective models: classical and Pareto front [22]. The main advantage of using Pareto front is to provide a set of solutions based on objectives in which decision makers are able to present a solution with respect to the importance of objectives. Thus, the Pareto optimizations in evolutionary algorithms have been used to solve the multi objective problems such as multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) [12], Ant-colony algorithm [11], Bees algorithm [23], and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) [24].

Since the proposed model is both an NP-hard problem and a multi-objective model, this paper employs the meta-heuristic algorithms to solve it. This paper uses multi-objective biogeography-based optimization (MOBBO) to provide a near-optimal Pareto solution verified by two other algorithms namely the multi objective simulated annealing (MOSA) and the non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA) while response surface methodology (RSM) tunes parameters of the algorithms.

The most important practical applications of Reliable Facility Location Problem (RFLP) are in inclement weather, labor actions, sabotage, change in ownership, terroristic attacks, and disaster management. This paper like other studies tries to develop RFLPs to close to real-world conditions. Therefore, in comparison to recent studies shown in Table 1
                     , the main contribution of this paper is to develop the mathematical model based on the suggestion made by Cui et al. [25], i.e. multi-level capacities, in which the model itself optimizes and defines the capacity of facilities (endogenously in the terminology of RFLP) rather than defining it by an assumption made in the model (exogenously in the terminology of RFLP). Another expansion of this paper is to consider the partial coverage as a constraint on the model. The simple coverage constraint, studied by Li and Ouyang [14], Li and Ouyang [15] and O'Hanley and Church [26], covers customers located in defined regions while the partial coverage supports customers based on the proportion of distance to capacity level of facilities. Another contribution is to formulate two conflict objectives into a bi-objective RFLP based on suggestion made by Cardona-Valdés et al. [9] optimizing the efficiency (e.g. total cost) and responsiveness (e.g. fill rate) factors, simultaneously. Finally, this research is probably the first study employing EVPI and VSS for multi-objective models.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents mathematical model. The solution procedures and the results are shown in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Finally, conclusion and the future research are provided in Section 5.

This section formulates the 2-SSP and its extension for the a bi-objective concept of a partial reliable facility location problem (BPRCFLP). As a result of utilizing the 2-SSP, different decisions are made in two stages. First stage decisions determine the location and capacity level of opened DCs and plants. Second stage decisions determine the supply and distribution patterns of the chain. This involves supplying the opened and active DCs by the opened plants and then servicing. During the second stage, some of the opened DCs of the first stage may be inactive due to the realization of a specific uncertainty. Inactive DCs have zero capacity and consequently supply and distribution patterns should be made with respect to the active DCs. A scenario is an event which realizes the active and inactive DCs beyond an uncertainty. Since the outcome of an uncertainty is not clear, a set of scenarios is considered to enumerate all the events. The second stage is referred to as recourse decision. Actually, when one or more DCs is/are inactive, other active DCs should satisfy the demand. However, this may not be fully accomplished due to the capacity constraint of DCs. Since the first stage decisions are irreversible, the only legal recourse to mitigate the situation is the second stage of decision making. Here, we formulate a trade-off between costs associated with the first and second stage decisions on one hand and fill rate of customers’ demand on the other hand. To customize a bi-objectives 2-SSP for BPRCFLP, notations are suggested as follows.

In BPRCFLP model, the first objective function, Eq. (1), is the minimization of the both fixed location and the expected transportation costs. Indeed, the first two terms of Eq. (1) represent costs related to the first stage decisions while the third is associated with recourse decisions. The second objective function, Eq. (2), maximizes demands coverage for all possible scenarios. According to Eq. (3) extra demand allocation for customers are avoided. Eq. (4) controls the fraction of allocation to customers with regard to opening, working and covering status of DCs. Eq. (5) prevents from opening a DC which cannot cover any customer. Concerning DCs, extra delivery with respect to received amount is not permitted by Eq. (6). Eq. (7) prevents from assigning potential plants to a DC as long as it has not been opened. Eq. (8) limits shipment of commodities to DCs in terms of plants capacities. Eqs. (9) and (10) prevent from considering multiple capacity level for plants and DCs, respectively. Finally, Eqs. (11)–(14) give the status of decision of variables.

In this section, a solution representation for BPRCFLP is initially suggested; then, the procedure of alignment of NRGA, MOSA and MOBBO with BPRCFLP are described.

Solutions to BPRCFLP are composed of four individual chromosomes representing the four types of decision variables. Precisely, a four-segmented chromosome is randomly drawn from (0, 1) interval and is assigned to the first scenario as in Fig. 1. The four-segmented chromosome of the first scenario is denoted as a mask chromosome. To deal with other scenarios, we replicate the mask chromosome, but arrays related to the inactive DCs of corresponding scenario are converted into zero (for better understanding, refer to numerical example of this subsection). A penalty function and a decoding procedure are applied in order to ensure the feasibility of the solution representation. Accordingly, we penalize the violation of Eqs. (6) and (8) using method of Yeniay [27]. For the rest of constraints, the decoding procedure of Fig. 2 is illustrated.

To illustrate a clear understanding of the solution representation and its decoding procedure, a numerical example is given in Fig. 3
                        . This includes an SC structure including four customers, three DCs and two plants alongside with a specific mask chromosome. There are two capacity levels for both plants and DCs. Further, it contains two scenarios. In the first (i.e. normal) scenario, all DCs are active (i.e. F1
                         = ø). In the second (i.e. failure) scenario, DCs with indices 2 and 3 are inactive (i.e. F2
                         = [2, 3]). Fig. 4
                         indicates a schematic location-allocation solution with respect to these normal and failure scenarios.

The evolutionary mechanism of NRGA initializes with generating a number of random solutions according to the population size (npop). Based on the pre-defined iteration number (MaxIt), it enters to the main loop. In each iteration, the obtained population is sorted via non-dominated sorting approach and scored through crowding distance factor [28]. Subsequently, ranked based roulette wheel selection for supplying qualified candidate solutions to crossover and mutation processes is performed as given by Al Jadaan et al. [29]. In accordance with the pre-defined rate of crossover (pc
                        ) and mutation (pm
                        ), new solutions of these operators are aggregated into the population as in Figs. 5
                         and 6
                        . Now, whole population is being sorted again by the non-dominated sorting method and consequently scored by crowding distance. Finally, at the end of each loop, the firstnpopnumbers of the population are selected for the next generation of the new iteration.

Actually, MOSA is an iterative process to achieve a desirable population-based Pareto-set. Occasionally, different extensions of MOSA are similar in terms of sorting and scoring Pareto solutions per iteration as well as NRGA. However, differences stem from diverse application of cooling schedule, neighborhood structure and acceptance probability of dominated solutions. In the proposed MOSA, we use the logspace function of MATLAB software to iteratively decrease the initial temperature (T0
                        ) to the final temperature (Tf
                        ). The adopted neighborhood structure is exactly likewise the mutation operator of NRGA. Moreover, the acceptance probability of dominated solutions is applied by means of Ulungu, et al. [30] approach.

The biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is one of the state-of-arts of evolutionary algorithms. The RFLP can be modeled through the Markov process. As a result, MOBBO seems an apt algorithm to solve BPRCFLP.

In fact, BBO uses the migration strategy of species from one habitat to the better one in order to improve their chances of survival [31]. Virtually, a better habitat is more suitable in terms of abundance of food, especially for rearing young and biological diversity. In BBO, habitat (H) and habitat suitability index (HSI) play roles as the chromosome and fitness function of an optimization problem. This optimization problem also looks for better solutions with higher HSI by applying migration and mutation operators. Using Pareto-based tools such as non-dominated sorting (NDS) algorithm and crowding distance (CD), the multi-objective BBO is obtained.


                        Fig. 7
                         concisely reviews the skeleton of MOBBO. In this algorithm, habitats with higher HSI host more species than habitats with lower HSI. This means that higher HSI habitats are saturated. Thus, the immigration rate of species (λ) to habitats with high HSI decreases while the emigration rate (µ) from these habitats increased. Accordingly, HSI is a crucial factor in determining λ and µ. However, the abundance of species in a habitat varies over the time. In this regard, the probability of existing S species in a habitat (PS
                        ) is another critical parameter of MOBBO. PS
                         is mapped into the probability of existing a specific solution denoted as Pi
                         
                        [32].

Two main operators of MOBBO are migration and mutation. Migration operator is done just like the crossover of NRGA. The two required solutions of crossover are the destination and origin habitats that are selected with respect to λ and µ, respectively. Mutation operator of MOBBO is the same as mutation operator of NRGA (neighborhood structure of MOSA). Note that, the mutation probability of MOBBO (mi
                        ) determines whether a specific solution (habitat) is likely to be mutated.

This section addresses the issues of evaluating accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms on a series of instances. In Section 4.1, a random but systematic procedure for generating problem instances is discussed. Pareto-based evaluation criteria are enumerated in Section 4.2. Section 4.3 defines how conventional stochastic measures are adapted to the multi-objective problems. Section 4.4 declares optimal values of algorithms' initialization phase. To sum up, logical, statistical and operational research results are given in Section 4.5. We have conducted our work through MATLAB (version 2014a) programming on a PC with 2-GB RAM and 2.4-GHz CPU under Win 7.

Since test problems of previous studies are not a perfect benchmark for BPRCFLP, we design the subsequent procedure for generating hypothetical instances. The number of customers is on a scale from 10 to 110. The same amount of DCs and plants are 3 up to 22 and 2 up to 10, respectively. Among these sizes, the number of DCs is more critical due to the involvement of scenarios. Totally, we generate a total number of thirty instances. In this regard, twenty instances correspond to the one by one increment of the number of DCs from 3 to 22. The number of DCs is also kept fixed at specific levels during the other ten instances. Totally, these thirty instances are merged and shown in ascending order of the number of customers.

Customers' demand obeys a uniform distribution between 100 and 1000 while coordinates of customers and facilities are uniformly drawn between 0 and 100. Note that the other distribution functions are usually out of the scope of the discrete location problems such as our study [33]. Furthermore, three capacity levels are considered for both plants and DCs. A random allocation of two times the entire demand is regarded as the amount of capacity. We assume that there is a positive direct relationship between fixed cost of a DC (
                           
                              F
                              j
                              r
                           
                        ) and its capacity (
                           
                              b
                              j
                              r
                           
                        ). To do so, a second order equation of relation (27) is constructed. The first (α0
                        ) and second (α1
                        ) coefficients are set as 10,000 and 50, respectively. Now, consider the extremum point (EP) of this equation (
                           
                              i

                                 1
                              
                              /
                              2
                              
                                 α

                        ). To preserve the positive direct relationship, EP is valued a bit more than the maximum amount of capacity of DCs (
                           
                              i

                              =

                                 j
                              
                              
                                 {

                        ). As a result, the third constant coefficient (α2
                        ) can be determined (
                           
                              i
                              
                                 .

                              .
                              
                              
                              −
                              50
                              /
                              2
                              E
                              P
                           
                        ). Similarly, we have relation (28) to generate fixed cost of a plant (
                           
                              G
                              k
                              h
                           
                        ) based on the capacity (
                           
                              e
                              k
                              h
                           
                        ). Since opening a plant seems more costly than a DC, the constant coefficients of relation (28) are five times greater than relation (27). Thus, we have β0 = 5α0, β1 = 5α1
                         and β2 = 5α2
                        . For the sake of generating the transportation cost, let

                                    ∑
                                    k
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       ∑

                         represent production cost. Then, the transportation cost between plants and DCs (DCs and customers) is the product of Euclidian distance times 1% (0.5%) of the production cost. The failure probability of DCs is also equal to 0.02. Finally, we define coverage ratio on the basis of relation (29). Indeed, we alter linear coverage function of Lee and Lee [16] through involving of the capacity level (r). As the number of capacity level increases, the lower (
                           
                              s
                              d

                        ) and upper (

                        ) bounds of coverage function are expanded. Consequently, DCs can cover farther customers regarding to
                         Euclidean distance (dij
                        ).

In the multi-objective problems, different evaluation criteria are applied to assess the quality of a Pareto-based solution (see Table 2). In this manner, diversity (D), spacing (S) of Deb [34], mean ideal distance (MID) of Karimi, et al. [35], and CPU time are used for comparing proposed algorithms (Henceforth, these criteria are denoted as interactive criteria). In addition, the final number of non-dominated solutions (FNS), introduced by Rahmati et al. [36], is considered for estimating stochastic measures (see Fig. 8
                        ). Lastly, Pareto-solutions of both algorithms are separately compared with output solution of GAMS optimization software. This comparison, entitled as %Error or GAMS criterion, is made through inserting the value of second-objective function of each Pareto-solution as a new constraint into the model [21].

The proposed model of this paper is a stochastic programming because it involves the random parameter of DCs' capacity. This parameter is random since a DC may be active (with nominal capacity) or inactive (with zero capacity) depending on a specific scenario. BPRCFLP employs 2-SSP to capture randomness. 2-SSP considers all scenarios to predict random parameter, since we are not aware of the future. Normally, EVPI and VSS justify effectiveness of 2-SSP versus less cumbersome alternatives. Meanwhile, these measures used to be applied in the single-objective oriented problems. Therefore, we do adapt stochastic measures for the bi-objective purpose of current study (see Fig. 9
                        ).

One extreme alternative, denoted as PI, is to only consider one scenario since we have the perfect information about the future. EVPI measures to what degree a solution of PI is better than a resulted solution of 2-SSP. Fig. 9(a) shows an adapted form of EVPI where BPRCFLP(t) is a single scenario version of BPRCFLP with regards to scenario t. Accordingly, EVPI corresponds to the relative increase in the number of non-dominated solutions as a result of using PI instead of 2-SSP.
                        
                     

Now, consider a scenario, denoted as SD, with semi-active DCs. In the other words, SD corresponds to a scenario where all DCs are active but operating with 50% of their nominal capacity (

                        ). Another alternative, denoted as ES, is to only consider the scenario of SD. VSS assesses how much a solution of 2-SSP is better than a solution of ES. In Fig. 9(b), BPRCFLP(t,T) is a specific version of BPRCFLP with regards to scenario t and a predetermined first stage solution of T. Thus, a multi-objective variant of VSS is relative increase in FNS due to considering 2-SSP instead of ES.

We use response surface methodology (RSM) in order to tune the key parameters of the solution algorithms. RSM deals with problems, whose output (response) involve different variables (i.e. initialization parameters) and tries to optimize the responses (i.e. interactive criteria) using a combination of statistical and mathematical approaches [37]. The optimal values of initialization parameters related to NRGA, MOSA and MOBBO are shown in Table 3.
                     

As it is clear from Table 4, the average of diversity metric of MOBBO is higher than the counterpart values of NRGA and MOSA. This can also be supported by statistical results of Table 5 and Box-plot of Fig. 10. Fig. 11
                         clarifies the difference of diversity index in which NRGA and MOSA often fall behind the relatively monotonous trend of MOBBO. Similarly, we conclude better performance of MOBBO in terms of the S and MID criteria.

Based on the average result of Table 4, MOSA has a lower computational time (545.9 s) than MOBBO (556.6 s) and NRGA (1052.4 s). Nevertheless, the content of Table 5 advocates the null hypothesis on equity of means (with p-Value of 0.203). As a result, there is no significant difference between NRGA, MOSA and MOBBO concerning CPU time.

Moreover, Table 6
                        
                         demonstrates experimental results on the stochastic measures via the FNS criterion in terms of three different instances. For example, consider the second instance on EVPI. Regarding two different alternatives to solve BPRCFLP, PI dominates 34 numbers of 2-SSP's solutions. At the same time, 6 solutions of PI would be dominated by 2-SSP. In summary, EVPI and VSS turned to be 36% and 68%, respectively. Besides that, we can justify relation (30) through monitoring Fig. 12
                         (A≺B means that B dominates A). Therefore, our strategy to model BPRCFLP through 2-SSP is plausible since for real world applications a situation with perfect information about the future seems infeasible.

The experiment of Table 7 focuses on the 10 solutions of two different instances and conveys different issues. First, the performances of the proposed algorithms are in close proximity to the GAMS solutions in terms of small-sized instances. This indicates the adequacy of the proposed solution methodologies for large-sized instances. Second, the average result advocates the superiority of MOBBO based on GAMS criterion. Finally, the GAMS criterion decreases as the problem size increases.

This paper developed a bi-objective reliable capacitated facility location problem in a three-echelon supply chain including plants, DCs, and customers in which DCs included probabilistic failure with a determined distribution while a set of scenarios employed to present different permutations of the active and the inactive DCs. Moreover, 2-SSP was adopted to capture randomness of DCs while VSS and EVPI were used in order to validate 2-SSP. Moreover, there was a constraint on shipments from DCs to customers based on both their distance and capacity level of DCs called the partial coverage constraint. The goal of this paper was to find a near-optimal Pareto solution to minimize total cost (expected transportation costs) and to maximize fill rate (the expected cumulative amount of satisfied customers' demand within all scenarios), simultaneously. Since the proposed bi-objective model was an NP-Hard problem, a multi-objective biogeography-based optimization (MOBBO) including a four-segmented solution candidate was used to find a near-optimal Pareto solution. The non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA) and the multi objective simulated annealing (MOSA) were used to verify the solution provided by MOBBO. The response surface methodology (RSM) calibrates the parameters of algorithms. The results showed that the better performance of MOBBO in terms of the divergence and convergence of Pareto solutions. Nevertheless, superior performance in terms of CPU time was statistically inconclusive. Computational results also demonstrated that we could trust the proposed 2-SSP and algorithms due to the significant value of adapted VSS and negligible amount of the GAMS criterion, respectively.

The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, the main innovation is to formulate problem regarding assumptions which are to consider the second objective called fill-rate, to consider capacity levels as variables, and to develop the coverage constraint based on distance and capacity level of facilities. Second, this paper is probably the first study that adapts EVPI and VSS for multi-objective models. Finally, employing multi-objective biogeography-based optimization (MOBBO) tuned by the response surface methodology (RSM) is a contribution in solution algorithms used in RFLP.

The research can be developed for several aspects as follows.

To improve understanding of the model formulation and its complexity, consider the basic instance of Fig. A.1 There are two potential distribution centers (DCs) and one plant for satisfying 100 unit of demands of customer i. The distance between facilities and customers and failure probability of DCs are inserted in Fig. A.1(a). All facilities have two levels of capacities. The capacities of DC1 at the first and the second level are 80 and 120, respectively. In the same vein for DC2, the first level of capacity is 60 and the second level is 90. In terms of the plant, the first and second levels have a capacity of 80 and 200, respectively. Fixed costs of facilities with first and second levels of capacities are 1000 and 1500, respectively. Due to the coverage constraint, DC1 can cover 50% and 70% of customer's demand at the first and the second levels of capacity, respectively. Similarly, DC2 is able to cover 80% of customer’ demand at the first level of capacity and 100% at the second one. Further, this instance has three scenarios with corresponding probability of occurrence as depicted in Fig. A.1(b).
                     
                  

To find a set of best Pareto solutions of the basic instance, we use a simple enumeration and then depict the Pareto fronts. Table A.1 shows the resulting objective functions. Furthermore, different states of opening the plant and DCs at corresponding levels of capacities are also recorded in Table A.1. For instance, consider the first row of Table A.1. Opening the plant and DC1 at their first level of capacity can cover 45% of demands cumulatively while can incur a total cost of 3350. Precisely, 1000 is the contribution of fixed cost for facilities. Shipments among customer, DC and plant are made with respect to the demand, capacity of facilities and coverage constraint. Since DC1 is able to cover only 50% of demand at the first level of capacity, the shipment from DC1 to customer is 50. To keep the balance, the shipment from plant to DC1 is also 50. The product of the shipment by the distance is 1500 (e.g. 50 × 20 + 50 × 10). Accordingly, the transportation cost is 1500 in the first and second scenarios with the probability of 0.72 and 0.18, respectively. However, the transportation cost of the third scenario is zero owing to the fact that DC1 is inactive within it. In the same vein, Fill rate is computed according to each scenario. The fractions of satisfied demand in the first and second scenario are 50% with corresponding probabilities. However, the structure fails to cover any demand regarding to third scenario. Regarding all resulting solutions of Table A.1, the decision maker should consider first Pareto front of solutions (see Fig. A.2).
