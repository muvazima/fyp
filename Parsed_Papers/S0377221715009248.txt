                  Traditionally, both researchers and practitioners rely on standard Erlang queueing models to analyze call center operations. Going beyond such simple models has strong implications, as is evidenced by theoretical advances in the recent literature. However, there is very little empirical research to support that body of theoretical work. In this paper, we carry out a large-scale data-based investigation of service times in a call center with many heterogeneous agents and multiple call types. We observe that, for a given call type: (a) the service-time distribution depends strongly on the individual agent, (b) that it changes with time, and (c) that average service times are correlated across successive days or weeks. We develop stochastic models that account for these facts. We compare our models to simpler ones, commonly used in practice, and find that our proposed models have a better goodness-of-fit, both in-sample and out-of-sample. We also perform simulation experiments to show that the choice of model can have a significant impact on the estimates of common measures of quality of service in the call center.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The effective management of call centers is a challenging task mainly because managers are consistently facing considerable uncertainty; see Gans, Koole, and Mandelbaum (2003) and Aksin, Armony, and Mehrotra (2007) for background on call centers. Among important sources of uncertainty are call arrival rates which are typically both time-varying and stochastic, service times which are random and whose distribution may depend on the call type and the agent who handles it, and agents who may not show up or may not follow their planned schedules; see Bhulai and Koole (2003), Avramidis, Deslauriers, and L’Ecuyer (2004), Avramidis and L’Ecuyer (2005), Aldor-Noiman, Feigin, and Mandelbaum (2009), Gans, Liu, Mandelbaum, Shen, and Ye (2010), Ibrahim, L’Ecuyer, Régnard, and Shen (2012), Oreshkin, L’Ecuyer, and Régnard (2015), and references therein.

In this paper, we focus on the effective modelling of service times in call centers. In particular, we carry out a large-scale, in-depth, empirical investigation of service times in call centers. We analyze data gathered at the call center of Hydro-Québec (HQ), which is a government-owned public utility overseeing the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity for the province of Quebec, in Canada. This real call center setting is complex, consisting of many heterogeneous agents and multiple distinct call types. Our data show that service times differ greatly across such agents, vary in time, and exhibit strong serial and cross correlations. We propose new service-time models which account for those features, and which are a good fit to real-life data, both in-sample and out-of-sample. We are interested in out-of-sample predictions because it is important to verify that our models are reliable tools to predict the future mean service times of agents, which have a considerable impact on future system performance.

Proposing new and more realistic service-time models, as we do in this paper, is important for the effective simulation of call centers. Simulation is an important tool that can be used to evaluate performance measures such as service levels and average waiting times, and to construct work schedules for agents and call routing rules by stochastic optimization algorithms (Avramidis, Chan, Gendreau, L’Ecuyer, & Pisacane, 2010; Chan, Koole, & L’Ecuyer, 2014). We use simulation to show that the choice of service-time model can have a significant impact on the performance measures in call centers, and formulate valuable insights on the practical usefulness of those findings.

Traditionally, both researchers and practitioners relied on standard Erlang queueing models to analyze call center operations. In Erlang queueing models, agent service times are modelled as independent and identically distributed exponential random variables with a constant mean. Going beyond this standard modelling assumption has important operational consequences, as is evidenced by multiple advances in the recent literature.

There is a stream of papers which studies queueing models with heterogeneous servers, with applications to call center management. One central question which arises in this context is how to route incoming calls to heterogeneous agents so as to minimize a given performance measure, such as the mean waiting time. Given the complexity of this problem, most papers resort to finding optimal routing policies in large-scale systems under heavy-traffic conditions; e.g., see Armony (2005), Gurvich and Whitt (2009), Armony and Ward (2010), Armony and Mandelbaum (2011), and references therein. Mehrotra, Ross, Ryder, and Zhou (2012) resort to a numerical study to characterize overall performance in terms of customer waiting time and overall resolution rate. In general, these papers show that control decisions can actually benefit from agent heterogeneity, e.g., routing incoming calls to the fastest idle agents reduces customer waiting.

There is very little empirical research supporting that body of theoretical work. To the best of our knowledge, the only exception is Gans et al. (2010) who analyzed call-center data and identified both short-term and long-term factors associated with agent heterogeneity in practice. They also described results from a small simulation study illustrating the operational consequences of ignoring such heterogeneity. (We revisit their example and extend some of their conclusions in Section 6.) Gans et al. indicated that an interesting extension of their paper is to incorporate random effects in service-time models so as to “capture within-agent dependence among the calls handled by the same agent, and enable understanding of a whole agent population” (p. 118). We consider such random-effects models in this paper. In general, random effects represent additional, unobservable and uncontrollable, variability which causes systematic deviations from the average performance of the agent, and due to which successive service times may be dependent. Dependencies between service times are often observed in data, and are therefore important to model, as we do in this paper.

Service times in practice are often dependent. For one example, an agent may be overworked in given periods (e.g., in weeks where congestion is higher than usual) and this could affect his/her performance in all services that s/he performs during such periods, typically resulting in that agent either slowing down or speeding-up; see Delasay, Ingolfsson, and Kolfal (2015), Dong, Feldman, and Yom-Tov (2015), Feldman, Li, Yom-Tov, and Yom-Tov (2015), and references therein. In this case, agents (servers) may be viewed as strategic decision makers that influence their own service rates. As a result of such strategic behavior, successive service times are dependent. For a second example, in a technical call center, there may be a product defect due to which there are multiple related calls, whose durations are all longer than average. In this example too, service times (call durations) are dependent.

There is a well-developed theory studying the performance impact of dependence among service times in single-server queues; e.g., see Chapter 9 of Whitt (2002) for a detailed treatment. However, Pang and Whitt (2012) are among the first to consider the multi-server case, which is more reasonable from a practical perspective. They considered a weakly dependent stationary sequence of service times and demonstrated that, in the heavy-traffic limit, the impact of those dependencies is determined by the bivariate cumulative distribution function of service times. In their numerical study, they considered an EARMA sequence of service times, which is stationary with exponential marginal distributions and the correlation structure of an autoregressive-moving average process. Pang and Whitt demonstrated, via theoretical analysis and computer simulation, how dependencies between service times can significantly alter large system performance. In particular, they showed that those correlations strongly impact the distribution of the number of customers in queue which, in turn, affects staffing decisions. Pang and Whitt concluded their paper by calling for “empirical studies to estimate the strength of dependence among service times in applications” (p. 278). We conduct such a study in this paper.

There are relatively few papers which consider queueing models with time-varying service rates, since this feature substantially complicates the analysis. Some exceptions include Mandelbaum, Massey, Reiman, and Stolyar (1999), Liu and Whitt (2011), and references therein. These papers demonstrate the operational impact of including time-varying service rates; their results apply generally and do not assume a specific form for time dependence in the service rate. Aldor-Noiman et al. (2009) used predictions of future arrival counts and mean service times to estimate future loads in call centers. Aldor-Noiman et al. allowed for mean service times to be time-dependent, and showed how errors in predicting future loads can impact staffing decisions. Their paper assumed homogeneous agents and a single call type. Our service-time models account for time dependence as well, albeit in a much more complex setting, with multiple call types and many heterogeneous agents.

In their seminal paper, Brown et al. (2005) performed a detailed statistical analysis of call center data and showed that service times are not exponentially distributed, as was traditionally assumed, and that the lognormal distribution is a remarkably good fit for the service-time distribution instead. Deslauriers (2003) had also observed the same thing. Motivated by this, Shen and Brown (2006) proposed a new method for inference about non-parametric regression curves when the errors are lognormally distributed, and illustrated their method with both a simulation study and the analysis of real-life call center data. Mandelbaum and Zeltyn (2010) advocated a process-view of service times which are modeled as the evolution of a finite-state continuous-time absorbing Markov process (phase-type distribution). Here, even though we use additional information when modelling service times, such as the time when the call is answered, we continue to assume the lognormality of the individual service times.

In this paper, we supplement the body of theoretical research above with supporting empirical work. As such, we take a step toward filling that gap in the literature. In addition to proposing new service-time models that are a good fit to data, we quantify the performance impact of our alternative service-time models through a simulation study.

Here is how the rest of this paper is organized. In Section 2, we describe and do a preliminary analysis of the data set that motivated this research. In Section 3, we describe our candidate models. In Section 4, we compare the in-sample goodness of fit of our models. In Section 5, we compare the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of our models for a large pool of agents. In Section 6, we present the results of simulation experiments which quantify the performance impact of our different models. In Section 7, we make concluding remarks. In the online supplement, we describe additional models which we considered, and present additional details and numerical results.

The present data were gathered at the call center of HQ. The call center is virtual with over 15 locations across Quebec. They were collected over the span of one year, ranging from January 3, 2011 to December 31, 2011. The call center is open on weekdays and closed on weekends (Saturday and Sunday). The data consist of daily averages of service times for alternative agents and different call types. Even though it is desirable to study call-by-call data, many call centers still routinely collect aggregate summary data instead; see Pinedo et al. (1999) and Oreshkin et al. (2015), for example. Therefore, it is important to develop service-time models whose parameters can be estimated with such aggregated data, as we do here. In addition to daily averages of service times, the data contain information about the daily number of calls handled by each agent, per call type. Call types are distinguished by both the nature of the service request and the language, either French or English, in which the call is handled.

A service time often consists of a first part handled by an interactive voice response (IVR) system, and a second part where the call is handled by an agent. Since we are interested in modelling service times from the viewpoint of agents, we do not consider the IVR part because agents are not involved for that part. The time spent by customers in the IVR is studied by Salcedo-Sanz, Naldi, Pérez-Bellido, Portilla-Figueras, and Ortíz-García (2010) and Colladon, Naldi, and Schiraldi (2013), for example. From the viewpoint of an agent (our viewpoint), an individual service time is the sum of: (i) the time spent actually talking to the customer (call time), and (ii) the post-call time spent by the agent to wrap up issues related to the call, during which s/he remains unavailable.

@&#OVERVIEW@&#

In our data set, there are 148 call types handled by a group of 1655 agents. Alternative agents have different skills and they handle different call types depending on those skills. In total, there are 16,328 distinct agent/call type combinations, where each combination corresponds to an agent handling a particular call type. Many call types have very few corresponding calls, and are not interesting for us to study. We remove from our data set all call types that have less than 10 calls in total, across all agents, and are left with 86 call types handled by a total of 1562 agents.

To sketch a temporal distribution of the workforce, we plot in Fig. 1 the average number of agents answering calls per weekday, with 95 percent confidence bands that correspond to the 2.5 percent and 97.5 percent empirical quantiles, based on agents who have handled at least 10 calls in the data. We see that that the number of agents is highly variable on Mondays, and that Fridays have the least number of agents, on average. In Fig. 2
                        , we plot the total average call volume per weekday, including all call types. Consistent with Fig. 1, Fig. 2 shows that call volumes on Mondays exhibit the highest variance, and that call volumes on Fridays are lowest on average.

Agents typically handle more than one call type on any given day; also, a single call type is typically handled by more than one agent. For example, roughly 400 agents handle from 1 to 3 distinct call types, and about 25 call types are handled by roughly 65 agents each. The median of the total number of call types handled per agent (over the one year period) is 13, and the median of the number of agents handling a given call type is 33.

We report several important empirical observations from our data. Our stochastic models for service times are developed to incorporate such features.


                           Fig. 3
                            gives a scatter plot of the empirical means versus variances of service times for different call types in our data. Each point in the plot corresponds to a given (mean, variance) pair, corresponding to a given call type. Fig. 3 shows that there are significant differences in means and variances across different call types. As expected, Fig. 3 shows that call types with longer durations generally exhibit higher variances. We take this variation between call types into account in Section 3.

Service time distributions for the same call type vary considerably depending on the agent. In Figs. 4
                            and 5
                           , we illustrate this agent heterogeneity. We plot average service times for two call types: A, which is handled by 991 agents, and B, which is handled by 997 agents, as a function of the total number of calls answered (over the one-year period covered by our data) by each agent.

The horizontal line in each figure indicates the overall average service time across all agents, for each call type. Figs. 4 and 5 show that there is significant variability in service times across all agents. Figs. 4 and 5 also show that there are clearly clusters of agents who seem to perform in a roughly similar manner (having either shorter or longer than average service times). In general, agents who have handled many calls during the year are much faster on average than those who have handled few calls. The latter are either agents who have handled very few calls in general, or ones who have mostly handled calls of other types. In general, it appears that agents who have handled more calls tend to exhibit less variance in their service times. In other words, the larger dispersion is mainly exhibited by less experienced agents (those answering fewer calls). In Figs. 6
                            and 7
                           , we plot estimates of the variances of service times for all agents handling type A and type B calls, respectively, as a function of the total number of calls of that type answered by the agent. Figs. 6 and 7 confirm that there are clear differences in variance of service times across agents.

In Fig. 8
                           , we plot the average service times for four agents handling calls of type B, as a function of time (index of day). Additionally, we include horizontal lines corresponding to the overall average service times for those agents. Fig. 8 illustrates that different agents exhibit different behavior. Indeed, the top two agents are evidently slower than the bottom two agents, and their service times also have higher variances.

In addition to variability across different agents, our data show that the average service time for a given agent and a given call type varies significantly over time.

In Fig. 9
                           , we plot the average daily service times for an agent handling four different call types, as a function of time. These daily averages clearly vary with time. Fig. 9 illustrates a phenomenon which could be important from an operational perspective: The agent seems to be slowing down as he/she handles more call types. Indeed, this is apparent starting day 208 when the agent begins handling calls of type 4. Thereafter, Fig. 9 shows that the average service times for call types 1 and 2 increase. Based on such observations, we experimented with including the number of call types handled by an agent as a covariate in our service-time models. We did not include such models in this paper because they lead to less accurate out-of-sample predictions of future expected service times on average over all agents in our data; see the online supplement for more details. Fig. 8 also illustrates that average service times fluctuate across successive days.

In Fig. 10
                           , we illustrate time dependence by plotting the evolution, over time, of the daily average service times for an agent a
                           1 handling type A calls. In Fig. 10, we also include the best linear fit for the data. This plotted line clearly shows an upward trend in the average service times for this agent. In our data, we observed both upward and downward trends, depending on the agent. One explanation for downward trends is that agents are learning with time; see Gans et al. (2010) for further empirical support. There may be many other explanations for such trends. For example, with upward trends, it may be that agents are getting bored and less motivated to answer calls quickly.

The total number of calls answered per agent varies widely across agents in our data. The maximum is 14,715 calls handled by one agent over the one year period, but hundreds of agents have answered very few calls. For these agents, it is difficult to fit service-time models and do reliable predictions. Moreover, with insufficient data it is hard to reach meaningful results. For the remainder of this paper, we restrict our attention to agents who answered a relatively large number of calls; specifically the 200 agents who answered the most calls during the year. These 200 agents answered a total of 1,175,178 calls, which corresponds to roughly half of the total number of calls incoming to the center during the year. For each one of these 200 agents, we removed (agent, call type) pairs where the agent handles the call type for less than a total of 10 days in our data set. We do this to avoid considering (agent, call type) pairs with too few observations.

There is a total of 550 different (agent, call type) pairs which remain in our cohort. In Tables 3–5
                        
                        
                         of the supplement, we present detailed out-of-sample prediction results for each agent in our cohort. The results are also summarized in Section 5. In Tables 1–3, we also report the total number of out-of-sample predictions that we made for each agent, across all call types that the agent handles. We provide additional detail in the supplement.

Hereafter, we refer to our cohort of agents as cohort C. It is important to note that these are not the 200 rightmost agents in Figs. 4–7. In total, these 200 agents handle 30 different call types, and the number of skills per agent ranges from 1 to 8. The average number of skills per agent, in this subset of the data, is 3.9.

In this section, we propose alternative models for the process of service times. We begin by describing two benchmark models which mimic standard practice.

The preliminary analysis of Section 2 suggests that service times depend strongly on both the agent and the call type considered; see Figs. 4–10. Let S
                        
                           i, j
                         denote the service time of a call of type j handled by agent i, where 
                           
                              j
                              =
                              1
                              ,

                              ,
                              J
                           
                         and 
                           
                              i
                              =
                              1
                              ,
                              2
                              ,
                              …
                              ,
                              I
                           
                        .

In our first benchmark model, Model B1, we assume that S
                        
                           i, j
                         are i.i.d. lognormal random variables with expected value mj
                         and variance vj
                        , for every i and j, where mj
                         and vj
                         depend solely on the call type j. In our second benchmark model, Model B2, we assume that the expected value m
                        
                           i, j
                         and the variance v
                        
                           i, j
                         depend on both the call type j and the agent i.

Since our data only consist of aggregated daily averages of service times, instead of detailed call-by-call data, it is not immediately clear how to compute point estimates for those expected values and variances. To do so, we adopt here the method of moments as in Deslauriers (2003). Alternatively, for a review of estimation methods (for the mean) with more detailed data, see Shen and Brown (2006).

We provide additional details for this method by focusing on estimation for Model B2. For Model B1, we do the same but do not distinguish between alternative agents handling the same call type. Let 
                              
                                 n
                                 
                                    i
                                    ,
                                    j

                         is the number of calls of type j answered on day k by agent i. That is, the number of calls answered in a given day is used as a weight in our regression model. We estimate the model in (3.3) using weighted least squares. Of course, modeling the mean service time as a linear function of time can only make sense as a rough approximation over a limited time interval. For example, a time-decreasing mean is typically due to a learning effect, but this effect eventually saturates and the slope of the decrease should become closer to 0 as time goes on. In fact, we will find that this model with a linear trend is outperformed by our next two models, which do not include such a linear trend. In addition to a linear time trend, we also considered quadratic and logarithmic trends. However, since models with such trends performed consistently worse, we only present results for a linear trend in this paper.

We found that the normality assumption of the mean service times is reasonable in our data. That is to be expected since our data consist of daily averages where each average is typically calculated based on tens of service times per day. For example, in Figs. 11
                         and 12
                        , we present normal Q–Q plots for the residuals of Model A1 for two agents, a
                        1 and a
                        2, along with pointwise 95 percent confidence bands. Agents a
                        1 and a
                        2 handled many calls of type A: 8360 and 8098 calls, respectively. We also got consistent results for agents who answer a relatively small number of calls of a given call type, e.g., 200–300 calls during the year. For all agent-call type pairs, we conducted the Lilliefors test for normality on the residuals of model A1; across all such pairs, the first three empirical quartiles of the distribution of p-values for this test are 0.005, 0.08, and 0.3, respectively. Overall, we found that there was typically not enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis that 
                           
                              
                                 α
                                 
                                    i
                                    ,
                                    j
                                 
                              
                              =
                              0
                           
                        . Specifically, the empirical estimates of the first three quartiles of the distribution of corresponding p-values are given by: 0.007, 0.2, and 0.5, respectively; in particular, we could not reject the null hypothesis in more than 60 percent of the agent-call type pairs. We also conducted Ljung–Box tests on the autocorrelations of residuals for Model A1, and the quartiles of the empirical distribution of p-values were 0.04, 0.3, and 0.6. For at least 25 percent of the agent-call type pairs, autocorrelations are significant at the 5 percent level.

Capturing dependencies between successive service times amounts to capturing dependencies between (approximately) normal mean service times. Mixed-effect models are ideal to capture such dependencies with roughly normally-distributed data; we now propose one such model. We consider a Gaussian linear mixed-effects model for

                         are normally distributed weekly deviations which we use to capture correlations in the average service times, for the same agent and call type, across successive weeks and across successive weekdays within the same week. Because of the aggregated nature of the available data, we do not consider a daily random effect in (3.4), but rather a weekly one, and we do not impose a covariance structure on the residuals

Here, the weekly random effect that follows an AR(1) process replaces the linear trend that we had in Model A1. It allows for a situation where for a given agent, for example, the mean decreases for some period of time due to learning, then remains stable, then increases later because the agent loses interest or has other problems, etc. This AR(1) process is very simple and yet sufficiently flexible to model such mid-term variations in the mean.

We also tried Model A2 with a linear trend as in A1 in addition to the AR(1) term, and found that the version without the linear trend provided a better fit to the data out of sample. For this reason, we omitted the linear trend. In Table 1, we present point estimates for the different parameters of Model A2, based on our data, for 3 agent/call type combinations. The p-values in the table are computed automatically in SAS® as follows: Assuming the normality of the random effects and residuals, we can construct a statistic depending on the fixed effects (β) and the random effects (γ) which can be shown to have approximately a t-distribution for which we can estimate the degrees of freedom. Based on this statistic we can make inference about whether the random and fixed effects (the linear trend) are equal to 0. The weekly random effect and the autocorrelation parameter are generally found to be statistically significant. When testing the linear trend, the quartiles of the empirical distribution of p-values were 0.06, 0.3, and 0.6. The trend is statistically significant at the 95 percent level for 125 pairs out of 550. For the model without the linear trend, autocorrelation is statistically significant at the 95 percent level for 246 pairs out of 550, and the quartiles of the distribution of p-values are 0, 0.002 and 0.3.

Dependencies in the time series of service times may be due to factors linked to the agents themselves, such as stress, fatigue, demotivation, etc. Such short-term effects may influence agent performance during a given period of time and cause dependencies between the service times of all calls handled by that same agent. Considering models with cross correlations is therefore important to capture similar effects.

In Model A3, we jointly model the service times of different call types handled by the same agent. We consider a mixed-effects model for the mean service time (just as in Model A2) where we merge alternative call types together and have the same weekly random effect common to all types handled by the same agent. This gives:

As an illustration, Table 2, gives parameter estimates of Model A3 for the agent i
                        0 considered in Table 1. Here, the p-value for the weekly random effect is 0.0858. Some other p-values are quite small. We also tested Model A3 with a linear trend, for our cohort of 200 agents, and the quartiles of the distribution of p-values for the test on the linear trend were 0.04, 0.3, and 0.6. That is, for most agents the trend is not significant. In out-of-sample goodness of fit tests and predictions based on Model A3 both with and without this linear trend, the version without a trend fit the data better. Therefore, we omit this linear trend from consideration in Sections 4 and 5. For the model without a trend, the autocorrelation parameter is usually found to be statistically significant: the quartiles of the distribution of p-values were (approximately) 0, 0.005, and 0.2.

In this section, we assess the goodness of fit to data of our candidate models.

We begin by analyzing the residuals of each model, where model residuals are defined to be equal to the differences between the observed daily average service times and the corresponding fitted values. In Table 3, we present summary statistics for the square of the residuals for our cohort C of agents; see Section 2. Table 3 shows that Models A2 and A3 are better fits to data than Model A1, B1 and B2, and that Model A2 is a slightly better fit than Model A3. Models B1 and B2 lag behind, and Model B1 clearly yields the worst fit.

We also compute estimates of the root mean squared errors (RMSE) for the cohort C under the different models. In Fig. 13
                        , we present box plots for the RMSE’s across all models. Fig. 13 shows that Models A2 and A3 are a better fit to data than the rest of the models. In Fig. 14
                        , we plot the empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF) of the RMSEs for all models. Once more, Fig. 14 shows that Models A2 and A3 provide superior fits to data compared to other models. For the RMSEs, we ran matched-pair t-tests, at the 95 percent confidence level, for all model pairs and found that the differences in RMSEs were all significantly different from 0 (the corresponding p-values of all tests were very close to 0).

We can use our candidate models to obtain full distributional fits for the service times, beyond expected values. However, given the aggregated nature of our data, it is not possible to investigate how well our models fit the distributions of the individual service times. Instead, we can only test how well they reproduce the distribution of daily averages observed in our data sample. In order to do so, we simulate independent replications of the mean service times under each model, and use the probability integral transform (PIT) (as in Rosenblatt, 1952) which is defined as follows for day k, agent i, and call type j:

                         should behave like i.i.d uniform U[0, 1] random variables for all i, j. To test whether the PITs under a given model are a good fit to the uniform distribution, we use chi-square goodness of fit tests under the 95 percent confidence criterion. Under these tests, the null hypothesis is that the PIT comes from a U[0, 1] distribution.

In Table 4, we summarize the results of those chi-square tests for the cohort C of agents that we considered. Recall that there are 550 different agent/skill combinations in the subset of the data that we consider. For each combination, we consider whether the uniform distribution is a good fit for the corresponding PITs. Then, for each model, we report the proportions of the chi-square tests that reject the null hypothesis at the 95 percent level. Table 4 shows that Models A2 and A3 yield better distributional fits to the data than Model A1 and the benchmark models, and that Models A2 and A3 fit the data roughly similarly. Indeed, Table 4 shows that, with Model 1, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of uniform PITs for only 59 percent of the different agent/skill combinations. In contrast, with Model A2, we fail to reject this null hypothesis for roughly 73 percent of the different agent/skill combinations, and with Model 3 we do so in roughly 70 percent of the agent/skill combinations. While these numbers remain below the desired 95 percent level, the improvement in fit over the remaining models, particularly the benchmark models commonly used in practice, is significant.

We now compare the statistical models of Section 3 based on their out-of-sample forecasting performance, for our cohort C of agents. For each agent and call type, each model, and each day i, we estimated the model based on all the observations up to day

                      is an out-of-sample forecast (based only on past information). We consider three different prediction lead times δ, namely 2 weeks, 1 week, and 1 day, to mimic real-life challenges faced by call center managers. We roll the learning period forward so as to preserve the length of the lead time. We re-estimate all model parameters after each prediction. We use the Mixed Procedure in SAS® to compute maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters for Model A2 and Model A3, and to generate the corresponding forecasts; see Section 2 of the supplement for a detailed description of how we compute each prediction.

We quantify the accuracy of a point prediction by computing the root mean squared error (RMSE) per day, defined by

In Tables 5 and 6, we report aggregate results for the out-of-sample forecasts over all 200 agents, call types, and days. Detailed numerical results for each agent are given in Tables 3–5 of the supplement. In Table 5, we include estimates of the average, the median, and the first and third quartiles of the MAPEs and RMSEs obtained across all agents. Recall that each MAPE and RMSE are over all call types and days, for each agent. We highlight in bold the minimum RMSE and MAPE in each row. Clearly, Model A3 is superior throughout. It clearly outperforms our benchmark models, commonly used in practice, particularly with a short forecasting lead time (one day). We now briefly discuss the results for lead times of 2 weeks and 1 day, respectively.

Over this long lead time, Models A2 and A3 perform nearly the same. Model B2 is competitive as well, and yields smaller prediction errors than Model A1, for both the MAPE and the RMSE. The average MAPE for Model A3 is roughly 12 percent lower than for A1 and 3 percent lower than for B2. On the other hand, Model B1 clearly lags behind, with a MAPE 26 percent larger than for Model A3. Similar results hold when comparing the average RMSE, which is roughly 18 percent larger for Model A1 than for A3, and 3 percent larger for B2 than for A3. We ran matched-pair t-tests, for all possible model pairs, to test if the differences in the RMSEs and MAPEs are significantly different from 0. The p-values of those tests were all very small (the difference is clearly significant, with p < 0.0001) except in two cases: When comparing the RMSEs for Models B1 and A1, we obtain

                            and when comparing the MAPEs for Models A2 and A3, we obtain 
                              
                                 p
                                 =
                                 0.12
                              
                           .

With a forecasting lead time of 1 day, the advantage of exploiting correlations between weekly averages increases. Models A1, A2, and A3 yield more accurate predictions than both benchmark models, with Model A3 taking the lead. For example, the average MAPE is roughly 6 percent smaller for Model A3 than for B2, and roughly 5 percent smaller for A2 than for A1. The average RMSE is roughly 10 percent smaller for Model A3 than for A1, and roughly 9 percent smaller for A2 than for A1. Model B1 is clearly outperformed by all other models. In matched-pair t-tests, all p-values were very small (p < 0.0001).


                           Table 6 compares the models from a different viewpoint: it reports the proportions of agents (in our cohort C) where each model yields the smallest performance measure, across all models. For example, the first row in Table 6 indicates that, across the 200 agents considered, the smallest MAPE was achieved by Model A1 for 20.2 percent of the agents, by Model A2 for 15.7 percent of the agents, and by Model A3 for 25.3 percent of the agents. With a forecasting lead time of two weeks, Model B2 is competitive, but it is still outperformed by Model A3. The proportions in Table 6 do not sum up exactly to unity because there may be multiple minimizers of the MAPE (or RMSE) for a given agent. In Table 6, Model A3 generally performs better than all remaining models. This is especially true with a short forecasting lead time. For example, with a lead time of 1 day, Model A3 yields the smallest RMSE for 42.4 percent of the agents, compared with 11.6 percent for B2.

                            and 16
                           , we plot the empirical cumulative distribution functions for the RMSEs and MAPEs, respectively, for all models, with a lead time of one day. These figures illustrate the improvement in forecasting accuracy that is summarized in Table 5.

In the previous sections, we illustrated the improvement in goodness-of-fit to data, both in-sample and out-of-sample, which results from considering more realistic service-time models. We now discuss the results of simulation studies which assess the impact of considering different service-time models on performance measures of interest in a call center. Specifically, we consider both the average waiting time (AWT) of calls and the service level (SL(s)), defined as the percentage of calls whose waiting times are less than s seconds (for fixed s).

Our objective in this subsection is to quantify the differences in average system performance across our alternative service-time models. As such, we show that effectively modelling service times also matters from an operational point of view. To do so, we consider a model of a small subset of the real HQ call center from which our data was taken.

We consider two call types and two agent groups, and an N-queueing design for call routing (1 flexible and 1 dedicated agent pools). The two call types are for the same type of service (related to billing), but one is in French (F) while the other is in English (E). The first group (F, with 10 agents, numbered from 1 to 10) can only handle the first call type and the second group (EF, with 2 agents, numbered 11 and 12) can handle both. That is, F agents only answer calls in French and EF agents are bilingual. Those 12 agents are the ones that worked on each day of week number 45 in our data set, and handled only those two call types. The center is open from 8 hours to 18 hours. The arrival process for each of the two call types is piecewise-Poisson, with a gamma random arrival rate in each 15-minute time interval, and a normal copula to model the dependence between those rates. This model is explained in Oreshkin et al. (2015), where it was also shown to provide a good fit to the arrival data for this HQ call center. The arrival rates were scaled down to fit our smaller number of agents. Abandonments are modeled with exponential patience times. Calls are served in first-come-first-served order within each group. All other details, such as the parameters of the arrival-rate model, the abandonment rates, and the detailed staffing and routing rules are given in the supplement (Section 3).

The target day that we simulate is Friday of week 45. For each selected agent, and each skill for the EF agents, we estimate the parameters of models B1, B2, A2, and A3 based on all data collected until Thursday of week 45. (We omit A1 because it is outperformed by A2 and A3.) Using those parameter estimates, we generate service times for each agent on that Friday. For B1 and B2, this is straightforward. For A2, as in (3.4), we can write, omitting the specific indices for simplicity, that

                         where N is the number of calls of that type handled by the agent on that day. To simulate one day, we first generate γ from the appropriate normal distribution and, conditional on γ, we generate independent service times that are lognormal with mean 
                           
                              β

                        . For A3, we proceed in a similar way. In Table 1 of the supplementary data, we present the RMSE and MAPE (comparing mean actual and predicted service times) for call types E and F, corresponding to each service-time model. And, in Table 2 of the supplementary data, we present the observed average service times for our simulated Friday, the forecasts from each service-time model, and estimated values for 
                           
                              σ

Our model was simulated for 
                           
                              r
                              =

                         independent days under each service-time model with all remaining system parameters held fixed. We purposely choose a large number of simulation replications so as to ensure that the differences observed between our alternative service-time models are statistically significant. We used inversion with common random numbers across the four models to generate the lognormal service times. Thus, the only differences between the four models (in the simulations) are the means and variances of the lognormal service times. We computed the AWT W and the service level SL(120) (the fraction of calls answered within 120 seconds), for each simulated day. In Table 7
                        , we report 95 percent confidence intervals for

                         and

                              L

                         based on those r simulations, for each model and call type. Table 7 illustrates potential differences in the SL and AWT across the different models. Although such differences may appear minimal at first glance, they could lead to significant cost savings in practice. For example, ACS Wireless found that decreasing the AWT by a mere 0.6 second lead to $8 million of savings annually (Hanks, 2014). Also, small percent differences in the SL could mean the difference between abiding and violating service-level agreements, which may involve hefty penalties for the call center. Thus, our numerical results illustrate that different service-time models may lead to different average system performances. Such differences could lead to significant cost reductions in practice.
                     

Our service-time models could be used in practice to enable a more accurate assessment of the performance of different agents. This, in turn, allows for better agent classification into pools handling different call types. Next, we investigate such selection effects.

It is intuitively clear that changing the expected service times (or service rates), all else remaining unchanged, can have a strong impact on the performance measures in the system. In simple models, e.g., Erlang-A for a single call type, such performance impact can be computed or approximated easily by a formula. It has also been observed that if agents are heterogeneous in terms of expected service times and a subset of those agents is chosen at random for a given day, then the mean expected service time for the selected agent group has more variability than if all agents were identical (Gans et al., 2010), and the AWT over the day should also exhibit a larger variance and (intuitively) a larger mean.


                        Gans et al. (2010) showed that agent heterogeneity affects the average waiting times. In this subsection, we go beyond their results and look in more detail on the impact of that heterogeneity on the distribution of the AWT, going beyond just the means. In particular, suppose that we have a fixed pool of agents, each with a given skill set and a given service-time distribution for each skill. Suppose that we select, at random, a subset S from this pool, say with a fixed number of agents for each skill set, on a given day. Letting W denote the AWT value for that day, we have that

                        in this variance decomposition, the first term is the variability due to the randomness of S, and the second term is the residual variability of W once the set S is known.


                        Gans et al. (2010) reported an experiment in which they selected 12 agents with exponential service times and service rates ranging from 3.86 to 6.33, with an average of 5.015. They simulated 100 independent days as follows. On each day, they picked a set S of 6 agents at random from the original 12, and then simulated a small Erlang-A call center model with Poisson arrivals at a rate of 21 calls per hour, abandonment rate of 2 per hour, and the 6 selected agents. With a service rate of 5.015 for all agents, the Erlang-A formula gives an AWT of 58.8 seconds over an infinite-time horizon. How long was the simulated day? Gans et al. plotted a histogram of the 100 values of W obtained from their simulation and observed a large variability: about 1/3 of the values are more than 12 seconds (20 percent) away from 58.8. As such, their example illustrates that “a random draw of 6 from the 12 service rates described above will most typically yield results that do not match the intended QoS target” (p. 111).

We now go further: the variability of W has two parts, as shown in (6.1), and only the first part is due to the random draw of service rates. To estimate the two parts, for each of the

                        . This is indeed a very large spread. That is, selecting the agents at random does not have a large impact on the variance of the AWT. Nevertheless, selecting specific agent subsets can lead to significantly different values for the AWT.
                     

To illustrate the potential impact of agent selection for a given day, we now consider additional simulations for models B2, A2, and A3 (we omit model B1 because it assumes that all agents are identical). Here, we summarize our results in Tables 8
                         and 9
                        ; for corresponding histograms of the results, see Figs. 7–9 in the supplement. In the previous example, the F agents numbered 1, 2 and 8 (in Table 2 of the supplementary material) are slowest and agents 3, 7, and 10 are the fastest (according to actual mean service times). We replace the three slowest agents by clones of the three fastest agents, so that we now have two copies of agents 3, 7, and 10. With this new staffing, we simulated 
                           
                              r
                              =

                         independent days and computed W and SL for each day, as in the previous example. In Table 8, we report 95 percent confidence intervals for 
                           
                              E

                              W
                              ]
                           
                         and 
                           
                              E
                              [
                              S
                              L

                         based on these r simulations, for each model and each call type. We find that, in comparing with Table 7, performance has improved significantly in the system, across all service-time models. We also note in passing that the differences between the performances according to the alternative models are greater under this choice of agent pool.

Suppose now that we replace EF agent 11 by a clone of (the slower) agent 12 in our original example, and we repeat the same experiment. In Table 9, we present the results for this case. Comparing Table 9 with Table 7 shows that system performance is significantly degraded, despite changing only one agent. Thus, our numerical results show that selecting specific agent groups with different processing speeds, based on our service-time models, can lead to significant differences in system performance.
                     

In this paper, we took a data-based approach to modelling service times in call centers. We evaluated the goodness-of-fit to data, both in-sample and out-of-sample, of several service-time models. Our models incorporate several properties commonly observed in practice, such as: (1) agent/call type heterogeneity, (2) a time-dependent performance of agents, (3) the existence of cross/serial correlations in the data. In general, we found that models which exploit those properties are superior to models which do not. To demonstrate the added benefit of that improved goodness-of-fit, we presented and discussed results of simulation experiments which showed that: (1) selecting different service-time models may have a significant impact on average system performance, potentially leading to significant cost cuts, and (2) our service-time models may be used to aid in agent classification into different pools, and system performances under different pools can be drastically different. In our simulation study, we considered a relatively small call center setting to illustrate the operational impact due to different service-time models. In reality, we anticipate that such an impact will be most pronounced in small to medium call centers (tens of agents), and may be smaller, due to averaging effects, with a very large agent population. Nevertheless, the statistical properties (of service times) that we observed in our data set should continue to apply more broadly, irrespective of the size of the call center at hand.

Given the promising results that we obtained using Models A2 and A3, one possible direction for future research is to consider alternative similar models which incorporate daily, or intra-daily, random effects when modeling individual service times. For these models, we may also experiment with nonparametric functions for the trends. To do so requires access to a detailed call-by-call data set. Given the results of Section 5, we anticipate that such models will lead to increasingly accurate predictions of future mean service times in the system. With a detailed call-by-call data set, it would also be possible to test for the goodness of fit and predictive accuracy of those models beyond the mean service time. That is, we could test how well those models fit the entire distributions of individual service times in the system. Indeed, complex operational decisions in call centers rely on having models that accurately fit and predict those distributions. We leave developing such models, testing them with data, and assessing their operational performance via simulation, to future research.
