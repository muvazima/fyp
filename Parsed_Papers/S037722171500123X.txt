                  We consider a continuous time–cost tradeoff problem with multiple milestones and completely ordered jobs. If a milestone is tardy, a penalty cost may be imposed. The processing times of jobs can be compressed by additional resources or activities that incur compression costs. The objective is to minimize the total penalty cost plus the total compression cost. We show that the problem is NP-hard, even if the compression cost is described as a concave function, and we present a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for that case. Furthermore, we show that the problem is polynomially solvable if the compression cost function is convex.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The time–cost tradeoff problem (TCTP) assumes that each job’s processing time can be compressed by using additional resources such as equipment, labor, or capital (Ford and Fulkerson, 1962; Kelley, 1961). The typical objective is to minimize the project completion time subject to a constraint on the budget for compression or to minimize the total cost for compression subject to a constraint on the project completion time.

The continuous TCTP (CTCTP) is defined as a TCTP in which the compression cost is described as a continuous function. The linear TCTP (LTCTP) is a special case of the CTCTP such that the compression cost function is linear. The LTCTP can be formulated as a linear programming problem and efficiently solved by the network flow method introduced by Fulkerson (1961) and Kelley (1961). For a comprehensive review of more general models (e.g., resource-constrained project scheduling), see Artigues, Demassey, and Neron (2008); Brucker, Drexl, Möhring, Neumann, and Pesch (1999); Demeulemeester and Herroelen (2002); Weglarz (1999); Weglarz, Jozefowska, Mika, and Waligora (2011).

The TCTP studies above assume a single milestone for the overall project, that is, the last job. In reality, however, multiple milestones can exist within a project. Thus, if an appointed task is not completed at the milestone, a penalty is imposed. For example, a venture capital company makes small investments in a project at first and then, when a milestone has been reached, determines whether to stop the project or make more investments, depending on the progress of the project (Bell, 2000; Sahlman, 1994). To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted on a TCTP with more than one milestone, except that of Choi and Chung (2014). These authors considered two LTCTPs with multiple milestones and completely ordered jobs. The objective of the first problem is to minimize the total weighted number of tardy jobs subject to a constraint on the total compression cost. The second objective is to minimize the total weighted number of tardy jobs plus the total compression cost. The authors proved the NP-hardness of the first problem and the polynomiality of the second.

This paper considers a generalized version of the second problem introduced by Choi and Chung (2014), in which the compression cost function can be nonlinear. The time–cost relation has been studied in several papers. Nonlinear (Moussourakis and Haksever, 2010), concave (Falk and Horowitz, 1972), and convex compression cost functions (Berman, 1964; Lamberson and Hocking, 1970) have been studied for the TCTP.

Our problems can be formally stated as follows. The CTCTP is represented by a directed activity-on-node graph

                           Schedules in which each job is processed as soon as possible by not allowing unnecessary idle time;

Compression cost functions that are either concave or convex.

The concavity of the compression cost function means increasing marginal returns, such that, as we input more resources, the addition of resources become more productive. In other words, two workers are more than twice as productive as one worker and four workers are more than twice as productive as two workers. The convexity reflects the general law of diminishing marginal returns, such that, as the number of new workers increases, the marginal productivity of an additional worker is less than that of the previous workers. Note that the relationship between the investment of the additional resources and the marginal productivity is corresponding to the one between the compression cost function and the compression amount in our model.

Since each job has a unique starting time under each value of x, let x be termed the schedule. Let D⊆V be the set of milestones. Note that each milestone corresponds to a specific job. For j ∈ D, let

                      is the set of tardy milestones under x. The CTCTP-chain is motivated by a product development process following a sequential pattern in which information about the product tends to be accumulated slowly in consecutive stages (Roemer and Ahmadi, 2004). Each stage can begin only when its immediately preceding stage obtains complete and final information after termination.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces properties of some optimal schedules for the CTCTP-chain. Section 3 shows that the CTCTP-chain with a concave compression cost function, referred to as a concave-CTCTP-chain, is NP-hard and can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time. Section 4 shows that the CTCTP-chain with a convex compression cost function, referred to as a convex-CTCTP-chain, is polynomially solvable. The final section presents concluding remarks and discusses future work.

In this section, we introduce properties of some optimal schedules for the CTCTP-chain. Let job j be referred to as a just-in-time (JIT) job in x if it is completed exactly on its due date, that is,

                        Lemma 1
                        There exists an optimal schedule satisfying one of the following conditions:

                              
                                 (i)
                                 All jobs are uncompressed.

There exists at least one JIT job.

Let x* be an optimal schedule with the most JIT jobs. If x* satisfies (i) or (ii), then the proof is complete. Now, suppose that an optimal schedule x* has compressed jobs and no JIT job. Let job l be the last compressed job in x* and let E be the set of non-tardy jobs in

                            then job l is uncompressed. By repeatedly applying this argument, we can construct an optimal schedule satisfying (i) or (ii).□

By Lemma 1, an optimal schedule can be found by comparing a schedule with all uncompressed jobs and an schedule with minimum costs among schedules with at least one JIT job. Henceforth, we consider only schedules in which the number of JIT jobs is at least one.

                        Lemma 2
                        There exists an optimal schedule such that jobs processed after the last JIT job are uncompressed.

Since a similar argument in the proof of Lemma 1 holds, we omit the details.□

Henceforth, we only consider those schedules satisfying Lemmas 1 and 2.

In this section, we show that the concave-CTCTP-chain is NP-hard and introduce an approach to solve it in pseudo-polynomial time.

In this section, we show that the decision version of the concave-CTCTP-chain is NP-complete by reduction from the partition problem, which is known to be NP-complete (Garey and Johnson, 1979).

                              . By repeating the above argument, we obtain an optimal schedule such that the number of partially compressed jobs between consecutive JIT jobs is at most one. Thus, Lemma 3 holds.□

The concave-CTCTP-chain can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time.

By Lemma 3, it suffices to find an optimal integer schedule. Let

The problem of obtaining an optimal solution of CON(k, l) with the smallest tardy weight in O can be solved in polynomial time.

First, compute an optimal solution

                            be the set of maximal intervals on which fj
                           (xj
                           ) is linear. Note that Ij
                            is given as an input of the problem. Hence we can find intervals containing

                           Note that if any of the inequalities (9) are not satisfied, then jobs k and l cannot become consecutive JIT jobs. The length of the arc from N(k) to N(l) is the cost incurred when jobs k and l are selected as consecutive JIT jobs. By Theorem 3, the optimal schedule of CON(k, l) with the smallest tardy weight, denoted x
                           
                              k, l
                           , can be obtained in polynomial time. The set of tardy jobs between jobs k and l, denoted T(x
                           
                              k, l
                           ), can be obtained by the compression of jobs according to x
                           
                              k, l
                           . Thus, the length of the arc from N(k) to N(l) is

                           . The shortest length is the optimal cost of the convex-CTCTP-chain.

In the reduced SPP, the number of nodes is O(n) and the number of arcs is O(n
                           2), since the number of arcs from each node is O(n). The length of each arc can be obtained in polynomial time. Thus, this reduction is carried out in polynomial time. Since the reduced graph is a directed acyclic graph, the reduced SPP can be solved in O(n
                           2) according to the algorithm of Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (2001). The proof is complete.□

We proved the NP-hardness of the concave-CTCTP-chain and introduced an approach to solve it in pseudo-polynomial time. Furthermore, we showed the polynomiality of the convex-CTCTP-chain by reduction to the SPP.

For future research, it would be interesting to analyze the computational complexity of the CTCTP on more general networks.
