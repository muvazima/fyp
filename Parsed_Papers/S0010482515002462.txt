@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase found in all eukaryotes that was one of the first kinases to be identified and studied. GSK-3 was initially named for its ability to phosphorylate, and thereby inactivate, glycogen synthase, a key regulatory process in the glycogen synthesis [1–3]. GSK-3 exists as two closely related isoforms, alpha (51kDa) and beta (47kDa), which are expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues encoded by separate genes. The proteins share 97% sequence similarity within their kinase catalytic domains, but differ significantly from one another outside this region, with GSK-3 alpha possessing an extended N-terminal glycine-rich tail [4].

Beyond its role in glycogen metabolism GSK-3 phosphorylates, it regulates the functions of many metabolic, signaling, and structural proteins. Initially recognized as the modulator of glycogen metabolism, GSK-3 is now consequently implicated to play an important regulatory role in many different pathways including the initiation of protein synthesis, tumorigenesis, cell survival, apoptosis, and is essential for embryonic development as a component of the Wnt signaling cascade. GSK-3 can be considered as a target for both metabolic and neurological disorders [5,6]. GSK-3 is constitutively active in resting cells and is inhibited by several hormones such as insulin, endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. Insulin has been demonstrated to cause the inactivation of GSK-3. The mechanism of inactivation is associated with the phosphorylation of the specific serine residues Ser21 and Ser9 in GSK-3 isoforms α and β, respectively, but does not cause the accumulation of β-catenin. GSK-3 has a very important role in the regulation of glycogen synthesis and possible involvement in the development of insulin resistance in type II diabetes [7]. So, GSK-3 is an attractive therapeutic target for the development of selective inhibitors as promising new antidiabetic drugs [8]. GSK-3 inhibitors are classified into three types: ATP competitive inhibitors, non-ATP competitive inhibitors, and metal ion competitive inhibitors (in Mg2+ binding site) [9]. Many research works focus on the structural requirements of GSK-3 inhibitors. Maleimide derivates appear to be among the most selective ATP competitive GSK-3 inhibitors identified so far [10–19].

Quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods are widely used in modern drug design and discovery because of the early prediction of activity-related characteristics of drug candidates and the possibility to eliminate molecules with undesired properties [20–22]. The main aim of all QSAR modeling is to develop a simple mathematical equation that correlates a molecule׳s studied biological activity with its properties derived as quantitative parameters entitled as descriptors. Therefore, descriptors can be defined as entities that characterize specific information of the studied molecule in terms that they are numerical values associated with the chemical constitution for correlation of chemical structure with biological activity. The developed equation should provide insights into the essential structural requisites of the molecule which contribute to biological activity. Depending on the computational determination, descriptors can be classified as physico-chemical (hydrophobic, steric, or electronic), topological, electronic (molecular orbit calculations), geometric, structural (frequency of occurrence of a substructure) or simple indicator parameter. Furthermore, molecular descriptors can be classified in two major groups – substituent constants and whole molecular descriptors. Also, descriptors can be classified according to dimensions [23]. QSAR models based on geometry-dependent molecular descriptors usually have a relatively difficult calculation of the optimum molecular geometry, high computational costs and long computational calculation time. For these reasons, the conformation-independent (0D, 1D and 2D-QSPR) method models based on the constitutional and topological molecular features of compounds emerged as an alternative approach [24,25]. QSAR modeling is often based on optimal descriptors calculated with the molecular graph [26–28]. The simplified molecular input-line entry system (SMILES) can be considered as an alternative for the representation of the molecular structure by the molecular graph [29–31]. A SMILES notation based optimal descriptor is a molecular descriptor which depends both on the molecular structure and the property under analysis, but does not explicitly depend on details from the 3D-molecular geometry. The development of QSAR models, where the SMILES is the representation of the molecular structure and is used for developing optimal descriptors, is an attractive direction of research work in the field of the QSAR theory and applications [32–34]. Previous QSPR/QSAR studies have shown the importance of this methodology, which was capable of developing models with a comparable or sometimes better quality to the ones built with descriptors in a pool containing thousands of 0D–3D descriptors [35–42].

The aim of this study is to build a QSAR model based on the SMILES notation optimal descriptors using the Monte Carlo method for both 3-anilino-4-arylmaleimide derivatives and maleimide derivatives as glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitors and an attempt to define the molecular fragments responsible for the stated inhibitory effect. Further, we used the build model and defined molecular fragments for the computer aided drug design of new potentially promising glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitors.

@&#METHOD@&#

The first QSAR model was developed for a series of 74 3-anilino-4-arylmaleimide derivatives acting as glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitors [11]. General structures of 3-anilino-4-arylmaleimide derivatives are shown in 
                        Fig. 1. The second QSAR model was developed for a series of 177 maleimide derivatives with various organic substituents added to the basic maleimide structure [11–18]. General structures of all studied maleimide derivatives are presented in Fig. 1. Molecular structures of studied compounds were transformed into canonical SMILES [12]. The SMILES used in the present study was generated with the ACD/ChemSketch program (ACD/ChemSketch v. 11.0). For representing the pharmacological activity, pIC50 (−logIC50) was used as a dependent variable for building both QSAR models (Table S1). These biological data ranged over five logarithmic units (3.026–8.523). The QSAR model for 3-anilino-4-arylmaleimide derivatives was built up for one random split (20% of compounds were used in the test set). The QSAR model for maleimide derivatives was built up for one random split also but with different splittings of the original molecule data set. Data were split into the training, test and validation set (20% of compounds were used in the test and validation set). In a SMILES-based QSAR modeling different sets have different roles. The training set is used for developing a QSAR model, the test set is used for estimating the predicted potential of the developed QSAR model in cases of various threshold values. The “invisible” validation set is used for the final estimation of the model with a defined threshold value which gives the best statistical quality for the test set. For this reasons training and test sets are “visible” during model building up, but no information on the “invisible” validation set is used in the modeling process [43]. The normality distribution plot of the whole dataset was checked according to literature [44].

The main concept of the QSAR modeling can be defined as the following:
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 Endpoint
                                 =
                                 F
                                 (
                                 Molecular
                                 
                                 Structure
                                 )
                              
                           
                        
                     

One of the most convenient molecule structure representations can be achieved with the simplified molecular input-line entry system (SMILES) notation. Further, the SMILES notation can be used for defining a molecular optimal descriptor (DCW) which is further used for QSAR modeling. DCW can be calculated as a function of the SMILES with Eq. (2)
                        
                           
                              (2)
                              
                                 DCW
                                 =
                                 F
                                 
                                    (
                                    
                                       SMILES
                                    
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

There are two types of optimal descriptors defined with the molecular SMILES notation. The first is a local SMILES attribute, a fragment of the SMILES notation which contains one (‘C’, ‘N’, ‘=’, etc.) or two symbols (‘Cl’, ‘Br’, ‘@@’, etc.) which cannot be examined separately. These SMILES attributes can be defined as SMILES atoms. The application of local SMILES attributes is the simplest way for defining the molecular DCW as a mathematical function of SMILES atoms, i.e. as a mathematical function of each character of the SMILES. Not only local can SMILES attributes be used for QSAR modeling but also global SMILES attributes: a characteristic of a molecule in whole, e.g. the presence of nitrogen together with oxygen, the presence of double bonds and cycles, the presence of nitrogen and sulfur and absence of oxygen, and others. When both SMILES based optimal descriptors are used for QSAR modeling, DCW is calculated as the following Eq. (3):

When the Monte Carlo method is used, each calculated optimal descriptor receives a numerical value defined as correlation weight (CW). The applied Monte Carlo method is based on a principle that suitable random numbers are generated and further observed how that fraction of numbers obeys some property/properties. The computation for obtaining and distribution of an unknown probabilistic entity can be achieved with the application of iterative algorithms [45]. The inclusion of SMILES based descriptors in the QSAR model development can be achieved with the application of a simple rule – if the value of a coefficient is 1 then an appropriate descriptor is included or if it is 0, then an appropriate descriptor is discarded form model building. For this reason coefficients z, x, y, t, α, β and γ from Eq. (3) are either 1 (yes) or 0 (no). There are two types of SMILES notation based descriptors – local and global. Global SMILES based descriptors are based on a molecule as a whole entity. In this paper all global SMILES based descriptors or SMILES based indices are used (ATOMPAIR, BOND, NOSP, HALO). Local SMILES based descriptors can be considered as molecular fragments related to an appropriate SMILES notation. The first and the simplest one is Sk (SMILES atom), a descriptor related to one SMILES symbol (or two that cannot be separated). A linear combination of two or three SMILES atoms are descriptors defined as SSk and SSSk 
                        [34,46]. The main purpose of the Monte Carlo optimization process is the calculation of the numerical data for CW which gives the maximal value of the correlation coefficient between the endpoint and the optimal descriptor. The Monte Carlo method employs two parameters for the computation of stated numerical values – Threshold (T) and the Number of epochs (N
                        epoch). Threshold is defined as the separator of calculated SMILES based descriptors into active and inactive. If the descriptor is active then T has some numerical value, but if the descriptor is inactive then T has a fixed value of zero. The number of epochs (N
                        epoch) is related to the computational iterative process with one aim – to obtain the best statistical quality for the training set [34,46].

The linear regression approach is used as a method for developing a QSAR model after all CW are calculated (Eq. (4))

CORAL software was used (http://www.insilico.eu/coral) for building QSAR models. Building QSAR models took into consideration all SMILES descriptors (both local and global attributes: ATOMPAIR, BOND, NOSP, Sk, SSk and SSSk). The search for the most predictive combination of T and N
                        epoch for all splits was performed from values 0–10 for T and 0–60 for N
                        epoch.

The main goal of any QSAR modeling is to develop a robust model capable of predicting the properties of new molecules in an objective, reliable and precise manner [47]. The assessment of robustness and reliability of a developed QSAR model can be achieved with the application of three methods [48]: (a) internal validation or cross-validation using the training set compounds, (b) external validation using the test set compounds and (c) data randomization or Y-scrambling. This methodology was successfully applied for the validation of SMILES notation optimal descriptor based QSAR models [34–42]. Another main aspect of a built QSAR model is its applicability domain. When a QSPR model is developed, compounds from the training set can be used for defining the applicability domain (AD) of the QSPR model. This step in QSAR modeling is very important since AD is used for the assessment of the reliability of the developed QSAR model. AD of the developed QSAR model is defined as the biological, structural or physico-chemical space, knowledge or information on which the model of the training set is developed and which can be used for predicting whether the developed QSAR model can be used on compounds which are not used in model developing. When a compound is very different in comparison to all compounds of the modeling set (this assessment is made with the application of AD) then a reliable prediction of its property/activity is uncertain [49]. The DModX (distance to model) approach at 95% confidence level was used for checking the applicability domain for all built models with the application of SIMCA-P software (v. 13.0.3 Demo version) [50].

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

For both QSAR models, the applied methodology for testing the normality of distribution shows that values are distributed in normal fashion. The results from the applied methodology for defining AD show that all molecules are within the defined AD (Figs. S1 and S2). For this reason all studied compounds have typical behavior and all were taken into consideration when QSAR models were built. 
                     Table 1 shows the statistical quality of the built QSAR model for 3-anilino-4-arylmaleimide derivatives acting as glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitors. The presented results reveal that there is the reproduction of the statistical quality for the calculated model in three runs of the Monte Carlo optimization. Further, the results from Table 1 show that the predictability is very good. In addition, all presented models for IC50 are satisfactory from the point of view of new criteria [51,52]. Table S2 (Supplementary material) shows Y-randomization [34] which also confirms the robustness of suggested models. The search for preferable T and N
                     epoch revealed that preferable T is 5 and preferable N
                     epoch is 5. 
                     Fig. 2 graphically shows the best Monte Carlo optimization run (the highest value for r
                     2) for the built QSAR model and a radar plot for the developed QSAR model.

DCW(T,N
                     epoch) for compounds in the training and test set are calculated as described in Section 2 of this manuscript. The application of the above-mentioned T and the N
                     epoch gives the following model for the pIC50 calculated according to Eq. (4)

The comparison of the obtained results with published QSAR models can be achieved only if the same molecule data is used [43]. Akhtar and Bharatam reported QSAR models based on the CoMSIA and CoMFA approach. The predictive correlation coefficient r
                     2
                     pred of 0.82 for the CoMSIA and 0.87 for the CoMFA models indicates good external predictive ability of the model [12]. Prasanna et al. reported QSAR models based on the CoMSIA and CoMFA approach also [53]. The best CoMFA model had the following statistical parameters: q
                     2=0.844, r
                     2=0.942, SEE=0.104, F=162.49 and r
                     2
                     pred=0.779 for five components. The best CoMSIA model statistical parameters: q
                     2=0.833, r
                     2=0.932, SEE=0.113, F=111.67 and r
                     2
                     pred=0.803 for six components. Sivaprakasam et al. reported 2D-QSAR modeling [54]. Amongst all reported 2D-QSAR models, the best models had the highest squared correlation coefficient (r
                     2=0.85) as well as the highest internal predictivity (q
                     2=0.81). The QSAR model presented in this research showed better or similar statistical parameter values and better predictability results. Furthermore, the descriptors used in this research are based just on the SMILES notation, completely ignoring 3D structure, which leads to faster computation time and reducing commutation resources.

The above-mentioned reasons define the presented QSAR method as a promising method for modeling glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitors and for this reason a QSAR model for maleimide derivatives was developed. 
                     Table 2 shows the statistical quality of the built QSAR model for maleimide derivatives acting as glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitors. Like results from the statistical analysis for the QSAR model for 3-anilino-4-arylmaleimide derivatives, the presented results for the QSAR model for maleimide derivatives revealed that there is also the reproduction of the statistical quality for calculated model in three runs of the Monte Carlo optimization. Results from Table 2 show that the predictability is very good, even better in comparison to the QSAR model for 3-anilino-4-arylmaleimide derivatives. In addition, all presented models for IC50 are satisfactory from the point of view of new criteria [41,42]. Table S2 (Supplementary material) shows Y-randomization [34] which also confirms the robustness of the developed model. The search for preferable T and N
                     epoch revealed that preferable T is 4 and preferable N
                     epoch 10. 
                     Fig. 3 graphically shows the best Monte Carlo optimization run (the highest value for r
                     2) for the built QSAR model and a radar plot for the developed QSAR model.

DCW(T,N

According to calculated correlation weights (CW) values of molecular features (SAk) from three Monte Carlo optimization runs, obtained from SMILES notation based optimal descriptors, SAk can be classified as promoters of increase, or promoters of decrease of a studied activity, and as undefined molecular features. This classification is obtained when a simple rule is applied to obtained results: if CW(SAk) obtained from three independent Monte Carlo optimization runs is positive then that SAk is the promoter of increase; if CW(SAk) from three independent Monte Carlo optimization runs is negative then that SAk is the promoter of decrease; if there are both positive and negative values of CW(Sk) in three runs of the Monte Carlo optimization process, then that SAk has an undefined role [26–29,32,33]. The list of all SAk, with the correlation weights for three runs of the Monte Carlo optimization process of the built QSAR model for maleimide derivatives is shown in Table S3. The built QSAR model represented with Eq. (6) has the mechanistic interpretation as well as calculated SAk which can be further defined as molecular fragments. According to the presented data, several important SAks that can be classified as promoters of pIC50 value increase are C………. (methyl group), C…C……. (ethyl group), C…C…C… (propyl group), O………. (oxygen atom), O…C……. (methoxy group), O…C…C… (ethoxy group), S………. (sulfur atom), S…C……. (sp
                     3 
                     carbon atom connected to), ++++N---B2== (the presence of a nitrogen atom and a double bond in the molecule), ++++N---O=== (the presence of a nitrogen and an oxygen atom in the molecule), ++++N---S=== (the presence of a nitrogen and sulfur atom in the molecule), ++++S---B2== (the presence of a sulfur atom and a double bond in the molecule).

The analysis of SAk shown in Table S3 can be useful in the search and computer aided design of novel maleimide derivatives with desired pIC50 values. The structures of novel maleimide derivatives obtained by molecular modeling are shown in 
                     Fig. 4. As a template for molecular design, the molecule 1 from dataset was selected as a molecule with a high value of pIC50. One of the goals of the presented molecular design was to obtain molecules with higher pIC50 values in comparison to the template molecule, since higher pIC50 values mean that a lower concentration is needed to inhibit 50% of an enzyme. Molecular structures presented as the SMILES notation of designed molecules and their calculated pIC50 values obtained with the application of the built QSAR model for maleimide derivatives (Eq. (6)) are shown in 
                     Table 3.


                     Table S4 shows an example of calculation DCW(3,5) for the template molecule A. When Eq. (6) is applied for calculating DCW, the resulting endpoint value (pIC50) is 6.4275. Molecules A1, A2 and A3 have added different groups in meta position. Molecules A4, A5 and A6 have added the same groups respectively in ortho position. Molecules A1 and A4 have added a methyl group that can be defined according to the SMILES notation as C………. Calculated values for pIC50 vary in comparison to the template molecule A and in comparison to each other. The molecule A4 has a higher value for pIC50 in comparison to molecules A and A1, what was obtained with simple addition of a methyl group defined as the promoter of increase. However, the molecule A1 has a lower value of pIC50 in comparison to molecules A and A1. The explanation for this is the fact that the addition of a methyl group in meta position is translated in the SMILES notation as further molecular branching. For this reason additional SAks are presented – (………. and C…(…….)), both defined as promoters of pIC50 decrease. Their numerical XXX values for the methyl group pIC50 increase which leads to pIC50 values decrease. The molecule A2 has added a methoxy group to the molecule A. The contribution of this group is higher than that of molecular branching and for this reason pIC50 is higher in comparison to the molecule A. The same case is with the molecule A3 which has added the primary amino group (methyl amino) in meta position. Molecules A5 and A6 have added a hydroxyl and amino group, respectively, both promoters of pIC50 increase. Since addition in ortho position in this case did not lead to more SAks addition, pIC50 values for designed molecules were higher in comparison to the template molecule A.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

QSAR models for 3-anilino-4-arylmaleimide derivatives and maleimide derivatives as glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitors were built. The Monte Carlo optimization process incorporated within The CORAL software is able to be an efficient tool to build up robust models with good statistical quality. The predictive potential of the applied approach was tested and the robustness of the model was proven with different methods. The SMILES attributes, which are promoters of IC50 increase/decrease are identified. The suggested modeling process and computer aided drug design are based on computational experiments with the application of statistically stable structural alerts (promoters of increase or decrease of IC50). This approach can be applied in the search for new potential glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitors.
