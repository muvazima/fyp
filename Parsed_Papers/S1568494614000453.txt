                  The design and implementation of efficient abstract data types are important issues for software developers. Selecting and creating the appropriate data structure for implementing an abstract data type is not a trivial problem for a software developer, as it is hard to anticipate all the usage scenarios of the deployed application. Moreover, it is not clear how to select a good implementation for an abstract data type when access patterns to it are highly variant, or even unpredictable. The problem of automatic data structure selection is a complex one because each particular data structure is usually more efficient for some operations and less efficient for others, that is why a static analysis for choosing the best representation can be inappropriate, as the performed operations cannot be statically predicted. Therefore, we propose a predictive model in which the software system learns to choose the appropriate data representation, at runtime, based on the effective data usage pattern. This paper describes a novel approach in using a support vector machine model in order to dynamically select the most suitable representation for an aggregate according to the software system's execution context. Computational experiments confirm a good performance of the proposed model and indicates the potential of our proposal. The advantages of our approach in comparison with similar existing approaches are also emphasized.
