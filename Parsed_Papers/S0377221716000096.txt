@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  Durable products are characterized by their modular structured design as well as their long life cycle. Each class of components involved in the multi-indenture structure of such products requires a different recovery process. Moreover, due to their long life cycle, the return flows are of various quality levels. In this article, we study a closed-loop supply chain in the context of durable products with generic modular structures. To this end, we propose a mixed-integer programming model based on a generic disassembly tree where the number of each sub-assembly depends on the quality status of the return stream. The model determines the location of various types of facilities in the reverse network while coordinating forward and reverse flows. We also consider the legislative target for the recovery of used products as a constraint in the problem formulation. We present a Benders decomposition-based solution algorithm together with several algorithmic enhancements for this problem. Computational results illustrate the superior performance of the solution method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Landfilling of End-Of-Life (EOL) durable products that contain large quantities of precious and depletable raw materials is a major concern in terms of sustainability and environmental footprints. In recent decades, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in several countries, such as Germany and Japan, have been facing with legislations on the take-back of their EOL products. Meanwhile, they have started recognizing the product recovery as an opportunity for saving production costs through reusing the recovered parts in their forward flow in addition to having access to the secondary markets. Hence, the OEMs have been forced to extend the scope of traditional logistics to incorporate the return flows from customers to manufacturer. As pointed out by Guide and Van Wassenhove (2002), OEMs that have been most successful with their reverse supply chains are those that closely coordinate it with the forward supply chain, initiating the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). In a CLSC, the role of the reverse supply chain (RSC) is to collect used products from end-users, inspect and sort them as needed, ship them to various recovery facilities, and finally redistribute the recovered items into the forward supply chain or to the secondary markets.

This study is motivated by the recovery of durable products, such as aircraft, automobile, and large household appliances that are distinguished by their multi-indenture structure as well as their long life cycle. Such products can be disassembled into several components namely modules, parts, and precious raw materials. As opposed to simple waste, e.g., paper, carpet, and sand, that can only be recycled, each of the aforementioned components in the disassembly tree of durable products can be recovered by a particular recovery process. In the context of durable products with long life cycle, it can be expected that the majority of the return stream is composed of poor quality returns with a small number of recoverable modules and parts (Krikke, Bloemhof-Ruwaard, & Van Wassenhove, 2003). In other words, only a small portion of the return flows might belong to the warranty or damaged items involving a large number of high quality modules and parts. Since the remanufacturing cost increases as the quality of returns decrease, OEMs expect larger revenue through the recovery of high quality returns and thus might be less motivated for the acquisition and recovery of lower quality ones. However, the legislation, e.g., in Europe and Japan, sets targets for the recovery of used products. Failure to meet this target would incur penalties to the OEM and it has a negative impact on the image of the company from customers’ point of view.

The existing CLSC network design models in the literature cover only a few recovery options, such as product remanufacturing and material recycling. In an attempt to fill the gap in the current literature on the design of CLSC networks, this paper proposes a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model which formulates CLSC network design for the case of used durable products based on a generic disassembly tree. In addition to the location of collection, disassembly, and disposal facilities, the model will also decide on the location of a variety of recovery facilities such as remanufacturing, bulk recycling, and material recycling designated for each class of components of durable products.

Moreover, the variable quality status of the return stream has been incorporated in the structure of the aforementioned disassembly tree. More specifically, we assume that the return stream fits into various quality levels; warranty or damaged returns are usually categorized as the high quality stream, while EOL items are assigned to the poor quality stream. To the best of our knowledge, the issue of non-homogeneous quality of the components in the disassembly tree of complex structured products which affects the right choice of the recovery option has never been addressed in the CLSC design literature. As another contribution, we have also considered the legislative target imposed to OEMs for the recovery of returns in order to address environmental concerns regarding the harmful effects of leaving used products in the environment.

On account of the fact that the proposed MIP model is among the most large-scale CLSC network design models particularly due to various types of recovery facilities in the reverse network as well as the comprehensive generic disassembly tree, we have developed an efficient solution method based on Benders decomposition (Benders, 1962). Regarding that the previous studies in the context of CLSC and RSC design have addressed less complicated networks, their Benders decomposition algorithmic schemes are limited to the generation of multiple optimality cuts, cut strengthening, and introducing the trust region restriction to the master problem (Pishvaee, Razmi, & Torabi, 2014; Üster, Easwaran, Akçali, & Cetinkaya, 2007). We, however, deploy a variety of enhancements including: (1) Adding valid inequalities to the master problem to reduce the number of feasibility cuts; (2) Generating enhanced Pareto-optimal cuts to exclude a larger space of the master problem; and (3) Specializing the local branching search to the proposed CLSC design model to concurrently improve both lower and upper bounds during the execution of Benders decomposition. Local branching as a neighborhood search algorithm offers a general search strategy that might be adapted to the type of problem being solved. It should be emphasized that we have adapted the local branching scheme described in the seminal work of Fischetti and Lodi (2003) to the type of our problem of interest in the case of Benders decomposition to dramatically improve the convergence of the algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine the enhanced Pareto-optimality cuts of Papadakos (2008) with the local branching within Benders decomposition algorithm.

In summary, the main contribution of our study is twofold. Firstly, we formulate a CLSC network design problem based on a generic disassembly tree corresponding to durable products with non-homogeneous quality status. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the most generic CLSC strategic planning model in the sense that it involves all recovery options plausible in taking different sub-assemblies of a product while also considering legislative recovery target as an environmental goal. Secondly, we propose an exact solution algorithm based on Benders decomposition in conjunction with several computational enhancements such as improved Pareto-optimality cuts and local branching.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide the overview of the most relevant literature. In Section 3, we provide more details on the problem investigated in this paper and then present its formulation. Section 4 describes the solution methodology. Computational experiments are presented in Section 5. Conclusion and future areas of research are provided in Section 6.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

In this section, we present a selective overview of the relevant literature on CLSC and RSC network design. For a detailed review, the interested reader is referred to Akçalı, Çetinkaya, and Üster (2009); Aras, Boyaci, and Verter (2010); Govindan, Soleimani, and Kannan (2014). We also provide a review of the relevant existing algorithmic refinements for Benders decomposition method.

As an early study, Fleischmann, Beullens, Bloemhof-Ruwaard, and Wassenhove (2001) proposed a MIP model for designing a generic CLSC network including uncapacitated disassembly and remanufacturing facilities in the reverse channel. Krikke et al. (2003) proposed a multi-objective CLSC network design in which the objective is to minimize cost and environmental impacts measured by energy and waste. Lu and Bostel (2007) provided a MIP formulation to address a CLSC where the customers are directly served from hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing facilities. For solving the problem, the authors developed a Lagrangian heuristic approach.

The multi-product CLSCs have been studied by Demirel and Gökçen (2008); Jayaraman, Guide, and Srivastava (1999); Min and Ko (2008); Soleimani, Seyyed-Esfahani, and Shirazi (2013); Üster et al. (2007). For instance, Min and Ko (2008) focused on the design of a CLSC network in which a third-party logistics (3PL) provider runs the reverse channel. The resulting model was solved by means of a genetic algorithm. More recently, Alumur, Nickel, Saldanha-da Gama, and Verter (2012) presented a multi-product formulation for RSC network design while considering the reverse bill-of-material. The proposed model was applied for a case study of washing machines and tumble dryers in Germany.


                        Listeş (2007) proposed a two-stage stochastic programming model for designing a CLSC network under demand and return uncertainty. The proposed model was solved by the integer L-shaped algorithm. Salema, Barbosa-Povoa, and Novais (2007) addressed the problem of designing a CLSC network in which random demand and quantity of returns are modeled as discrete scenarios with known probability distribution. For more recent papers on CLSC network design under uncertainty, the reader is referred to Cardoso, Barbosa-Póvoa, and Relvas (2013); Zeballos, Méndez, Barbosa-Povoa, and Novais (2014).

Quality status of used products has been considered by Aras, Aksen, and Gönül Tanuğur (2008). The authors addressed a RSC network design problem in which used products are characterized with respect to different quality levels. A tabu search-simplex search method was developed as the solution approach. Likewise, a quality-dependent incentive policy for the collection of used items was presented in Aras and Aksen (2008).

The classification of the contributions mentioned above is provided in Table 1
                        . Columns 2–7 refer to location decisions in the CLSC and RSC network under investigation. Columns 4–7, in particular, indicate the type(s) of recovery options that have been considered in those articles. Column 8 verifies whether or not the recovery network design model is formulated based on a disassembly tree (reverse bill-of-material). Columns 9 and 10 indicate, respectively, if the variable quality status of the return stream and the environmental concern have been taken into consideration while designing the network. The last column represents the solution approach adopted. The overview of the existing literature reveals the extent to which the model we propose in this article goes beyond the literature. Only a few models address the multi-indenture structure of durable products and hence formulate the CLSC/RSC design problem based on a disassembly tree. Furthermore, none of those articles considered all disposition processes plausible for various types of dismantled components in such products as well as the recovery target as an environmental goal. Likewise, variable quality of the return stream and consequently its impact on the remanufacturing cost has been rarely investigated in the CLSC/RSC network design problem. On the methodological side, compared to Benders decomposition-based approaches applied in previous studies, the complex structure of the CLSC considered in this article requires developing a more sophisticated method to solve the resulting MIP model.

Benders decomposition is an exact solution method in which the variables of a MIP model are partitioned into two subsets such that when the integer variables are assigned numerical values, the problem reduces to a linear program. This procedure partitions the original mixed-integer programming model into a master problem and a linear subproblem referred to as the slave problem. These subproblems are then solved sequentially and iteratively until a termination criterion, such as a small gap, is satisfied.

Benders decomposition-based approaches have been widely used in solving supply chain network design problems: e.g., (i) Multi-commodity distribution system design (Geoffrion & Graves, 1974), (ii) Stochastic supply chain design (Oliveira, Grossmann, & Hamacher, 2014; Santoso, Ahmed, Goetschalckx, & Shapiro, 2005), and (iii) Closed-loop supply chains (Pishvaee et al., 2014; Üster et al., 2007). Over the years, since the pioneering paper of Geoffrion and Graves (1974) in which the authors demonstrated that the master problem does not need to be solved to optimality, various techniques have been proposed to enhance the performance of Benders decomposition. The focus of the research has been mainly on circumventing the computational difficulty of the master problem, developing new cut selection schemes, and incorporating additional algorithmic features into the classical Benders algorithm.


                        McDaniel and Devine (1977) suggested the relaxation of the integrality constraints in the master problem to obtain a set of initial optimality cuts and later on reintroduce them to the master problem and generate additional cuts until an optimal integer solution is found. As for cut selection schemes, Magnanti and Wong (1981) discussed how to generate Pareto-optimal cuts considering the notion of core points when there are multiple optimal solutions to the dual subproblem. Despite the fact that more than one dual subproblem is solved at each iteration, the proposed scheme proved to be quite efficient for solving network design type problems. Nonetheless, this approach suffers from two major drawbacks: (1) The normalization constraint added to the auxiliary dual subproblem is numerically unstable (Fischetti, Salvagnin, & Zanette, 2008); and (2) The dual subproblem is required to be bounded. In other words, this approach cannot be employed to enrich feasibility cuts. In order to resolve the first issue, Papadakos (2008) demonstrated that, through a different core point choice at each iteration, the normalization constraint can be disregarded in the auxiliary dual subproblem. Moreover, the author showed that the convex combination of the current master problem solution and the previous core point suffices to obtain a new core point. On account of the fact that the dual subproblem can be transformed into a pure feasibility problem, Fischetti et al. (2008) addressed both feasibility and optimality cuts in a unified framework. The aim is to identify the “minimal source of infeasibility” and consequently to find the small set of constraints that would be sufficient to exclude the master problem solution. More recently, Sherali and Lunday (2013) proposed the idea of generating maximal non-dominated cuts to speed up the Benders algorithm. As an algorithmic add-on, Rei, Cordeau, Gendreau, and Soriano (2009) recently proposed to apply local branching (Fischetti & Lodi, 2003) throughout the solution process to improve both lower and upper bounds simultaneously and accordingly accelerate Benders decomposition algorithm.

As pointed out in the preceding sections, durable products have a multi-indenture structure. They consist of multiple and various types of components as shown in the disassembly tree in Fig. 1
                        . Once the durable product is dismantled, it yields various modules, parts, residues, solid raw materials, in addition to non-recoverable components. Modules, e.g., washing machine motor and clutch, are units of products that undergo the remanufacturing processes. In this study we assume that modules are brought up to the brand-new status through the remanufacturing processes. We also assume that poor quality modules can be recovered through bulk recycling. Parts, e.g., washing tube or Printed Circuit Board (PCB) in a washing machine, are another category of components in the disassembly process. It is also assumed that each product yields different numbers of a specific part depending on its quality level. If parts are not qualified for harvesting, they would undergo the bulk recycling processes. Solid raw materials in the product, such as plastic, iron, and copper are separated after the product is dismantled. Such materials can directly undergo the appropriate recycling processes. Nevertheless, a big fraction of materials might be combined with other residues and thus it is not easy to extract them through simple activities in material recycling units. Bulk recycling is the appropriate recovery option for such residues. It encompasses shredding and different separation methods that first transform the residues into flakes and then separate different categories of materials based on their physical properties. Components with no value are salvaged (e.g., landfilling and incineration).

In the CLSC network under consideration, the OEM manages an established forward supply chain including suppliers, manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and end-users. The brand-new durable products are shipped from manufacturing facilities to end-users through distribution centers to meet the demand. In the reverse chain, used products with different quality levels are acquired by collection centers. In disassembly centers, used products are dismantled considering the disassembly tree and consequently each component will be processed in the appropriate recovery facility. The recovered components can then be: (i) delivered to manufacturing facilities to deploy in manufacturing processes, and (ii) offered at secondary markets. Given the above description, the conceptual structure of the CLSC is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2
                        . The solid arcs indicate the forward flows while the dashed ones denote the reverse flows in the CLSC under consideration.

Given the network configuration provided in Section 3.2, the CLSC design model is looking for (i) the location of collection, disassembly, remanufacturing, bulk recycling, material recycling, and disposal facilities in the reverse network, and (ii) routing/coordinating the forward and reverse flows. The objective function of the proposed MIP model is to maximize the net profit which incorporates the revenue from selling new products and recovered components in addition to the fixed opening costs of facilities as well as processing procurement, and transportation costs in the network. The proposed mathematical model is subjected to the following major restrictions.

                           
                              •
                              Demand satisfaction constraints for brand-new products and recovered items,

Flow balance constraints at different facilities,

Capacity limitations of facilities,

Non-negativity and binary restrictions on decision variables.

Furthermore, according to legislative regulations, the company is obliged to acquire a substantial portion of the return stream for recovery purposes. This condition reflects the environmental concerns regarding the harmful effects of leaving used durable products in the environment. It should be noted manufacturers might not be willing to invest on the recovery of low profitable poor quality returns due to their small salvage value. However, through imposing this condition as a constraint to the CLSC design model, we can ensure that poor quality returns are also treated in the reverse network. This constraint has been called “the environmentally friendly constraint” provided as constraint (13) in the following model.

The following assumptions support the MIP model provided in this section:

Constraints (6)–(8) ensure that the total outgoing flow from each manufacturing center is equal to the total incoming flow into this facility from suppliers and reverse network. Constraints (9) and (10) ensure flow balance at each distribution center as well as demand satisfaction at each end-user zone. Constraint (11) ensures that all the returned products are collected at the collection centers. Constraint (12) ensures that the sum of the flow to the disassembly facilities, i.e., acquired returns, cannot exceed the total amount of returned products available in collection centers. Constraint (13) is the environmentally friendly restriction imposing that the total amount of acquired returns must be at least equal to a certain percentage of the total amount of the return stream in collection centers. Constraints (14)–(19) ensure flow conservation at each disassembly center and demand satisfaction at spare parts markets. Constrain (20) ensures that the total incoming flow to each remanufacturing center is equal to the total outgoing flow to modules secondary markets and manufacturing facilities. Constraint (21) ensures that the demands of all secondary markets for remanufactured modules are satisfied. Constraints (22) and (23) ensure flow conservation at each bulk recycling center. Constraints (24)–(26) are flow conservation restrictions at each material recycling center. Constraints (27)–(31) impose capacity restrictions on forward chain facilities. Constraints (32)–(37) ensure that the total incoming flow to an open facility in the reverse network cannot exceed its capacity.

The proposed model (1)–(37) has a conspicuous special property that facilitates the application of Benders decomposition as the solution method (Geoffrion & Graves, 1974). For a given vector of locations of reverse chain facilities, the remaining problem is a network type problem which can be solved much easier than the MIP model. In what follows, we present the details of the Benders reformulation of the MIP model along with the proposed algorithmic enhancements.

For the sake of simplicity, let P be the vector of unit prices of selling brand-new and recovered components at the marketplaces. Let F be the vector of fixed costs of opening facilities in the reverse network. Furthermore, let C be the vector of other types of costs and let 
                           QX
                         be the set of forward and reverse flows variables. Let 
                           Y
                         be the set of binary decision variables representing, respectively, the locations of collection, disassembly, remanufacturing, bulk recycling, material recycling, and disposal centers. Furthermore, let 
                           
                              
                                 Y

                         denote the vector of fixed 
                           Y
                        . The resulting primal subproblem (PSP) that determines the routing of the forward and reverse flows can be stated as follows.

                         are, respectively, associated with constraints (27)–(31) and (38)–(43). Besides, Δ indicates the polyhedron defined by the constraints of the DSP. If Δ is empty, the DSP is infeasible and according to duality theory in linear programming, the PSP is either infeasible or unbounded. However, the proposed MIP model is not unbounded. Let π( · ) represent the part of the dual subproblem objective function (44) which is independent of the location variables. Introducing an extra variable Γ, we can formulate the master problem (MP) that determines the CLSC network configuration as follows.

                         and Δr
                         represent the sets of extreme points and extreme rays of Δ, respectively. Moreover, let V denote the capacities of several types of facilities in constraints (32)–(37) including collection, disassembly, remanufacturing, bulk recycling, material recycling, and disposal centers. The compact representation of the MP can be stated as follows.

                        Observe that the polyhedron Δ might have a vast number of extreme points and rays. An efficient iterative algorithm is to dynamically generate only a subset of optimality and feasibility cuts. This approach is very effective since only a subset of these cuts will be active for the MP and most of them are redundant. Starting from empty subsets of extreme points and rays, each iteration of the algorithm first solves the MP. It provides an updated upper bound on the optimal solution of MIP. Then, the DSP is solved using the solution of the MP. If it is bounded, an optimal solution corresponds to an extreme point of Δp
                         is identified and the optimality cut (51) is introduced to the MP. Otherwise, the feasibility cut (52) associated with an extreme ray of Δr
                         is added to the MP.

As Benders decomposition is known to be a method which converges quite slowly (Geoffrion & Graves, 1974), we provide various algorithmic enhancements in order to accelerate the solution algorithm.

Considering the structure of the MIP model, we can introduce the following valid inequalities to the MP to restrict its feasible region. These cuts give useful information concerning the subproblem to MP and thus help it to find a better network configuration particularly at early iterations of the Benders algorithm. Therefore, we can expect that the presence of the valid inequalities reduces the number of feasibility cuts (52) during the execution of the solution process.

                           Constraints (54) and (55) ensure that the selected collection and disassembly centers provide enough capacity to acquire returns. Constraints (56) and (57) ensure enough capacity for satisfying the demands of recovered components at their corresponding secondary markets through opening adequate recovery facilities. According to constraints (58) and (59), at least one bulk recycling and one disposal center must be opened in the CLSC network.

As the PSP is usually degenerate due to its typical network structure, the DSP might have multiple optimal solutions (Magnanti & Wong, 1981). Hence, several valid optimality cuts of different strength associated to the set of alternative optimal solutions can be generated. Given the dominating cut definition (Magnanti & Wong, 1981), the optimal cut corresponds to the dual solution vectors

                            and Δ indicates the polyhedron defined by the constraints of the DSP. As mentioned earlier, the normalization constraint (61) might be quite dense and numerically unstable. Nonetheless, Papadakos (2008) demonstrated that this constraint can be omitted through choosing a different core point on the objective function (61) every time the Pareto-optimal cut generation step is executed. It was also showed that any convex combination of the current master problem solution and an initial core point suffices to obtain a valid core point (Papadakos, 2008, Theorem 8). The modified auxiliary dual subproblem can then be restated as follows.

                            and Δ indicates the polyhedron defined by the constraints of the DSP. The optimal solution to (63) is used to generate an optimality cut, which is a Pareto-optimal one in the ri(YLP
                           ). It should be noted that since the description of the convex hull of Y is not available a priori and also finding a core point in the convex hull is difficult, Pareto-optimal cuts would be generated using 
                              Y0
                              
                            ∈ ri(YLP
                           ). Such optimality cuts are non-dominated ones in YLP
                           . We refer to this accelerated Benders decomposition-based algorithm as “BD1” described in Algorithm 1
                           . It should be emphasized that λc
                            denotes the non-negative parameter to be used in the convex combination that updates the core point throughout the solution process for generating the Pareto-optimality cuts. It has been shown in the literature (see, e.g. Papadakos, 2008; 2009) that 0.5 is a suitable choice for this parameter that gives the best results in most of cases. Hence, we use the same value in our algorithms.

Pilot computational tests have shown that although the Pareto-optimal cuts enhance the performance of the classical Benders decomposition algorithm, the upper bound still slowly decreases throughout the solution process. Therefore, we consider the incorporation of local branching cuts (Fischetti & Lodi, 2003; Rei et al., 2009) throughout “BD1”. Given a feasible reference point of an integer programming model, the main idea of local branching is to divide the feasible space of the problem into a series of smaller subproblems which can be solved by any appropriate generic solver. Therefore, one might be able to identify a better feasible solution in the neighborhood of the reference point within an acceptable computational time. In the context of Benders decomposition, each time the local branching search is executed, we may find better lower bounds as well as multiple optimality cuts that naturally lead to improved lower and upper bounds. We proceed with a detailed discussion of the local branching procedure.

The local branching is performed once the solution to the MP yields a feasible PSP, i.e., the DSP is bounded and optimal. We use this feasible solution as a reference point to create local branching subproblems. Let

                            be an optimal solution to the MP. Introducing the following disjunction, we can divide the feasible region of the MIP model (1)–(37) into two reduced subproblems.

                           . We proceed the local branching search through solving the new local branching subproblem.

Case 4: If the time limit exceeds without improvement in the value of the objective function of the current local branching subproblem, the right-hand side of the left branching constraint will be decreased by “1” and the tabu cut will also be added to the current subproblem to eliminate 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       Y
                                       ¯
                                    
                                 
                                 2
                              
                            from further consideration. The current subproblem will then be resolved in an attempt to find a better solution. In case no improved solution is found even in this new reduced neighborhood, the diversification procedure (div.) will be applied by enlarging the size of the feasible region by “1”.

In addition, the tabu constraint is imposed at the beginning of the execution of the local branching procedure in order to exclude the solution to the current MP from further exploration.

The branching scheme is repeated through iterations of “BD1” until a specified number of local branching subproblems or diversifications will be satisfied. We remark that since local branching subproblems created by adding neighborhood constraints to MIP are quite hard to solve, the MIP model is only used in two iterations of the Benders algorithm to define the local branching subproblems, namely “MIP phase”. As for the rest of iterations of the Benders algorithm, local branching subproblems are created by adding the neighborhood constraints to the MP, namely “MP phase”. After each call to local branching procedure, several new feasible solutions, if any, are identified. They can be used to create a pool of optimality cuts (51), which will then be added to the MP to improve the quality of upper bound. This local branching-based Benders decomposition algorithm as described in Algorithm 2
                            is referred to as “BD2”. The local branching procedure is also outlined in Algorithm 3
                           . In this algorithm, the feasible solution to the local branching subproblems, when the first and the third cases arise, would be stored in 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       QX
                                       ¯
                                    
                                 
                                 h
                              
                            and

                                 h
                              
                            indicating, respectively, the CLSC network flows and locations. At the end of each local branching procedure, we obtain a lower (upper) bound through evaluating the objective function of MIP (MP) regarding these feasible solutions.

We evaluate the tractability of the proposed model and the performance of the accelerated Benders decomposition-based algorithm for a case of large household appliances, i.e., used washing machines, inspired by Alumur et al. (2012) and Park, Tahara, Jeong, and Lee (2006). The concerned washing machines consist of two modules, ten parts, and three types of solid materials. Table 2
                      presents the disassembly tree of a returned washing machine. The next section describes test instances settings and then it is followed by a summary of computational results.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

We assume three quality
                        
                         levels, namely, poor, medium, and high for the return stream. Demands of the brand-new washing machines and remanufactured modules are selected at random from {600, 601, 602, …, 1000} and {50, 51, 52, …, 150}, respectively. Demands of spare parts and recycled raw materials are also randomly determined from {30, 31, 32, …, 100}. Capacities of facilities in the forward network are randomly generated following a reasonable relationship with the disassembly tree and demands of end-users. Capacities of reverse network facilitates are also randomly generated considering end-users and secondary markets demands as well as return ratios and recovery coefficients. Denote by “U” the uniform distribution, shipping costs are considered to be U(5, 10) for each washing machine and U(1, 4) for each unit of components. Other parameters are generated as summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Note that fixed costs of opening facilities in the reverse network are generated considering the capacity of facilities. More specifically, the higher the capacity of a facility, the larger infrastructural cost it will require.

We also consider seven major classes within each three different test instances as shown in Table 5. These test instances vary according to the number of CLSC facilities as well as the number of the first and secondary markets. All 21 test instances have been randomly generated from the uniformly distributed demand, return ratio, and various parameters provided in Tables 3 and 4 through Monte Carlo sampling method. It should also be emphasized that we have chosen the bounds of most of the MIP model parameters based on the current literature of CLSC/RSC network design (Alumur et al., 2012; Listeş, 2007; Üster et al., 2007) to ensure the stability of the generated test instances. Table 6 presents the number of constraints and variables, including binary and continuous ones, in each problem set.

The proposed algorithmic scheme was implemented in C++ using Concert Technology with IBM-ILOG CPLEX 12.51. All the experiments were conducted on an Intel Pentium 1.90 gigahertz machine with 4 gigabyte RAM. The relative optimality gap, i.e., 
                           
                              ϵ
                              =
                              1
                           
                         percent, as well as a maximum time of 3600 seconds were imposed as the stopping criteria for both “BD1” and “BD2”. Furthermore, all 21 test instances were solved by CPLEX 12.51 in a maximum time limit of 7200 seconds and within the stopping gap tolerance of 1 percent. Table 7
                         includes the value of the local branching parameters, such as the number of local branching subproblems (Sub.) to be solved at each iteration of “BD2”, the maximum number of diversifications (Ndiv.), time limit for solving each local branching subproblem (Time), the value of κv
                        , and the optimality gap 
                           
                              ϵ
                              
                                 κ
                                 v
                              
                           
                         percent each time this procedure is called in both phases of “MIP” and “MP”.


                        Table 8
                         summarizes the computational statistics obtained after solving each test instance with “BD1”, “BD2”, and CPLEX. In this table, the resolution time in seconds (Time), the number of iterations (Iter.), and the value of the profit objective function are reported for both algorithms. Column “GAP” under “BD1” represents the relative difference between lower and upper bounds within the dedicated time limit, i.e., 1 hour. We also present the CPU time in seconds in addition to the profit reported by CPLEX after 7200 seconds. It should be stated that we have also examined the performance of the classical Benders decomposition method as well as the accelerated Benders algorithm described in Sherali and Lunday (2013) on our test problems. However, neither the computational statistics of the former nor the latter have not been presented in Table 8 due to their poor performances. The most important findings concerning Table 8 are summarized as follows.

                           
                              –
                              CPLEX is only able to find the optimal solution of the test instances of the first and the second problem sets indicated by asterisk symbol in the last column. However, it fails to solve the test instances of other sets to optimality within the dedicated time limit and gap tolerance. The best value of the objective function, i.e., profit, obtained by CPLEX after 2 hours when applied to solve other sets is also reported in the last column.

“BD1” demonstrates better performance in terms of CPU time, i.e., on average, four times faster than “BD2” only in solving the test instances of the first problem set. However, “BD2” implementation reduces the number of iterations, on average, 2.5 times. This algorithm also indicates an improved convergence behavior when applied to solve the test instances of the second set. In particular, “BD2” is on average 1.4 times faster than “BD1” in terms of running time. Moreover, the average number of iterations during “BD2” execution is 3 times smaller than that of “BD1”.

As for the other five sets, “BD1” is unable to solve the test instances to optimality even in 1 hour. Columns GAP and profit indicate, respectively, the relative difference between the lower and upper bounds and the value of the objective function obtained by “BD1” after 1 hour. However, “BD2” solves all test instances within the allotted optimality gap of 1 percent in considerably smaller number of iterations. Note that the average relative gap between profit values reported by “BD2” and CPLEX for the test instances of the last five sets is 1.82 percent. It indicates the extent to which the best feasible solution obtained by CPLEX within 2 hours is far from the optimal solution identified by “BD2”. The average solution time of “BD2” is 18 minutes when applied to solve the test instances of problem sets 3 to 6. In addition, the average solution time of “BD2” is 42 minutes in solving the test instances of the last set, i.e., the largest set (see Fig. 3).

The average number of iterations when solving each problem set with both decomposition algorithms is illustrated in Fig. 4. In summary, it can be observed that local branching search considerably improves the performance of Benders decomposition algorithm.

Recall that the costly regulatory restrictions are forcing OEMs on taking back of a certain percentage of the return stream. It, therefore, imposes the environmentally friendly constraint (13) in the CLSC network design model. We investigate the impact of the recovery target θ on the amount of the acquisition in disassembly centers. To this end, we use three values, 0.70 (the base case model), 0.77, and 0.80, as the recovery target levels. We also consider problem sets 1, 4, and 7, respectively, as small-, medium-, and large-sized networks and then choose one test instance from each problem set. These test instances vary in the total amount of end-user demands and the total quantity of returns in addition to the network size.

As expected, the
                         OEM favors the recovery of high quality returns due to their profitability, i.e., the total amount of the high quality returns is acquired in disassembly centers by the OEM in all three levels of the recovery target. Likewise, 100 percent of medium quality return stream is treated in the reverse network. However, the company is not willing to use all of potential recovery capacities to take back the poor quality return flows due to their low profitability. As shown in Fig. 5
                        , in the base case model, 41 percent, 44 percent, and 40 percent of poor quality returns are desirable for recovery processes, respectively, for the small-, medium-, and large-sized network. As the legislation requires more restrictive recovery targets, the OEM is forced to take a larger amount of poor quality returns. We can see from Fig. 5 that the acquisition amount of poor quality returns significantly increases for each instance in accordance with the change in the recovery target. For example, with a target level of 0.80, the return acquisition reaches the value of 80 percent for the medium-sized network.

We also analyze the sensitivity of the objective function CLSC profit to changes in the recovery target through considering the same test instances. For this analysis, we compare the profit of the base case model (θ = 0.70) with those of 0.77 and 0.80 as the recovery target. Fig. 6
                         illustrates profit decrease for each test instance comparing to the base case model. We observe that the profit of designing the network decreases for all concerned network sizes. For instance, the profit of designing the large-sized network decreases by 1.30 percent and 1.61 percent, respectively, in the target levels of 0.77 and 0.80. The implication is that increasing the recovery target requires installing more facilities or high capacity ones in the reverse network to process a larger amount of return flows, which incurs additional infrastructural costs. It also incurs extra processing costs at various types of facilities in the reverse channel. Observe from Fig. 6 that the profit variation in the medium-sized network is considerably greater than the other test instances. This can be explained by the fact that in the large-sized network the revenue from the forward channel is remarkably higher than the infrastructural cost in the reverse channel. Therefore, the profit slightly decreases with higher levels of the recovery target. In a similar manner, since the total quantity of returns in the small-sized network is quite low, the costs of installing new facilities in the reverse channel has less impact on the profit compared to the medium-sized network.

Another observation to be made concerns the impact of the recovery target on the design of the CLSC. As shown above, with higher levels of the recovery target, more poor quality flow is sent to disassembly centers, which affects the configuration of the CLSC network and thus the total profit. Considering the disassembly tree, the viable recovery process of the additional poor quality components is to install high capacity and costly bulk recycling centers and consequently material recycling, and disposal facilities in the reverse network. One practical alternative for the OEM is outsourcing the bulk recycling processes to a third-party logistics provider. In this way, the OEM also avoids installing extra material recycling and disposal centers for processing the additional amount of poor quality returns under new regulations.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this article, we addressed a CLSC network design problem which is applicable in the context of durable products. We considered several features of practical relevance namely, a generic disassembly tree, all types of recovery processes plausible for each product component, the legislative recovery target, in addition to the non-homogeneity in the quality state of the return stream. Due to the generic features of the disassembly tree under discussion, the proposed model is not limited to applications for specific industries. It can also give some insight to decision makers how to design a CLSC with comprehensive recovery options.

In order to solve such a large-scale optimization problem, we developed two different variants of Benders decomposition algorithm, namely “BD1”, and “BD2”. The former only takes advantage of generating Pareto-optimal cuts while the latter incorporates local branching search into the solution process. The performance of both methods were compared with CPLEX on a set of twenty-one test instances. As shown by the computational results, both solution algorithms outperformed CPLEX. When a comparison was made between two variants, “BD1” could only solve six test instances. However, “BD2” was able to solve all test instances to optimality in a reasonable amount of time. Particularly, the average number of iterations during the execution of “BD2” is 4 times smaller than that of “BD1”. The improved convergence behavior of “BD2” is mainly due to efforts devoted to the local branching phases.

Many OEMs most often design and manufacture a family of products (e.g., LG and Samsung). This common practice in industry leads to introduce a comprehensive recovery system that can be readily generalizable to a family of products or equivalently a CLSC in a multi-product setting. Moreover, the dynamic nature of the CLSC network design problem which is mainly due to fluctuations/uncertainty in demand and quantity of returns over a planning horizon might not be often neglected. In this regard, multi-stage stochastic programming approach and modular capacity facilities could be the right approaches to be adopted. Hence, a natural extension of the current study would be to extend the proposed model into a multi-period setting. Furthermore, offering incentives to customers in order to encourage them to return used durable products prior to reaching their end-of-life would be another interesting area to investigate. Such incentives that can be offered in form of discounts on future purchases to customers would increase the percentage of high quality level returns. It should be mentioned that we are currently extending this work to incorporate the random quality state of used durable products into the proposed model and to solve the resulting large-scale stochastic problem through developing efficient algorithms. Application of the proposed model and solution methodology to a real industrial case would also be an interesting extension of the current study.
