                  CRTh2 receptor is an important mediator of inflammatory effects and has attracted much attention as a therapeutic target for the treatment of conditions such as asthma, COPD, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. In pursuit of better CRTh2 receptor antagonist agents, 3D-QSAR studies were performed on a series of 2-(2-(benzylthio)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl) acetic acids. There is no crystal structure information available on this protein; hence in this work, ligand-based comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) were performed by atom by atom matching alignment using systematic search and simulated annealing methods. The 3D-QSAR models were generated with 10 different combinations of test and training set molecules, since the robustness and predictive ability of the model is very important. We have generated 20 models for CoMFA and 100 models for CoMSIA based on two different alignments. Each model was validated with statistical cut off values such as q
                     2
                     >0.4, r

                     >0.5 and r

                     pred
                     >0.5. Based on better q

                     2
                     pred values, the best predictions were obtained for the CoMFA (model 5 q
                     2
                     =0.488, r

                     pred
                     =0.732), and CoMSIA (model 45 q

                     =0.525, r

                     pred
                     =0.883) from systematic search conformation alignment. The high correlation between the cross-validated/predicted and experimental activities of a test set revealed that the CoMFA and CoMSIA models were robust. Statistical parameters from the generated QSAR models indicated the data is well fitted and have high predictive ability. The generated models suggest that steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, H-bond donor and acceptor parameters are important for activity. Our study serves as a guide for further experimental investigations on the synthesis of new CRTh2 antagonist.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTh2) is a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a recognized role in initiation and perpetuation of allergic diseases (Pettipher and Whittaker, 2012; Shimono et al., 2012; Pothier et al., 2012; Birkinshaw et al., 2006; Bonafoux et al., 2011; Hirai et al., 2001; Nagata et al., 1999a; Gervais et al., 2011; Schroder et al., 2012). CRTh2 is selectively expressed by Th2 cells, eosinophils, and basophils and mediates chemotactic activation of these cells in response to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) (Pettipher and Whittaker, 2012; Nagata et al., 1999b; Iwasaki et al., 2002; Uller et al., 2007; Sykes et al., 2012) which is produced in high quantities by mast cells during allergic attacks (Birkinshaw et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2004; Takeshita et al., 2004; Pettipher, 2008). PGD2 exhibit its biological responses by activating the classical DP1 receptor and CRTh2 receptor (also known as DP2) which is linked to different signalling pathways and it negatively regulates adenylyl cyclases and stimulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinases and phospholipase C (Hata et al., 2005; Hata et al., 2005; Jain et al., 2008; Nagata and Hirai, 2003; Mathiesen et al., 2005; Hata and Breyer, 2004 
                     Nagata and Hirai, 2003; Mathiesen et al., 2005; Hata and Breyer, 2004). To date, CRTh2 is the only receptor that links a major lipid mediator of mast cells with Th2 cells, eosinophils, and basophils (Nagata and Hirai, 2003). There has been a dramatic increase in the number of published articles and patents describing the identification and optimization of potent CRTh2 antagonists in recent years (Ulven and Kostenis, 2010). It has been suggested that antagonizing selectively the CRTh2 receptor could be useful in the treatment of asthma and other inflammatory diseases (Pothier et al., 2012). CRTh2 antagonists had a very strong preference for a carboxylic acid moiety (Pettipher and Whittaker, 2012) and have variety of fused 6–5-membered ring chemotypes as a core structure such as indole, azaindole, benzimidazole, indolizine, spiro–indoline (Shimono et al., 2012). Ramatroban a drug currently used for treatment of allergic rhinitis also possess CRTh2 antagonist activity (Pettipher and Whittaker, 2012; Shimono et al., 2012; Hata et al., 2005; Hata and Breyer, 2004). More recently, an orally bioavailable CRTh2 antagonist (OC000459) successfully completed Phase IIa trials demonstrating efficacy in asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (Bonafoux et al., 2011). These suggest that CRTh2 antagonist is a potential therapy in allergic and inflammatory disorders.

When 3D structure of the macromolecular target is not available 3D-QSAR is the prominent computational means to support chemistry within drug design projects (Puzyn et al., 2010). The primary objective of 3D QSAR was to understand which properties are important to control a specific biological activity of a series of compounds. The most popular methods are CoMFA and CoMSIA which correlate biological activity with the molecular features (Jain et al., 2008; Doweyko, 2004). Hence, in the present study, ligand-based CoMFA and CoMSIA were performed on a series of 2-(2-(benzylthio)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl) acetic acids. The selected series satisfies the key requirement of CRTh2 antagonist and have similar structural features to indomethacin which is reported potent agonist for the development of CRTh2 antagonist. The majority of currently available CRTh2 antagonists (Shimono et al., 2012; Birkinshaw et al., 2006; Ulven et al., 2007; Sandham et al., 2009; Tumey et al., 2010; Gallant et al., 2011) have the core structures of indole acetic acid but the series used in our study alone replaces the indole acetic acid by imidazole acetic acid which paves the way for the discovery of novel antagonist against CRTh2. In addition, the compounds have sulfur atom attached to benzimidazole ring which makes the compound to be more potent. The highly active molecule among the dataset was selected as template and its conformation was searched through systematic search and simulated annealing methods. The bioactive conformations using two search methods were taken and the common scaffold was used to align the compounds. We segregated the dataset (65 compounds) into test (15 compounds) and training (50 compounds) set. Ten different combinations of training and test set compounds were used which produced 20 CoMFA models and 100 CoMSIA models. The statistical results of the generated models were found and each model was validated with statistical cut off values such as q
                     2
                     >0.4, r
                     2
                     >0.5 and r
                     2
                     pred
                     >0.5. Based on the predictive ability (r
                     2
                     pred) of the test set the best model was chosen in CoMFA and CoMSIA analysis and it was graphically interpreted by field contribution maps. This 3D-QSAR analysis provides guidelines for the design of next-generation compounds with enhanced bioactivity or specificity and has ability to predict biological activities of novel compounds.

In this study, a dataset of 65 compounds obtained from Pothier et al. consisted of (2-(2-(benzylthio)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl acetic acids) derivatives showed inhibitory activity towards human CRTh2 receptor (Pothier et al., 2012). In a total set of 65 compounds reported, 50 compounds were used as training set and 15 compounds were used as test set based on random selection. For QSAR analysis, the given inhibitory concentration values were changed to minus logarithmic scale value (pIC50), as a dependent variable for CoMFA and CoMSIA analysis.
                           
                              pIC50
                                 =−log(IC50).
                           
                        
                     

The structures and biological activities of all compounds including both training set and test set molecules is shown in Table 1
                        .

The partial atomic charges were assigned for each ligand by utilizing Gasteiger Hückel charge, available in SYBYL X1.1 package. Since, here was no information about the bioactive conformation; the compound with the highest pIC50 value was utilized as a template molecule to perform 3D-QSAR calculations. As compound 58 was the most active, the bioactive conformations were obtained by systematic conformational search analysis and simulated annealing search. The default options were used during simulated annealing of highly active compound. During systematic conformation search all rotatable bonds were searched with incremental dihedral angle from 120° and the lowest energy conformer was assumed as bioactive conformer and was chosen for subsequent QSAR modelling. Using this particular conformer structure as standard, bioactive conformations for other compounds were determined by systematic conformer search for the additional moieties, by keeping core part constrained. In this way, the common scaffold of every inhibitor occupies the same area in three-dimensional space. The most active molecule was used as the reference to align all the compounds using atom-to-atom matching. The matching atoms were selected by maximum common substructure (MCS) as shown in Fig. 1
                        (a) and the alignment of the all molecules using systematic search conformation and simulated annealing is shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c), respectively.

CoMFA has been used widely to relate the chemical structure to their chemical and biological properties. CoMFA fields are the interaction energies between a probe atom or a molecule and a set of aligned molecules, which are used to establish the three-dimensional quantitative structure/activity relationship (3D-QSAR) equations (Hong et al., 2003). The steric and electrostatic potential fields for CoMFA were calculated at each lattice intersection of a regularly spaced grid of 2.0Å which provides all information necessary for understanding the biological properties of a set of compounds. The Van der Waals potential and columbic terms, which represent steric and electrostatic fields, respectively, were calculated using Tripos force field. The steric and electrostatic interaction energies were calculated for each molecule at each grid point using a sp3 carbon probe with a +1.0 charge. An energy cut off value of 30kcal/mol was imposed on all CoMFA calculations to avoid excessively high and unrealistic energy values within the molecule. With standard option for the scaling of variables, the regression analysis was carried out using cross-validated partial least squares approach (PLS) of LOO (leave-one-out). After that a non-cross-validated analysis was carried out without column filtering.

During calculation of the steric and electrostatic fields in CoMFA, many grid points on the molecular surface were ignored due to the rapid increase in Van der Waals repulsion. To avoid a drastic change in the potential energy of the grid points near the molecular surface, CoMSIA employed a Gaussian-type function based on distance (Zhao et al., 2011). The grid constructed for the CoMFA field calculation was also used for the CoMSIA field calculation. Five physico-chemical properties (steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond donor and acceptor) were evaluated using a common probe atom placed within a 3D grid. Different from the CoMFA, a Gaussian-type distance dependence of physicochemical properties (attenuation factor of 0.3) was assumed in the CoMSIA calculation.

In 3D-QSAR, the CoMFA and CoMSIA descriptors were used as independent variables and pIC50 values were used as the dependent variable. The partial least squares (PLS) method was used to explore a linear correlation between the CoMFA and CoMSIA fields and the biological activity values. It was performed in two stages. First, cross-validation analysis was done to determine the number of components to be used. The value of q
                        2 that resulted in a minimal number of components and the lowest cross-validated standard error of estimate was accepted. The CoMFA cutoff values were set to 30kcal/mol for both the steric and electrostatic fields, and all fields were scaled by the default options in SYBYL. Second, the optimum number of components were used to derive the final PLS model, with no validation method (Zhao et al., 2011). CoMFA and CoMSIA results were then graphically interpreted by field contribution maps.

The predictive power of CoMFA, and CoMSIA models were derived from the test set molecules, which were excluded during model development. In the structural preparation of test set molecules, sketching and optimization was same as the training set molecules. The activity of the test set was predicted by using model derived from training set. The predictive correlation coefficient for developed model was determined by using following formula:

                        pred, indicating that there is no relationship between q
                        2 and the model’s ability to predict an external test set (Puzyn et al., 2010; Puzyn et al., 2010; Doweyko, 2004).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In the present work, we have applied two methodologies, CoMFA and CoMSIA to build 3D-QSAR models. There is no crystal structure available; therefore, an indirect method i.e., a ligand-based approach is the method of choice. The highly active molecule among the dataset was selected as template and its bioactive conformation was generated using systematic search and simulated annealing. The obtained conformation was used for alignment where the common scaffold was used to align the compounds. We segregated the dataset (65 compounds) into test (15 compounds) and training set (50 compounds). Based on leave several out cross validation, 80% of the compounds were randomly selected for the generation of the model and the remaining 20% were taken as test set. It is also reported that the predictive ability of a 3D-QSAR model is strongly dependent on the structural similarity between the training and test set molecules. Test set should be chosen such that it covers the same descriptor space as utilized by the training set. This operation must be repeated numerous times in order to obtain reliable statistical results (Puzyn et al., 2010). Hence, 10 different combinations of training and test set molecules were identified. Based on these, we have generated 20 models for CoMFA analysis and by using the combinations of steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor parameters a total of 100 models was generated for CoMSIA analysis. For the generated CoMFA and CoMSIA models the statistical values like q
                     2, r
                     2, SEE, F value, r
                     2
                     pred, steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, donor and acceptor field contributions was calculated. Each model was validated with statistical cut off values such as q
                     2
                     >0.4, r
                     2
                     >0.5 and r
                     2
                     
                     pred
                     >0.5. For two different alignments, the best predictions were obtained for CoMFA model (q
                     2
                     =0.488, r
                     2
                     =0.718), and CoMSIA model (steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, H-bond donor and acceptor) (q
                     2
                     =0.525, r
                     2
                     =0.680) and CoMFA model (q
                     2
                     =0.471, r
                     2
                     =0.768), and CoMSIA model (steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic) (q
                     2
                     =0.534, r
                     2
                     =0.947), using systematic search conformation and simulated annealing based alignment, respectively. The alignment using systematic search conformation gives better statistical results in terms of r
                     2
                     pred than simulated annealing and therefore it was used for further analysis. Finally, the CoMFA and CoMISA results were then graphically interpreted by field contribution maps.

The optimum CoMFA model was derived with the combination of steric and electrostatic field contribution and Gasteiger–Hückel charge method with 2.0Å grid space. Twenty different CoMFA models were generated with different alignments and different combinations of test and training set molecules. The statistical results of the CoMFA model using systematic search was shown in Table 2
                         and simulated annealing is shown in Supplementary Table 1. The CoMFA model developed using the alignment performed from systematic search was better in terms of statistical values and it was used for contour map analysis. The q
                        2 values was found to be above 0.45 and r
                        2 was above 0.5. The predictive ability of the developed CoMFA model was assessed by the test set (15 molecules) predictions, which were excluded during CoMFA model generation. The r
                        2
                        pred value of the generated models ranges from 0.466 to 0.732. Based on higher r
                        2
                        pred value model 5 was selected as best CoMFA model whose predictive ability of the test set was found to be 0.732. For the selected model leave one out analysis gave the cross-validated q
                        2 of 0.488 with three components and noncross-validated PLS analysis resulted in a correlation coefficient r
                        2 of 0.718, F
                        =39.062, and an estimated standard error of 0.586. The steric contribution (0.798) of the model was higher than electrostatic field contribution (0.202). Predicted and experimental activities and their residual values of all inhibitors are shown in Table 8
                         
                        
                         
                        
                        , and the corresponding scatter plot is depicted in Fig. 2
                        (a). The residual value of all compounds is less than 1 with indicates the goodness of the model.

Different field combinations of CoMSIA models were generated using Gasteiger–Hückel charge method with 2.0Å grid space. The statistical results obtained by combinations of steric (S) and electrostatic (E) were listed in Table 3
                        . With the steric and electrostatic combination the higher r
                        2
                        pred (0.671) was observed in model 4. The results of steric (S), electrostatic (E) and hydrophobic (H) were listed in Table 4 among the models generated with these combinations, model 15 shows higher r
                        2
                        pred (0.751). The third combination which includes steric (S), electrostatic (E) and hydrogen bond donor (D) gave higher r
                        2
                        pred (0.762) in model 22 and is listed in Table 5. The steric (S), electrostatic (E) and hydrogen bond acceptor (D) results were listed in Table 6 and model 35 has higher r
                        2
                        pred (0.798). The final combination which includes all descriptors such as steric (S), electrostatic (E), hydrophobic (H), hydrogen bond donor (D), and hydrogen bond acceptor (A) shows highest r
                        2
                        pred value as 0.883 in model 45 and listed in Table 7. The statistical results of CoMSIA model developed using alignment performed using bioactive conformation obtained from simulated annealing were tabulated in Supplementary Tables 2–6 for S+E, S+E+H, S+E+D, S+E+A, S+E+H, D+A, respectively. When comparing all the models generated by CoMSIA the model 45 which uses steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, donor and acceptor parameters shows highest r
                        2
                        pred values than others. Hence the steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, H-bond donor and acceptor field are important in determining the inhibitor activity of CRTh2 antagonists.

The optimum model for CoMSIA analysis was selected based on higher r
                        2
                        pred which was obtained with the combination of S, E, H, D and A parameters. The final model for CoMSIA yielded q
                        2
                        =0.525 and r
                        2
                        =0.719 with N=2. The field contributions value showed the percentage of S (15.2%), E (13.8%), H (23.9%), D (12.1%) and A (35.0%) fields contribution for the model development. The F value and SEE for CoMSIA model was found to be 49.830 and 0.618, respectively. The predictive ability of the developed CoMSIA model was assessed by the test set (15 compounds) predictions, which were excluded during CoMSIA model generation. The predictive ability of the test set was 0.883. Predicted and experimental activities and their residual values of inhibitors are shown in Table 8, and the corresponding scatter plot is depicted in Fig. 2(b). The residual value of the compounds is not more than 1.5 which confirms the better predictive ability of the model.

In precise, the CoMFA and CoMSIA models were developed using two different alignments. The systematic search and simulated annealing conformation of highly active molecule was used for alignment. The best predictions obtained for CoMFA and CoMSIA models using two different alignments were compared and tabulated in Table 9
                        . The alignment using systematic search conformation of highly active molecule provides better predictive ability of the model (CoMFA r
                        2
                        pred
                        =0.732; CoMSIA r
                        2
                        pred
                        =0.883) for the same set of training set and test set.

The CoMFA contour map was generated based on the ligand-based (atom-by atom matching) alignment which uses the bioactive conformation obtained from systematic search method. The CoMFA result is usually represented as 3D contour map. It shows regions where variations of steric and electrostatic nature in the structural features of the different molecules contained in the training set leads to increase or decrease in the activity. In case of CoMFA the green contours denote favorable steric interactions and the yellow contours show the region where the steric group was not favored. The most active compound 58 was superimposed with steric contour plots and shown in Fig. 3
                        (a). The green steric contour near the R
                        2 position of the C-ring indicates that bulkier substituents are preferred at this position. Thus, compounds 58 with bulkier substituents such as Ph at this position are more active than other compounds. Compound 14, 15 and 16 which have CH2 and COOEt instead of C ring lies towards the unfavorable (yellow) region and their activity was found to be lesser than highly active compound. This indicates that bulky substitution around the steric green region is highly desirable for improved inhibitory potency. The electrostatic interactions is represented by red and blue contours, among which blue colored regions show areas where more positively charged groups are favored, and red region highlight areas where groups with more negative charges are favored. These contour maps give us some general insight into the nature of the receptor-ligand binding region. The electrostatic contour plot of highly active compound is depicted in Fig. 3(b). The electrostatic contour plot on the set of 48 compounds shows that there is a big blue colored region situated close to the R
                        2 positions of the C-ring. The R
                        2 position of C-ring is seen in blue contour of compound 58 which is highly active compound in this dataset. The positive charges in these regions are very important for ligand binding, and electro positive group linked to this position will enhance the biological activity. The red electrostatic contour plot at R group present at the A ring of compounds 47–54 also showed good activity. Hence the electronegative group present at this position is responsible for inhibitory activity. Compounds 1–17 does not have C ring in their structure and those compounds are seen towards the yellow steric contour plot and in red electrostatic contour plot. Hence the activities of those compounds were found to lesser than highly active compounds.

The steric contour map of CoMSIA is displayed in Fig. 4
                        (a). The bulkier substituents like Me and Ph present in the R
                        2 position of the C-ring is found in the green contour map (compound 55, 56, 57 and 58) which is said to be favorable region in steric interaction. The groups like Cl and OMe present in the C ring of compounds 34–38 is also projected toward the green contour map. Hence, the bulkier substituents present in steric green contour are responsible for increasing the activity. The R1 position of C ring having Et, Bu and Me group are found in yellow contour map which is unfavoured region in steric interaction.

The electrostatic interactions of highly active compound is represented by red and blue contours in Fig. 4(b), among which blue colored regions show areas where more positively charged groups are favored, and red region highlight areas where groups with more negative charges are favored. The atoms connecting the sulphur atom with the C ring in all compounds are positively charged groups and they are found in blue contour map which will increase the activity. The substituent present at the R
                        1 and R
                        2 position of C-ring are present in red region which indicates more negatively charged groups are present at this position.

In the hydrophobic contour maps, yellow contour map indicates the region where the hydrophobic substitutions are favorable for activity and white contour indicates the disfavoured region for inhibitory activity. Hydrophobic contour map of highly active compound with substituents like Ph present in R
                        2 position of the C- ring lies in yellow contour and is displayed in Fig. 4(c). The substituents like Cl, Br, CO2Me and OMe present at the C4 position of the C-ring also found close to yellow contour plot and their activity values are in the range 6.2–6.4. The O atom present at the C-ring in the compounds 47–65 projected towards the white contour region which indicates the presence of O atom at this position is hydrophobically unfavorable.

The cyan contour region indicates the hydrogen bond donor group increases the activity and purple contour map indicates the hydrogen bond donor group decreases the activity in H-bond donor interactions. CoMSIA H-bond donor contour map for the most active compound is shown in Fig. 4(d). The cyan color contour is present at the R
                        2 present in C-ring of the compounds 60–65. The atoms near this position may act as hydrogen bonding donor and may produce hydrogen bonding interactions with the receptor site. The cyan contour map explain the importance of hydrogen bond donor group which is necessary to enhance the biological activity. The substituents like Cl, Me, OMe, CO2Me at C5 position in the C-ring of the compound 34–38 is present in the purple contour map. Hence these groups leads to lower biological activity.

In H-bond acceptor interactions, magenta contour map indicates where hydrogen bond acceptor group increases the activity and red contour indicates the hydrogen bond acceptor group decreases the activity. The superimposition of magenta and red contour map with the highly active compounds is shown in Fig. 4(e). The A ring and the substituents at the B ring in the compounds 1–18 is found near the red contour map which may the reason for their lower activity.

In summary, it is very informative to see a 3D picture of how structural changes influence biological activities. The CoMFA and CoMSIA contour map gives valuable information to understand 3D-QSAR relationships between structures and their biological activity. According to the contour maps, the substitutions at the R
                        2 position of the C-ring are highly responsible for the activity. The C ring is not found in compounds 1–17 and most of their region lies towards the unfavorable region in both CoMFA and CoMSIA contour map which leads to the conclusion that this may be the reason that the activities of these compounds were found to lesser than highly active compounds.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In the present study, we developed 3D-QSAR models of CRTh2 antagonist 2-(2-(benzylthio)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl) acetic acids using CoMFA and CoMSIA methods based on the atom-by-atom matching alignment using two different bioactive conformations. Models with reasonable statistics were obtained with different combinations. Alignment performed using the bioactive conformation resulted from systematic search gave better statistical results. The results showed that CoMSIA model gives a better prediction than CoMFA model and the steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor parameters are highly desirable for potent inhibitory activity. We also found that C ring plays a major role in the activity of these compounds. The information obtained from the contour map could be useful for designing more potent CRTh2 inhibitors.
