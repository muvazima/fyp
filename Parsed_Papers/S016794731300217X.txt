                  The statistical analysis of the method of construction of the market graph when considered as a multiple decision statistical procedure is investigated. It is shown that under the condition of additivity of the loss function the method can be optimal in different classes of unbiased multiple statistical procedures. The results are obtained by application of the Lehmann theory of multiple decision procedures to the method of construction of the market graph. The main findings are illustrated by numerical studies of the conditional risk of multiple decision statistical procedures for different loss functions and different return distributions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Stock market models have attracted great attention in mathematical modeling since the seminal work by Markowitz (1952). An important characteristic of these models is the analysis of simultaneous behavior of the stocks based on their correlations. At the same time, the stock market can be considered as a complex network where the stocks are the nodes of the network and the correlation is a measure of similarity between them (Mantegna, 1999; Mantegna and Stanley, 2000; Tumminello et al., 2010). In the paper Boginsky et al. (2003) a new model for the analysis of the stock market was introduced. The method involves the construction of the market graph associated with the stock market and the investigation of the structural characteristics (cliques, independent sets and others) of this graph. This method was recently developed by Boginsky et al. (2005), Boginsky et al. (2006), and Huang et al. (2009); see also Bautin et al. (2013) and Vinciotti and Hashem (2013).

The main goal of the present paper is the investigation of the market graph construction from a statistical point of view. We consider a market graph construction as a multiple decision procedure. In our investigation we consider the class of unbiased statistical procedures in the sense of Lehmann (1951) and Lehmann and Romano (2005a). As a model of the financial market we use the Markowitz type model (Markowitz, 1952, 2010). We call a true market graph the graph with the incidence matrix with entries 0 and 1, where we have 0 if the associated correlation is less than a given threshold and 1 otherwise. In Boginsky et al. (2003) the authors use a sample market graph constructed in the same way from the sample correlations. We show that the procedure of this type can be made optimal in the class of unbiased multiple decision statistical procedures. This result is obtained by application of the Lehmann theory of multiple decision problems to the method of construction of the market graph. In the framework of the Lehmann theory (Lehmann, 1957) we discuss the following conditions of optimality for the multiple decision statistical procedures: choice of the generating hypotheses, compatibility of the family of tests for the generating hypotheses with decision space for the original hypotheses, and additivity of the loss function. We prove that the multiple decision statistical procedure for the construction of the market graph is optimal if one uses the tests of the Neyman structures. From the other hand, in practice it is more convenient to use classical unbiased correlation tests. We prove that the associated multiple decision statistical procedure is also optimal, but in a restricted class of unbiased multiple decision statistical procedures.

The paper is organized as follow. In Section  2 we introduce the market graph and give a formal statement of the problem. In Section  3, we recall some basic concepts from the Lehmann theory (Lehmann, 1957). In Section  4, we study (from a statistical point of view) the method of construction of the market graph. In Section  5, we present results of numerical simulation and discuss the conditional risk of described statistical procedures. In the last Section  6, we summarize the main results of the paper.

In the present paper we study, from the statistical point of view, the procedure of construction of the sample market graph as a procedure of identification of the true market graph.

The problem of identification of the true market graph can be formulated as a multiple decision problem (in the sense of  Lehmann, 1957) of the selection of one from the set of hypotheses:

These results allow us to construct the optimal multiple decision statistical procedures from the optimal statistical procedures for generating hypotheses testing. We use this in the next section. The Lehmann theory is further developed in Rao and Swarupchand (2009), Lehmann and Romano (2005b), Shaffer (2006) and Romano and Wolf (2007).

There are known tests (Lehmann and Romano, 2005a) for the hypotheses testing of (15). Therefore, one can construct the associated multiple decision statistical procedure. We illustrate it by the following example 
                           Example 2
                           Let

                                 =

                               and the hypotheses testing of (15) is made by the classical Pearson correlation tests. Then the multiple decision statistical procedure (7) takes the form:

The tests of the Neyman structures for the generating hypotheses (15) are optimal in the class of unbiased tests. Therefore, if the condition of the additivity of the loss function is satisfied, then the associated multiple decision statistical procedure is optimal. The main conclusion therefore is: the multiple decision statistical procedure for the construction of the market graph is optimal if for the construction one uses the tests of the Neyman structures.

In practice however for hypotheses testing of the problem (15) one usually uses a simplified class of tests where the statistic of test depends only on

We illustrate our findings by numerical simulations for two types of multivariate distributions: multivariate normal distribution and multivariate 
                        t
                     -distribution (multivariate Student distribution). The use of multivariate 
                        t
                     -distribution is motivated by the known property of heavy tails of its marginal distributions, which fits better the empirical market data. We present the numerical experiments under the following assumptions:

Our main goal is to study the conditional risk of multiple decision statistical procedures. In the case of multiple decision procedures the conditional risk can be calculated by (13)–(14). This is a linear combination of probabilities of all possible errors weighted by the associated losses. We note that the condition of unbiasedness implies a non linear dependence of conditional risk on the choice of the loss function. We restrict ourself to the case where the sample graph construction is based on the Pearson correlation tests for generating hypotheses testing. We use the following characteristics of the associated multiple decision statistical procedures as a functions of the threshold

In our setting, the method of construction of the market graph from Boginsky et al. (2003) is a particular case of described statistical procedures with 
                        a
                        =
                        b
                      i.e.  
                        α
                        =
                        0.5
                     . The results of numerical simulations show how the conditional risk depends on the choice of the loss function. We illustrate it by the Figures below.

The Figs. 1–6
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                         correspond to the numerical experiments for the case of multivariate normal distributions of 
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        .

Analysis of the Figs. 1–4 shows that if the significance level 
                           α
                         is decreasing then the number of the singular losses of the type “a” is decreasing and the number of the singular losses of the type “b” is increasing. This is expected. Figs. 1–2 show the rate of change of the number of the singular losses of the type “a” and Figs. 3–4 show the rate of change of the number of the singular losses of the type “b”. One can see that the rates of changes have a non linear connection. This non linearity leads to the essential decreasing of conditional risk as it is shown on the Figs. 5–6. This phenomena is numerically well studied for the classical hypotheses testing but it is not well investigated for the multiple decision statistical procedures. For the sparse graph (Figs. 2, 4, 6) the main contribution in conditional risk is given by the number of the singular losses of the type “a”, the contribution of the number of the singular losses of the type “b” being neglected (for any significance level). The situation is different for the real data graph (Figs. 1, 3, 5). For

                         the conditional risk is dominated by the number of the singular losses of the type “b”. Therefore, one can control the conditional risk of multiple decision statistical procedures for the market graph construction by the choice of the loss function.

                        . The correlation matrices (real data matrix and sparse matrix) for this case are the same as for the multivariate normal distribution case. We use the same values of

                         for the generating hypotheses testing as for the normal case. Analysis of the Figs. 7–10 shows that if the significance level 
                           α
                         is decreasing then the number of the singular losses of the type “a” is decreasing and the number of the singular losses of the type “b” is increasing. This is the same as for the normal case. Figs. 7–8 show the rate of change of the number of the singular losses of the type “a” and Figs. 9–10 show the rate of change of the number of the singular losses of the type “b”. However, the rate of changes is essentially different from the rate of changes for the normal case. This leads to the serious difference in the behavior of the conditional risks for different distributions. As it was noted above, the decreasing of the significance level 
                           α
                         implies an essential decreasing of conditional risk for the normal distribution case (Figs. 5–6) which is not true for the 
                           t
                        -distribution case (Figs. 11–12). Therefore, a deviation from normality can restrict the control of conditional risk.

In the present paper different statistical procedures for the market graph construction are investigated. All procedures differ on the choice of statistical tests for generating hypotheses testing. Our main findings are:

The multiple decision statistical procedure for the construction of the market graph is optimal in a restricted class of unbiased statistical procedures if for generating hypotheses testing one uses the classical Pearson correlation tests. According to this procedure, the sample market graph is constructed in the following way. Two vertices 
                                 i
                               and 
                                 j
                               are connected by an edge if the corresponding sample correlation 
                                 
                                    
                                       s
                                    
                                    
                                       i
                                       ,
                                       j
                                    
                                 
                               is larger than a given threshold 
                                 c
                              . The threshold 
                                 c
                               depends on the threshold for the true market graph, significance level of the test, and the number of observations. The calculation of 
                                 c
                               is easy and involves the known distribution of 
                                 
                                    
                                       s

                                       j
                                    
                                 
                               (Anderson, 2003). The procedure is optimal in the restricted class of unbiased statistical procedures where the statistics of generating hypotheses tests depends only on observations for the stocks 
                                 i
                               and 
                                 j
                              . In particular, the method of the market graph construction from Boginsky et al. (2003) is optimal in this class for a special choice of significance level 
                                 α
                                 =
                                 0.5
                              .

The optimality of the described statistical procedures is essentially based in the additional assumption of normality on the additivity condition for the loss function. The last condition can be considered as natural for the investigated problems.

Numerical experiments show a possibility to control the conditional risk by the choice of the loss function in the case of multivariate normal distribution. The deviation from normality can restrict the control of conditional risk as it is shown for the multivariate Student 
                                 t
                              -distribution. The detailed analysis of this will be given in a future publication.
