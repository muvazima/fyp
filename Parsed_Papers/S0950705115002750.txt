                  This article introduces proximal three-way decision-making. This form of 3-way decision-making stems from the proximity structures that result from endowing each nonempty set of social network triangulation nodes with several proximity relations. A triangulation is obtained by connecting every pair of nearest neighbour nodes with a straight edge. The proposed approach to 3-way decision-making results from the analysis of Delaunay graphs (spatial) as well as friendship network (social) of location-based social network nodes. The knowledge gained from proximal three-way decision-making is in the form of information granules that are near sets of nodes representing interaction between either casual users or friends in a social network. A practical illustration of proximal three-way decision-making is given in terms of a public domain large-scale social network dataset.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This article introduces proximal three-way decision-making based on the spatial and friendship relationships between nodes in social networks. The proposed approach to three-way decision-making results from recent work on Voronoï tessellation [29], Delaunay triangulation [27] of subsets in the Euclidean plane and visibility in Delaunay meshes [30]. This work also carries forward recent work on proximity (expressions of nearness between sets), starting with F. Riesz (1908 [33]) and E. Čech (Brno seminar, May 1936 to November 1939 [38]) leading to advanced work on proximity by S.A. Naimpally (from 1969 to 2014, e.g., [23,21]) and others [18,19] as well as recent work on new forms of proximity [32,28,14]. Delaunay triangulations, introduced by B.N. Delone (Delaunay) [6], represent discrete triangular-shaped approximation of continuous space. This representation partitions the space into regions. The combination of Delaunay triangulation and proximity theory leads rather naturally to a formal foundation for proximal three-way decision-making introduced in this article. In this work, spatial properties are analysed based on the proximity or remoteness of triangle vertices and line segments (sides of triangles) in a Delaunay triangulation of network nodes. The analysis of these properties leads to three types of decisions (acceptance, deferment, rejection) based on proximal relations: strongly near, near and far respectively in analysing subgroups in a network.

Recently, location-based online social networking applications have emerged, where users share their current location by checking-in on websites such as Foursquare, Facebook, Gowalla [35]. The access to geographic locations of users as well as friendship links amongst them makes it possible to gain insight into socio-spatial properties of such networks. In the sequel, it is noted that proximal three-way decision-making complements recent work on rough set-based three-way decision-making.

Three-way decision-making based on rough sets is a natural outcome of considering the quality of the positive, negative and boundary regions in the approximation of a set [47, Section 5.2.1, p. 86]. These three regions induce rules for three-way decisions: acceptance, rejection, deferment. The framework for a Delaunay triangulation-based proximal three-way decision-making (PTWD) and rough set based three-way decision making (RTWD) models are rooted in granular computing. The notion of nearness not only differs from indiscernibility but is a more general concept and in consequence, all basic notions of rough sets can be obtained within the near set framework [43]. The relationship between RTWD and PTWD can be best described as follows: (i) both of these approaches are set-theoretic based models, (ii) RTWD partitions the universe of objects or observations into three disjoint regions and PTWD involves discrete approximation of continuous space which partitions the space into regions, (iii) RTWD consists of a set of objects endowed with an equivalence relation whereas PTWD consists of a set nodes endowed with a proximity (nearness) relation, (iv) the set of nodes X in PTWD is in the Euclidean space 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           2
                        
                      whereas the universe U in RTWD is typically in non-Euclidean space, and lastly, (v) depending on a specific application, in PTWD one can envision proximity relation strongly near leading to an accept decision, near leading to a deferment decision and far leading to a reject decision. Some applications of PTWD can be in the following areas: (i) improving content-delivery using socio-spatial ties. These include on-line multimedia streaming where users’ social links are used by providers who rely on content delivery networks, (ii) local activism and advocacy that rely on socio-spatial ties, (iii) advertising, and (iv) potential sites for speciality retailing with highly customised offerings. For example, strongly near proximal decision-making could play an important role in local activism and speciality retailing whereas both strongly near and near can be influential in advertising.

The contribution of the article is a first attempt at creating a framework for proximal three-way decisions based on Delaunay triangulations in the study of socio-spatial properties of location-based social networks. This form of three-way decision-making is a quintessential application of proximity (near) set theory. It derives its strength from topological spaces endowed with several proximity relations, namely, δ
                     (near), 
                        
                           δ
                           
                              ∧
                              
                              
                              
                              ∧
                           
                        
                      (strongly near) and 
                        δ
                      (far). This is a metric-free form of three-way decision-making, since proximal three-way decision-making does not depend on a metric to derive graph properties.

The Delaunay Proximity Graph (spatial) and Friendship Network (social) were both derived from the Gowalla data set from Stanford University.

We now present works related to this research in three parts. We start with a discussion of three-way decision-making in the context of rough sets, followed by works on Delaunay triangulation and concluding with location-based social networks.

Historically, three-way decision-making with classical rough sets has been explored in the context of classification of concepts based on decision rules [45,46]. The model for three-way decisions is to segment a finite non-empty universe of objects or observations U into three-pairwise disjoint regions (positive, negative and boundary) based on a set of criteria or conditions C. One important observation from these studies has been the need for interpretation of decisions based on semantics rather than syntax, leading to a more realistic set of decisions as to whether to accept, reject or defer a concept. In other words, the positive, negative and boundary regions induced by approximations leads to ternary classifications rather than strict binary classifications based on classical rough sets [25]. In a probabilistic form of rough sets, the interpretation of these rules changes subtly and provides a probabilistic form of positive, negative and boundary regions allowing for gradations in the definitions of these regions thereby sharpening decision-making capabilities. In other words, the derivation of these gradations (typically two thresholds) has been a subject of intense study leading to decision-theoretic models and game-theoretic models [45–47,44,1,15]. An in-depth discussion of these two forms of probabilistic models of the three-way decisions as well as applications of game-theoretic model can be found in [1,15]. Since decision rules form the basis for evaluation, it is also interesting to observe that decision rules derived from the classical rough set model are qualitative compared to the rules derived from the probabilistic model which are quantitative. Significantly, the idea of having two threshold parameters α and β provides a more richer and flexible interpretation of outcomes that are particularly relevant to real-world applications. Application of the decision-theoretic model in a web-based medical support system can be found in [44]. A more recent application in three-way decision making clustering algorithm has been applied to a dolphin social network [48]. Review of other models of set-theoretic based approaches such as shadowed or interval sets are beyond the scope of this paper.

Delaunay triangulations, introduced by B.N. Delone (Delaunay) [6], represent discrete triangular-shaped approximation of continuous space. This representation partitions the space into regions. This partitioning (or decomposition) is made possible by a popular method called the Voronoï diagram [40,41]. The Voronoï diagram method has particular importance in science and engineering. A Voronoï diagram is a partition of a nonempty set into what are known as regions. Let S be a set sites (mesh generating points). A Voronoï region of a site p ∈ S contains every point in the plane that is closer to p than to any other site in S. Such diagrams have practical applications especially in visualisation of neighbourly regions of social networks. Visualisation of social networks is commonly done using Delaunay triangulation to generate meshes over fixed position network nodes (see, e.g., [13, Section 3.3, p. 431, 24,4]). In [13], the focus is on algorithms for drawing clustered graphs such as topographic maps which is a type of map easily understandable by users not familiar with information visualisation. The goal is to be able to visualise communities, where nested communities can be expressed using clusters. In [24], concepts and definitions from graph theory as well as a variety of graph structural measures, useful for investigation of local and global network structure is discussed. Delaunay triangulation and Voronoï tessellation methods are widely used in behavioural ecology since these methods relate to functional properties such as regions of influence or zones of danger of the group [16]. The end result of visualising the structure of social network is a better understanding of local group behaviour, which is directly related to the study of the collective behaviour of organisms(see, e.g., [16, Section 14.4.4, p. 284]). Tracking the evolution of interacting populations in a system of cities with a spider network of water and railways produced by Delaunay triangulation is discussed in [42]. A popular swarm dynamics model where the communication topology is described by Delaunay triangulation, which is defined by each individual’s Voronoï neighbours is described in [17]. It has been shown that the spatial position of individuals socially interacting with other members of a group affects their influence on the group.
                     

Social networks have been modelled as a graph of relationships amongst individuals (nodes) and social relationships have been studied as a basis for friendship and mobility [11]. Location-based social networks maintain explicit friendship networks, while in mobile phones, the network can be inferred from the communication network [8,35]. Spatial networks organise and structure human social, economic, and cultural systems [24]. Spatial networks have largely been studied in the context of transportation, power grids, telecommunication and internet connectivity where nodes are embedded in a metric space [2]. On-line location-based social networks have attracted a number of studies especially with regards to socio-spatial properties of social triangles [36] or analysis of friendship and mobility [11]. In [36], the network is represented as an undirected graph and the spatial properties are investigated with online users located over the 2-dimensional surface of the Earth and the great-circle distance is used as a metric. The social links are explored with the probability of friendship P(d) calculated as a function of distance d by counting Ld
                        , the number of social links with length d, and by estimating Nd
                        , the number of pairs of users at distance d. In [11], the focus is on developing a periodic and social mobility model that can accurately predict future movements of an individual using on-line location-based social network data. It is an expectation–maximisation based parameter estimation method. The findings are that humans experience a combination of strong short range spatially and temporally periodic movement that is not impacted by the social network structure, while long-distance travel is more influenced by the social network ties. In [3], identification of place-focused communities useful in user-centric applications has been studied.

This section briefly introduces the computational geometry and topology underlying the visualisation of social networks using Delaunay triangulation [10,34]. Delaunay triangulation is the most popular form amongst different types of triangulation [5]. A Voronoï diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on ’closeness’ to points in a specific set of sites in the plane (ex: Vp, Vq
                      in Fig. 1). That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. A Voronoï region of a site is analogous to the neighbourhood of a point. In a Delaunay triangulation, the sites are connected by straight edges.

Let S be a nonempty set of sites (locations in a network where messages originate in a location-based social network such as Gowalla [11]). A Voronoï region of a site p ∈ S contains every point in the plane that is closer to p than to any other site in S 
                     [12, Section 1.1, p. 99]. Voronoï regions are proximal (near), provided the regions have at least one point in common [29, Section 2, p. 2]. Voronoï regions are strongly near, provided the regions have a common edge [27, Section 3, p. 2]. For example, edge 
                        
                           xy
                           ¯
                        
                      in Fig. 1 is common to two Voronoï regions, namely, Vp, Vq
                     .

The dual of a Voronoï diagram is a Delaunay triangulation. In the plane, a Delaunay triangulation defines triangular regions formed by connecting nearest Voronoï neighbour nodes with straight edges. That is, each connection between two nearest neighbour nodes (sites) is represented by a straight edge, provided the corresponding Voronoï regions share an edge [10, Section 2.3, p 11,27]. A Delaunay edge (Delaunay line segment) is a straight edge between a pair of nearest neighbour Voronoï region nodes (sites). See edges 
                        
                           
                              pq
                              ¯
                           
                           ,
                           
                              pr
                              ¯
                           
                           ,
                           
                              rq
                              ¯
                           
                        
                      in Fig. 1 for examples of Delaunay triangle edges. Carrying this a step further, node r in Fig. 1 is strongly near nodes p, q, since interaction is possible between the nodes in the Delaunay triangle ▵(
                        pqr
                     ). A pair of Delaunay triangles are connected, provided the triangles have at least one vertex in common. A Delaunay mesh is a collection of Delaunay triangles such that each pair of triangles is connected.


                     Delaunay triangulation of social network nodes is carried out by connecting each node p to those nodes q that are nearest to p. These nodes represent persons who send messages to and receive messages from other persons via a telecommunication network or checkin in a web-based social network. Connections are represented by Delaunay line segments 
                        
                           pq
                           ¯
                        
                      in a proximity graph. A proximity graph is a geometric representation of a social network. A Delaunay proximity graph is an instantiation of a Delaunay mesh, which is a collection of connected nearest neighbour triangles that cover a linear space such as the Euclidean space 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           2
                        
                     . From decisions about the proximity of nodes in a Delaunay triangulation, one can then begin to extract useful information such as social, economic or cultural that characterises a social network [24].
                        Example 3.1
                        Delaunay triangulation of social network nodes


                        A sample Delaunay triangulation of a local social network with 11 nodes is shown in Fig. 2
                           . Node 2 in this network is strongly near nodes 1, 11, 8, 5, 4, forming a social network cluster represented by the mesh of triangles that have 2 as a common vertex, namely, ▵(2, 1, 11), ▵(2, 11, 8), ▵(2, 8, 5), ▵(2, 5, 4).

One node p is visible to another node q, provided there is no other node between p and q 
                     [9, Section II, p. 34]. Otherwise, one node is not visible (invisible) to another node in the case there is a node between the two nodes.
                        Example 3.2
                        Visibility in a Delaunay triangulation of social network nodes


                        In Fig. 2, nodes 2 and 3 are visible to each other. By contrast, node 3 is not visible to node 2, since nodes 1 and 11 are blocking nodes that are in between nodes 2 and 3. Node 2 has visibility with magnitude 5, since nodes 1, 11, 4, 5, and 8 are visible from node 2. Node 10 has less visibility than node 2, since only nodes 4, 7, 6, 9 and 3 are visible from node 10.

The set of nodes in a social network endowed with a proximity relation has a naturally defined topology. Each node in this set has properties that lead to proximal three-way decisions. Each set of nodes in a planar triangulation of a social network X in 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           2
                        
                      (Euclidean plane) maps to an indexed proximal three-way decision.

In this work, Delaunay proximity graphs are drawn on a finite-dimensional normed linear space E that is topological. The closure of A⊂E (denoted clA) is defined by

Properties of three-way decisions arise naturally from the structure of social network triangulations (see, e.g., [24, Section 64.2.2, p. 1257]). Proximal decision-making derived from social network connections, paves the way from a knowledge of simple nodes (low triangular connectivity) to supernodes (sets of many triangles originating from a single network client) [39, Section 4, p. 683]. From such proximal three-way decision-making, a number of quantitative properties of local social networks can be derived. In the context of proximity graphs representing social networks, a graph vertex is called a node. Note that properties one through four are local to a node whereas density property applies to the entire proximity graph.

In general, social interaction can be viewed in terms of three forms of communication: bi-nodal, multi-nodal, uni-nodal. Bi-nodal communication is between a pair of individuals, multi-nodal communication between three or more members of a group, and uni-nodal communication is self-referential (isolated individual).


                     Table 1 shows the relationship between proximity relations: near, strongly near and far formed by social interactions (bi-nodal, multi-nodal and uni-nodal communications), geometry and suggested decisions. The proximity relations lead to 3-way PTWD where the notion of accept, reject or defer actions are application dependent.

We now give some examples derived from Gowalla which is online location based social network.

                      Location-based social networks maintain explicit friendship networks which are useful in these studies. These online social networking applications provide location specific data since users share their current location by checking-in on these websites. Since this site does not maintain a specific home location, for the purpose of this study, we have used the most frequently checked-in location. In the discussion that follows, we will refer to Delaunay proximity graphs as Delaunay graphs which were created using the method outlined in [31].
                  

The social network in Fig. 3
                         is represented graphically in Fig. 4.3
                        , derived using the edge information in this dataset. The spatial network using Delaunay triangulation and Voronoï diagram shown in Figs. 4.1 and 4.2 were derived from the latitude and longitude data of the check-in information from the dataset. A snapshot of five users is given in Table 2. The userid refers to the unique id of the user from dataset.


                        Table 3 shows local properties for the Delaunay graph and the friendship network. To facilitate comparison, we have renamed the nodes of the friendship network to match that of the Delaunay graph in all the examples. Also,

                         in Fig. 4.3. One can observe from the two structures that the differences arise mainly due to the fact that there are more triangles in the friendship network.

The social network in Fig. 5 spans the Atlantic and is represented graphically in Fig. 6.3, derived from the edge information from the dataset. This social network has a distinguishing feature, i.e.. three triangles share a common edge. The Delaunay triangulation and Voronoï diagram shown in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2 were derived from the latitude and longitude data of the check-in information from the dataset. A snapshot of this information used in these figures given in Table 4.

It is interesting to observe that both of these two structures share the same set of triangles. However, the actual nodes (userid) that form the vertices are different. In Table 5, the first five rows are properties of the Delaunay graph and the last five rows are properties of the friendship network. In contrast to Example 1,

The social network in Fig. 7 is represented graphically in Fig. 8.3, derived using the edge information from the dataset. The mesh for this social network is more complex than the meshes given in the previous examples. The Delaunay triangulation and Voronoï diagram shown in Figs. 8.1 and 8.2 were derived from the latitude and longitude data of the check-in information from the dataset. A snapshot of this information used in these figures given in Table 6. For the Delaunay graph and Friendship network in Fig. 8,

It is interesting to observe that both the spatial and social graphs share the same set of triangles but the actual nodes (userid) that form the vertices are different. However, due to the nature of the embedded meshes densities for Delaunay graph Densityd

The other interesting observation is that in this example one can see some similarity emerging with far relationship between the two structures. For example, user 1 is far from users 3 and 5 in both structures, user 2 is far from users 5 and 7, user 3 is far from user 1, user 4 is far from user 7, user 5 is far from users 1 and 2, user 7 is far from user 8 and user 8 is far from user 3.

Each of the three-way decisions for node 1f in Fig. 11 are derived come from row 1 in the Friendship part of Table 7. We know from the neighbourhood property, that node 1f is near two other nodes in the friendship triangulation, namely, nodes 2f,8f. Combining that knowledge with the results from the friendship triangulation graph, we derive the following decision about the neighbours of node 1f, namely,

                     Table 9 shows the experimental results from the full Gowalla data. There are 196,585 nodes and 1,900,655 edges in this dataset. The Friendship network and Delaunay graphs were implemented in MATLAB®. The unfiltered friendship network resulted in 2,273,138 triangles. However, almost 50% of the triangles were eliminated due to the presence of entries with missing locations. As a result, 1,056,922 triangles were retained. Also, a vast majority of the triangles were detected in the first 10% of the data. With the Delaunay graph, they were overlapping points i.e. users checked-in from the same location. Also, erroneous check-ins (incorrected latitude or longitude values) were eliminated. One can also observe that the number of common edges outnumber the number of triangles between the two graphs. This indicates that there are fewer triads or strongly near relations.
                     
                        Remark 7.1
                        From the experiments, one can observe the following socio-spatial properties, (i) 3336 bi-nodal communications are similar in both graphs. This means that the pairs of individuals are also spatially close (neighbourhood). (ii) 268 tri-nodal communications are similar in both graphs. In other words, these user traids also live in close proximity to each other based on their check-in information.

Sociologists have studied the role of distance and technology for interpersonal contact [20]. One important assumption is that individuals interact more with their spatial neighbours thereby maintaining their friendship[37]. In other words, an interesting property that is explored is whether spatial proximity has a bearing on individual interactions or if some individuals prefer to connect with others further away. The strongest form of nearness is strongly near which in its simplest form is a triad with mutually connected individuals whereas near exhibits a relationship between neighbours.

The derivation for local properties (for individual users) for each of graphs is straightforward and is treated as out of the scope for this paper. A visual representation of the Delaunay triangulation for the entire dataset is shown in Fig. 12 and for friendship network is shown in Fig. 13
                     . We have chosen to display only a 100K triangles for the friendship network since the entire graph becomes cluttered when all the triangles are displayed.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Proximal three-way decision-making is carried out in the context of various triangulation graphs. Two such graphs (Delaunay and friendship graphs) provide a basis for the approach to three-way decision-making presented in this article. This form of three-way decision-making is a quintessential application of recent results in proximity (near) set theory. It derives its strength from topological spaces endowed with several proximity relations, namely, δ
                     (near), 
                        
                           δ
                           
                              ∧
                              
                              
                              
                              ∧
                           
                        
                     
                     (strongly near) and 
                        δ
                      
                     (far). This is a metric-free form of three-way decision-making, since proximal three-way decision-making does not depend on a metric to derive graph properties. Instead, three-way decision-making depends entirely on set theory and computational geometry. The following observations can be made in the context of location-based social networks: i) in social interactions, distance is still important and social interaction is reflected in the proximity of network triangulations, ii) strongly near implies near but not vice versa, and iii) as the number of nodes (individuals) increase, the number of similar triads increase in spatial and social graphs resulting in more spatial homogeneity.
