                  An integrated microbiological–economic framework for policy support is developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of alternative intervention methods and strategies to reduce the risk of Campylobacter in broilers. Four interventions at the farm level and four interventions at the processing stage are considered. Cost analyses are conducted for different risk reduction targets and for three alternative scenarios concerning the acceptable range of interventions. Results demonstrate that using a system-wide policy approach to risk reduction can be more cost-effective than a policy focusing purely on farm-level interventions. Allowing for chemical decontamination methods may enhance cost-effectiveness of intervention strategies further.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the past, a large number of different policies have been implemented to control Campylobacter in the broiler supply chain, but Campylobacter is still among the most common bacterial causes of human gastrointestinal disease infections in many countries (EFSA, 2011; Havelaar et al., 2005). The consequences of human Campylobacter infections are numerous, including human suffering and deaths, medical costs, productivity losses, reduced consumer confidence and restricted market access. It is therefore essential to identify and implement new policy strategies to further reduce the burden of human Campylobacter infections in an effective and economically efficient manner.

During recent years, governments in especially western countries have tended to adopt a farm-to-table systems approach, because food safety failures often arise from problems that are systemic in nature. This is due to problems related to the provision of rights and alignment of incentives (Jensen, 2003; Unnevehr & Jensen, 2005, Chapter 6) and because contemporary food supply chains are characterized by interconnecting stages, implying that safety problems at one stage may easily spread to other parts of the supply chain and hence incur extra costs there. Thus, the analysis of food safety issues should cover all relevant actors in the broiler supply chain from stable to table (Hennessy, Roosen, & Jensen, 2002; Rosenquist, Nielsen, Sommer, Nørrung, & Christensen, 2003).

Several “novel” technologies have been suggested in the literature in order to reduce the incidence of human campylobacteriosis from Campylobacter in broilers (reviewed by Keener, Bashor, Curtis, Sheldon, & Kathariou, 2004). These are based on either a reduction of the number of Campylobacter in the gut of living birds (by changed feeding or by protecting the broiler flocks against contamination from e.g. insects or wild birds), or a reduction of the number of Campylobacter on the chicken carcasses during slaughter using chemical decontamination or physical decontamination methods, such as heat (steam or dry heat) or freezing (including “crust” freezing). The process of Campylobacter spread, as well as the microbiological efficiency of many of these techniques, should be considered as stochastic by nature when it comes to e.g. the prevalence of contaminated birds and in reducing the number of colony forming units (cfu) on the broiler meat (e.g. Nauta, Jacobs-Reitsma, Evers, van Pelt, & Havelaar, 2005; Nauta, van der Ine, & Havelaar, 2005).

From a systemic perspective, it is crucial not only to consider the reduction of Campylobacter risk, but also to investigate the effects of implementing new interventions on the distribution of costs among agents in the broiler supply chain. If firms cannot capture the economic benefits from new costly control measures, they lack the incentives to implement the methods in their production (Jensen, 2003). For example, Mangen, Havelaar, and Poppe (2005), Mangen, Havelaar, Nauta, de Koeijer, and de Wit (2005), Mangen, Havelaar, Bernsen, van Koningsvel, and de Wit (2005) found that the total cost for provision of extra hygiene measures, phage therapy and PCR-tests would cost Dutch broiler farms € 0.05 per bird, with considerable variation across farms. Although these costs may seem low, they are still significant in comparison with the economic margin per broiler. And despite the great importance, the stochastic features have – with few exceptions – either been neglected or poorly addressed in the economic evaluation of new intervention methods.

This study develops and demonstrates a new system-based microbiological–economic modelling approach to evaluate the costs of different intervention portfolios in the broiler supply chain, and to identify cost-effective strategies to reduce the risk of Campylobacter infections when the safety risks and economic incentives for risk reductions are unequally distributed in the chain. The selection of intervention measures is based on farm level results of a Danish epidemiological risk-factor analysis (Sommer & Heuer, 2007; Sommer & Rosenquist, 2011), research concerning the prevention of Campylobacter carrying flies entering the broiler houses (Hald, 2007), literature on Campylobacter risk factors (Bouwknegt et al., 2004; Refregier-Petton, Rose, Denis, & Salvat, 2001), as well as interventions selected in dialogue with industry representatives. Consequently, four intervention methods pertaining to the broiler grow-out houses and their environment are analysed: rodent control, house quality, fly screen and feeding strategy. At the slaughter processing stage four intervention measures are considered, including two mechanical methods (steam-ultrasound treatment, crust freezing), and two chemical decontamination methods (trisodium acids, marinade). The Danish broiler supply chain is used as a case.

Effectiveness and costs of alternative interventions in primary broiler production and in broiler processing are assessed, and systemic intervention strategies combining different types of interventions are developed and analysed. Cost-effectiveness analysis is adopted to compare the intervention strategies, resting on the evaluation of monetized costs relative to outcomes that are expressed in units other than money (Drummond, O’Brien, Stoddart, & Torrance, 1999). In the case of food safety, the physical benefits comprise the number of averted adverse outcomes, e.g. mortality and morbidity hazards. These outcomes are assumed to be correlated with the Campylobacter exposure in terms of the share of meat containing sufficient bacteria concentration to be infectious. Cost-effective strategies are determined using a mathematical programming model, where three scenarios are analysed: (a) only new interventions in primary broiler production are allowed, (b) new interventions are allowed in the primary as well as the processing stage of the chain, and (c) new interventions in both primary and processing stages are allowed, however excluding chemical decontamination of broiler meat in the processing stage.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows: The next section presents the Danish broiler supply chain. Intervention methods and their economic evaluations at the farm and slaughterhouse stages are outlined in the subsequent section, followed by a description of the modelling approach for evaluating cost-effectiveness of strategies to reduce the incidence of Campylobacter. Model results illustrating optimal policy strategies for reduction of Campylobacter risk are presented and discussed in the following section, and some conclusions and perspectives obtained from the study are provided in the final section.

For the study, we had access to primary data from 280 Danish broiler farms for 2004, the base year. The farms had a total of 4383flock rotations, representing 135.8million birds. According to DPC (2005), broilers were reared at the stocking density of 42kilograms live-weight per square meter in 2004. The average growing days were 37days, with a weight gain of 53grams per day. The mortality rate was 3.7% (DPC, 2005).

Based on data from a subsample of farms representing 48% of the Danish broiler flocks and 51% of total broiler production, information on production level, as well as revenue (farm gate price), variable costs and gross margin per broiler is used to describe the economic status of farms (Table 1
                     , left section). Due to heterogeneity of farm sizes and investment in Campylobacter intervention measures, the economic information for the primary broiler sector is divided into small (<2000square meter broiler house capacity), medium-sized (2–4000square meter) and large farms (>4000square meter), respectively.


                     Table 1 (right section), shows the gross margin in the processing stage. During 2004, three slaughter companies with six production units had broiler supplies from the 280 primary producer farms. Apart from the basic price, payment to farmers is to a high degree governed by a number of requirements put forward by the slaughter companies (Lawson, Jensen, & Lund, 2009), including requirements for e.g. delivery weight of birds, product quality, and the welfare of birds measured by the footpad index. Food safety also plays an important role in the determination of the price paid by the slaughter companies to broiler farmers. Salmonella and food-borne livestock disease surveillance and control plans started in 1996/1997 with the associated regulation passed in 1999 (DPC, 2000). Since 2003, all Danish broiler farms should comply with a 10-point bio-security arrangement aimed at production free of food-borne diseases. Farmers are penalized in terms of lower prices, if they fail to fulfill these requirements.

An essential element in evaluating the burden of Campylobacter intervention costs is the gross margin generated at the farm stage and at the slaughterhouse production unit. At the farm level, gross margin amounts to about 15% of the price (with no dramatic differences among farm sizes), and in processing, the average calculated gross margin is 25% of average sales price.

In the literature, various risk analyses have been conducted to estimate or identify possible control intervention measures along the broiler supply chain (Evans & Sayers, 2000; Herman et al., 2003; Nauta, van der Ine, et al., 2005; Rosenquist et al., 2003; van de Giessen, Tilburg, Ritmeester, & van der Plas, 1998). In the following, we briefly describe the control measures analysed in the present study, in terms of their effects on Campylobacter and their cost implications (including which types of costs that are influenced by the respective measures).

In general, the total cost of an intervention measure j is calculated as the sum of annualized capital costs representing long term investments and variable costs, which are directly related to the current production, and which cover feed, labour, materials (e.g. disinfectants) and miscellaneous inputs (e.g. water, energy and maintenance). For all capital investments the annuity cost per year is calculated using an annual inflation-corrected interest rate of 3%. All costs at the farm level were calculated using production information from individual broiler units expressed per broiler. This allows us to estimate the farm-level intervention costs in three farm size groups using statistical methods.


                        Table 2
                         summarizes the partial costs and effectiveness of the four selected intervention types at the farm level. Some of these intervention types (house quality, feeding) have more than one level of intervention. For simplicity, Table 2 only shows the maximum intervention. However, in the subsequent analyses, all intervention levels are taken into account.


                        Rodent control is the provision and regular checks of poison boxes at selected locations around broiler grow-out houses to eliminate rodent intrusion. The study by Sommer and Rosenquist (2011) suggests lacking service of such poison boxes as a risk factor for Campylobacter. The rodent control intervention implies that farms acquire consistent services covering 6–8 annual mouse control checks provided by professional rodent control companies. Cost data associated with the professional rodent control service is provided by the industry (Absolute A/S, 2007; DLG, 2007).


                        Sommer and Rosenquist (2011) found that Campylobacter prevalence on farms is positively correlated with the quality of broiler houses, which is in turn associated with the age of the facility, a finding that has also been supported by other studies (Evans & Sayers, 2000; van de Giessen et al., 1998). Hence, improving the house quality through renovation is expected to reduce the risk of Campylobacter infections among broiler flocks. We have estimated the cost of renovating the existing grow-out houses in terms of investment costs associated with the ante-room, floor, port, feeding inventory and lost production (Danpo, 2007), for grow-out houses aged over 29, 9 and 4years, respectively. Houses in very poor condition are assumed to require full replacement covering building, inventory and sanitation (DPC, 2005). A lifespan of 10years for renovation of grow-out houses and 20years for a new housing system was assumed. Hence, we have four age classes of houses and the investment represents the costs of upgrading from one level to a higher level.

Large numbers of chimneys and other openings on grow-out houses imply higher exposure to vector-carrier flies introducing Campylobacter to broilers kept indoors (Hald, 2007; Hald, Bang, Dybdahl, & Madsen, 2004), and hence are positively correlated with the prevalence of Campylobacter in the broiler flocks (Sommer & Rosenquist, 2011). Fly-screen netting of broiler houses involves netting the openings to prevent this exposure. The cost attributed to fly-screen netting covers fixed and variable expenses, including cover water, electricity, disinfectant solution and labour for cleaning periodically after each rotation, as well as annuity costs of investment, assuming a depreciation period of 10years (Lawson et al., 2009).

The standard feed plan is basically composed of concentrate and whole-grain wheat feedstuffs. However, introducing whole-grain wheat early during the grow-out period is biologically expected to dampen the growth of Campylobacter in digestive traits in the case of infection (Sommer & Rosenquist, 2011). Using partial budgeting, the costs of the required grams of whole-grain wheat are estimated as the required quantity multiplied by the difference between concentrate feed price and the whole-grain wheat prices (Lawson et al., 2009). Replacing the high percentage of concentrate feed with whole-grain wheat provides a cost saving, because whole-grain wheat has a lower price than concentrate feed.

According to Table 2, Campylobacter prevalence tends to be lower in smaller broiler farms (29.3%), compared to large and medium-sized farms (34.3% and 35.5%, respectively). Upgrading rodent control from self-service to professional rodent control reduces the average prevalence by 5.97% points, at an additional cost of 0.12eurocents per broiler. Fly-screen netting and improved quality of grow-out houses tend to be the most effective farm-level interventions in terms of reducing Campylobacter prevalence, but they are also relatively costly, compared to professional rodent control and early feeding with whole-grain wheat.


                        Steam-ultrasound decontamination is a relatively new technology combining the effect of hot steam and high-frequency ultrasound to control micro-organisms. Steam-ultrasound is generated by specially designed nozzles simultaneously supplying the right dose of steam and creating the ultrasound. It is well suited for very sensitive products that do not tolerate high temperatures (Boysen & Rosenquist, 2009; Force Technology, 2007). Steam-ultrasound decontamination involves costs in terms of capital investment, water and energy, whereas labour requirements remain unaffected.


                        Chemical decontamination with Trisodium phosphate involves spraying the surface of the broiler carcasses with acid solution (TSP, 10% weight/volume at 25°C rinse) for 15seconds to inactivate Campylobacter, while the carcass passes through the processing line. It requires capital investments and variable expenses, including acid solution, labour, water and energy to heat the acid solution (Lawson et al., 2009).


                        Crust freezing is the process by which e.g. fillets and whole carcasses are quickly frozen just before chilling. Afterwards, the temperature is allowed to equilibrate as the carcasses progress through the chillers (Kennedy & Miller, 2004). Capital investment for crust freezing includes purchase, installation, and re-organisational costs, whereas the method has no significant influence on variable costs.


                        Marinating is the process by which a brine composed of water, chemicals, salt and acids, e.g. tartaric acid (6%), is used to marinate broiler fillets, etc. Marinating with these acids for 20minutes is expected to inhibit bacteria in the final product for consumption (Birk et al., 2010). Facilities to marinate are assumed to exist on abattoirs, and therefore no extra investment costs are required, whereas some variable cost is expected per broiler (mainly marinade).


                        Table 3
                         contains information about the estimated reductions in cfu-concentration and associated costs for each considered intervention method at the processing stage.

According to Table 3, steam-ultrasound tends to be the most effective of the four post-slaughter methods to reduce Campylobacter concentration in broiler meat, with a mean reduction of 2.51log units and a standard deviation of 0.58log-units. The two chemical methods can reduce Campylobacter concentration significantly, whereas crust freezing has relatively limited effect. Mechanical decontamination methods (steam-ultrasound, crust freezing) tend to be more costly than chemical methods (TSP, marinating), but the effectiveness of the chemical methods also tend to exhibit larger variation than the mechanical methods.

The effectiveness and cost parameters for different interventions outlined in the previous section provide a basis for establishing partial cost-effectiveness estimates regarding the respective individual interventions by taking the ratio between cost and effectiveness parameters. According to such estimates, early feeding with whole-grain wheat and professional rodent control are the most cost-effective farm level interventions, and TSP decontamination and marinating are the most cost-effective abattoir-level intervention methods. However, for assessing system-wide strategies for reduced Campylobacter risk, it is necessary to take into account the potential contributions of these intervention types to the reduction in overall human exposure to Campylobacter risk in chicken. The following outlines an economic mathematical programming model developed for this purpose. The model comprises three stages: domestic primary production at the farm stage, the domestic processing stage and the market stage, where both domestically produced and imported broilers are traded.

As mentioned in the previous section, a microbiological risk factor study by Sommer and Rosenquist (2011) has identified a number of risk factors at the farm stage for three farm size categories. Four of these risk factors are considered modifiable via policy interventions: rodent control, house quality, fly screens and feeding. We model these four types of interventions as ordered categorical variables.

The effects of interventions on these risk factors can now be simulated by “moving” broiler houses from one combination of risk factors to another level with lower risk (Sommer & Rosenquist, 2011). For example, the effects of a mandatory professional rodent control can be estimated by replacing all houses in each risk factor combination without professional rodent control with the most similar risk factor combination with such rodent control (for example the combination {r
                     =0,
                     h
                     =2,
                     s
                     =0,
                     f
                     =1,
                     d
                     =1,
                     m
                     =0} with the combination {r
                     =1,
                     h
                     =2,
                     s
                     =0,
                     f
                     =1,

                     m
                     =0}). Hence, the prevalence effect of mandatory rodent control in farm size category g can be calculated by weighted summation over all combinations of the other five risk factors, i.e.

Note that for the multilevel risk factors house quality and feeding strategy, there may be more than one level of intervention, e.g. upgrading from level 0 to level 1, 2 or 3, and summation is done over all these types of upgrades. In a similar way, the aggregate cost impact per broiler at the farm level is calculated as

We assume that Campylobacter preventing interventions are irreversible at the broiler house level, and that the associated costs can be considered as sunk costs. Thus, intervention strategies can at best lead to unchanged costs, but will normally increase costs (i.e. the farmer cannot save costs by downgrading his level of expected Campylobacter prevalence). Whereas this may be reasonable for investment costs, it might seem restrictive for e.g. feeding strategies or professional rodent control, although this is considered to be of minor importance for the results due to relatively low costs associated with these intervention types.

The broiler processing stage is assumed to receive broilers from the farming stage, where the share of Campylobacter-positive broilers is represented by the flock prevalence. In positive birds entering the slaughterhouses, the concentration Q of bacteria (cfu/ml) is assumed to be described by a log normal distribution

This post-slaughter distribution of Campylobacter concentration can be affected by additional decontamination interventions, e.g. mechanical treatment (crust freezing, steam-ultrasound) or chemical treatment (decontamination, marinade) of carcasses. It is assumed that broiler meat from the processing stage is distributed to the consumers as either chilled or frozen. As freezing hampers the concentration of Campylobacter in broiler meat, broilers for chilled distribution are selected from flocks with relatively low farm-level prevalence.

The effect of intervention i on log10-concentration is described by the mean

                      of the effect (cf. Table 3). Assuming that the effects of abattoir-level interventions are additive, the post-intervention Campylobacter concentration is given by adding the post-slaughter (but before intervention) concentration and the effect of the applied interventions, which depends on the share vi
                      of carcasses treated with the respective intervention. Using summation rules for independent stochastic variables, the distribution of log10-concentration in Campylobacter positive broilers after interventions is

Hence, if an intervention exhibits a large mean reduction in concentration and a large standard deviation, the resulting concentration from introducing this intervention will have a lower mean value but a larger standard deviation than before the intervention. It should be noted that the assumption of additivity may be unrealistic because of overlaps in the effects of different decontamination methods. Hence, adding the partial effects of different intervention methods may lead to an over-estimation of the “true” effect.

                     , i.e. the probability of finding broiler meat where the concentration of Campylobacter is large enough to be detectable. This depends positively on the farm level prevalence and on Campylobacter concentration after the slaughtering and post-slaughtering processes, as well as on the temperature management during transport and storing along the way from slaughterhouse to consumer. For simplicity, we abstract from potential cross-contamination and failures in temperature management. In some of the contaminated meat, the concentration exceeds the threshold level

The exposure measure in expression (6) combines exposures from flock prevalence in broiler farms, Campylobacter concentration in positive broiler carcasses and Campylobacter exposure from imported broiler meat into one composite risk measure. Hence the risk measure deviates from the approaches by Jensen and Unnevehr (2000, Chapter 3) and Malcolm, Narrod, Roberts, and Ollinger (2004), who focus on bacteria concentration in meat processing, or Vosough et al. (2006) and Van der Gaag, Saatkamp, Backus Ge, Beek, and Huirne (2004) focussing on farm-level prevalence. Mangen, Havelaar, Bernsen, et al. (2005) use the number of human cases and changes in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY’s), which is somewhat comparable to our measure of consumer risk, but they ignore risks from imported meat.

In this model setup, cost-effectiveness analysis can be conducted by minimizing the aggregate cost of the broiler supply chain ΔC

Solving this constrained cost minimization problem yields the cost-effective strategy under these conditions. These solutions can be compared across risk reduction goals and across policy scenarios reflecting alternative sets of acceptable intervention methods.

The integrated biological-economic model framework includes several features, which distinguishes it from previous studies. Firstly, it includes the primary production stage and its close linkages with the abattoirs in the broiler supply chain, and consumers’ exposure to Campylobacter as a result of this interplay, combining farm-level prevalence and product-level concentrations which only few studies have previously done (Mangen, Havelaar, Nauta, et al., 2005; Mangen, Havelaar, et al., 2005; Van der Gaag et al., 2004; Vosough, Velthuis, Hogenveen, & Huirne, 2006). Secondly, we consider the approach to modelling interventions in primary production to be quite novel, but suitable for the purpose. Thirdly, some of the stochastic characteristics of novel interventions to combat Campylobacter are explicitly captured in the economic model. And fourthly, the model depicts the production structure in small countries with important market interactions between domestic production, consumption and foreign trade, which may have great impacts on the safety of the food that consumers buy and eat, and on producers’ economic possibilities to introduce risk-reducing interventions. It should be noted that the model does not account for contamination during transport from farm to processing, and that the applied modelling of human campylobacteriosis risk is relatively simple, as compared with more sophisticated – but more data-demanding – dose–response relationships (Teunis et al., 2005). Hence, the determination of human health risk may be somewhat uncertain. Nevertheless, the applied approach is considered to yield results of a quality that is sufficient for assessment of the cost-effectiveness of alternative intervention strategies.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In order to demonstrate the empirical model outlined in the previous section, we evaluate three intervention strategies (combinations of interventions) to reduce Campylobacter risk in the Danish broiler supply chain. In the first strategy, it is assumed that only interventions in primary broiler production are acceptable. This is motivated by a common attitude that the raw materials in food supply should be as “clean as possible”, and that any decontamination is unacceptable (Korzen, Sandøe, & Lassen, 2011). In the second intervention strategy, we assume that all the described interventions are possible in the primary as well as in the processing sector. Finally, the third intervention strategy includes all potential interventions in both primary and processing sectors, however excluding chemical decontamination of broiler meat in the processing stage, which many people consider unacceptable (Korzen et al., 2011), and where no chemicals have yet been approved for decontamination in the EU (BIOHAZ, 2011).

The model is calibrated on the Danish data as outlined in previous sections. For baseline Campylobacter concentration levels in the abattoir stage, the parameters

                      are estimated to be 1.85 and 1.06, respectively (Christensen, Sommer, Rosenquist, & Nielsen, 2001). We assume that 45% of the domestically produced broiler meat sold on the Danish market is distributed as chilled meat (Danish Food Agency, 2012), and that the average flock prevalence of broilers allocated to this line of processing is 50% of the average prevalence for flocks allocated to freezed distribution, due to pre-slaughter sorting. For broilers allocated to frozen distribution, freezing is assumed to reduce the mean concentration by 1.38log-units (S.D. 0.668) (Rosenquist, Sommer, Nielsen, & Christensen, 2006). The concentration threshold

                     , where health effects are likely to occur, is assumed to be 500colony-forming units per milliliter, which implies that one drop of meat juice contains enough Campylobacter bacteria to be infectious (Teunis et al., 2005). The import share of broiler meat in Danish consumption M is approximately 20% in the baseline setting, and the exogenous exposure level in imported broilers Rm
                      is assumed to be 0.20 (EFSA, 2011), corresponding to slightly more than double the level in domestically produced broilers. The price elasticity ɛ, representing cross-price effects between domestic price and broiler imports was econometrically estimated to be −10.0 on the basis of Eurostat market balance data for broiler meat and broiler meat prices in Denmark and Germany – the latter being one the major European markets for broiler meat.

In Table 4
                     , the minimized intervention costs and associated food risk effects of the three strategies are presented, including results concerning food safety improvement (farm level prevalence, concentration and aggregate Campylobacter exposure) and aggregate costs for the Danish broiler supply chain. In order to compare cost-effectiveness across the three strategies, they are all scaled to obtain the same aggregate Campylobacter exposure reduction (about 25%) in domestically produced broiler meat.


                     Flock prevalence in primary production represents the expected share of Campylobacter positive flocks in the population of primary broiler producers in the respective scenarios. The Average log10concentration from processing represents the average logarithm of Campylobacter concentration in positive broiler carcasses leaving the abattoir (after post-slaughter treatment). Risk exposure, domestically produced broilers combines flock prevalence from primary production and concentration in positive meat from abattoirs into the risk level as determined by expression (5) above. Aggregate retail-level risk exposure (incl imports) represents the probability of finding broiler meat with above-threshold Campylobacter concentration in Danish retail stores, taking imported broiler meat into account, cf. expression (6). Human campylobacteriosis risk represents the human probability of becoming ill from a Campylobacter infection. Aggregate costs are obtained as the sum of farm sector costs (2) and processing sector costs (4).

Overall, the results suggest that the additional costs related to reduced Campylobacter risk in broiler products are relatively small, compared to total production costs, and these costs constitute a little less than 1% of the farmers’ gross margin for this considered 25% risk reduction goal. Hence, for moderate risk reduction policy goals, these intervention strategies are unlikely to lead to major increases in the consumer prices for broiler meat. A corresponding finding was obtained by Unnevehr and Jensen (2005) with regard to abattoir-level decontamination of beef and pork, whereas Mangen, Havelaar, et al. (2005) and Mangen, Havelaar, Nauta, et al. (2005) found somewhat higher costs, which were however also related to a more ambitious intervention strategy.

If we pursue a “clean raw material” strategy (strategy 1), the annual cost of obtaining the considered reduction in risk exposure – in terms of reduced farm level prevalence from 33.8% to 24.5% – will amount to 199.000 euros for the primary sector (corresponding to about 0.15eurocents per broiler). For moderate risk reductions, selected interventions in this strategy mainly include improvement of house quality and earlier feeding with whole-grain wheat.

If we instead pursue a “whole-chain” strategy (strategy 2), the same reduction in risk exposure may be obtained at a significantly lower aggregate cost (about 65% of the costs associated with strategy 1). The structure of the reduction however deviates from strategy 1 in that the prevalence remains almost unaffected, but the level of Campylobacter concentration in broiler meat becomes lower due to the interventions, which mainly comprise chemical post-slaughter decontamination. Thus, so concentration constitutes the main contribution to risk reduction in this strategy.

Abandoning chemical interventions (strategy 3) will increase the cost of control, compared to strategy 2 – but the costs are still lower than for strategy 1. In this strategy, the main interventions still occur in the processing stage (steam-ultrasound treatment), but it will be cost-effective to undertake some minor adjustments in the primary sector too, mainly professionalizing rodent control and earlier feeding with whole-grain wheat, where this can be done at a low cost. Hence, Campylobacter risk can be reduced at a lower cost, if concerns for “clean raw materials” and “non-chemical” decontamination processes are ignored.

It should be noted that the results in Table 4 represent moderate risk reduction goals. In Fig. 1
                     , the effects and costs of different reduction levels are considered for the three strategies.

Costs become higher, the lower is the desired level of risk exposure, which is in line with a priori expectations. For strategy 1, this increase is rather significant, and reducing the risk exposure level in domestically produced broilers by three quarters will increase the average cost per broiler by an amount corresponding to 10% of the gross margin. The cost increase for more substantial reductions is less dramatic in strategies 2 and 3.

For all three strategies, the cost curves show a convex curvature, indicating that the marginal costs of risk reduction are increasing, especially with regard to strategies 1 and 3, where farm-level interventions play a significant role. Two features of the economic model explain this convexity. For the farm-level intervention strategy (strategy 1) – and to some extent the mixed strategy 3 – the convexity stems from the fact that for moderate reductions, it is possible to leave out the most costly interventions to some extent, but for more ambitious reduction goals, the most costly interventions (such as modernization of grow-out houses and investment in fly screens) need to be included to a larger extent (cf. Fig. 2
                     ).

For interventions at the abattoir level (strategy 2 and 3), the explanation for the convexity relates to the modelled impacts of interventions on the Campylobacter concentration distribution. In particular, increasing the intensity of an intervention (e.g. decontamination by steam-ultrasound technology) leads to a reduction of the concentration mean value, but at the same time increases the standard deviation of the Campylobacter concentration, cf. expression (3). As we evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies in terms of the food risk exposure measure given by expression (5) (i.e. the probability of finding broiler meat with concentration above 500colony-forming units per milliliter), the intervention-induced increase in standard deviation to some extent undermines the effectiveness of the intervention, and hence requires increasing intervention intensity relative to the targeted risk reduction effect. This effect is most pronounced for steam-ultrasound decontamination, where the effectiveness exhibits a relatively large standard deviation, cf. Table 3.

It is also noteworthy that the potential cost saving from including abattoir-level interventions in a Campylobacter risk reduction strategy becomes more pronounced for more ambitious reduction goals, primarily because the potentials for relatively low-cost risk reduction interventions at the farm level become exhausted already for moderate reductions in farm-level Campylobacter prevalence.

As a significant share of domestic broiler meat consumption stems from imports, Campylobacter control in domestic production cannot entirely remove the problem for the consumers. The correspondence between Campylobacter risk exposure in domestically produced and consumed broiler meat, respectively, is shown in Fig. 3
                     . As mentioned previously, imported broiler meat constitutes around 20% of total Danish consumption in the baseline, and this part of the consumption is not affected by the considered interventions in domestic broiler production. For this reason, Campylobacter exposure reduction in consumed meat is less than proportional to the reduction in domestically produced meat.

When costly interventions to reduce Campylobacter risk in domestic production are imposed, the average unit cost of domestic broiler meat increases relative to imported meat, and this leads to substitution of domestic meat with imported, cf. expression (7). If strategy 1 is pursued for ambitious reduction goals (to a level below 3% in domestically produced broilers), the intervention costs may increase the price of domestically produced broilers to an extent that will increase the exposure level faced by consumers, because such a price increase induces the share of imported broiler meat in consumption to increase dramatically (to more than 50%, compared to 20% in the baseline).

The above results report costs for the farmer-processing chain as a whole, as well as for the two separate stages of the chain, with the farm sector bearing the costs in strategy 1 and the abattoirs bearing the costs in strategy 2 and the majority of costs in strategy 3. If lower Campylobacter levels can result in higher consumer prices, derived from consumers’ willingness to pay for lower risk, the processors may reap the gains from such higher pricing. From a chain perspective, these gains and burdens can be redistributed through pricing and the formation of contracts between farmers and processors. Various such payments schemes may be imagined, e.g. payments conditional on the implementation of preventive measures versus payments conditional on actual Campylobacter prevalence, or price premiums versus other types of transfer between the stages of the supply chain. However, whereas the present analysis indicates magnitudes for the scope of such payments, it does not point out specific payment vehicles.

This paper develops a microbiological–economic model framework for assessing the system-wide costs and risk reduction effects of alternative Campylobacter control strategies. The model is capable of determining cost-effective combinations of interventions for given risk reduction aims and policy assumptions, and of comparing costs and cost-effectiveness across alternative policy settings.

Quantitative results suggest that a risk reduction policy limiting itself to interventions in primary production implies costs between 0.5% and 5% of current gross margins in primary broiler production – dependent on the risk reduction goals. This cost may be substantially reduced, if decontamination – including chemical decontamination (TSP) – at the abattoir level is accepted. On the other hand, if only mechanical decontamination is accepted, cost savings of 30–70% may be achieved, compared with a farm-level only strategy. A major reason for the relatively high cost for obtaining substantial risk reduction via pure farm-level interventions is the fact that the range of cost-effective intervention methods in primary production is more or less exhausted already. A cost increase at up to 5% of current gross margin may seem a small extra cost. However, taking into consideration that the vast majority of Danish broiler production is exported to markets with fierce price competition, such a cost increase may lead to significant losses of export opportunities, and this may undermine the industry’s incentive to undertake such measures.

In addition to cost-effectiveness’ importance on export markets, the quantitative results also demonstrate that cost-effectiveness is important on the domestic market, if substitution of domestic products with imported broiler meat should not undermine the planned risk reduction for domestic consumers.

The results of the present study supports results of previous studies (e.g. Unnevehr & Jensen, 2005), which suggest that a policy setting microbial hazard limits for food products may be more cost-effective than command and control regulation setting specific standards and requirements to production technologies, specific raw materials and intermediate products, etc.

Although the demonstrated economic model exhibits some novel features for analysing cost-effectiveness of different food safety strategies, the framework can still be developed further. One avenue for such development could be a more detailed description of the processes during slaughtering, including risks of cross-contamination between broiler carcasses – an aspect that has not been included in the present model due to lack of suitable data. Also cross-contamination during transport could be an aspect worthy of further development within the modelling framework. Inclusion of cross-contamination effects might change the outcome of the cost-effectiveness analyses, for example by reducing the effectiveness of farm-level interventions on risk exposure in the final product. As mentioned earlier, for simplicity and due to lack of relevant data, we have assumed that effects and costs of the interventions are additive. In case of overlaps between effects of different interventions, this assumption may also tend to imply an over-estimation of the cost-effectiveness. In the analysis, we have assumed perfect transmission of the costs into consumer price of domestically produced broiler meat. More careful modelling of this price transmission, including effects of market structure, would be another avenue for further development of the analytical framework. Another element that could be developed further is the consumer stage, including costs of various risk handling strategies in home kitchens. Moreover, careful modelling of dose–response relationships between Campylobacter exposure from broilers and risk of human campylobacteriosis could be useful for more precise assessments of human health risk. Also the international trade aspect, which may have important implications for both the costs and the effectiveness of various risk reduction strategies may be a direction for further research, and so may the introduction of potential new intervention methods, e.g. vaccination, phage therapy, etc.
