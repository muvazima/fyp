                  We consider a general model for scheduling jobs on unrelated parallel-machines with maintenance interventions. The processing times are deteriorating with their position in the production sequence and the goal of the maintenance is to help to restore good processing conditions. The maintenance duration is depending on the time elapsed since the last maintenance intervention.
                  Several performance criteria and different maintenance systems have been proposed in the literature, leading basically to assignment problems as the underlying model. We shall inverse the approach and start first to set up the matrix for the assignment problems, which catches all the information for the production-maintenance system. This can be done for very general processing times and maintenance durations.
                  The solutions to the assignment problems are determined first. They define the order in which the jobs are to be processed on the various machines and only then the vital informations about the schedule are retrieved, like completion and maintenance times. It will be shown that these matrices are easily obtained, and this approach does not necessitate any complex calculations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

We consider production systems with position-dependent processing times, where the processing of a job depends on its position in the schedule. Such deterioration effects in scheduling problems were introduced in Mosheiov (2001a, 2001b) and since then considered in Chang, Chen, and Mani (2009), Ji and Cheng (2009), Lai and Lee (2010), Rudek (2012), Rustogi and Strusevich (2012a), and Wang (2007).

To counteract the effect of deteriorating, the machines may need maintenance for improving their production efficiency. Usually, the machines return to their initial ideal processing conditions after a maintenance activity. In the literature, it is often assumed that the maintenance duration is constant. Kubzin and Strusevich (2005) introduced a new model in which the length of the maintenance period depends on its starting time. This model has received increasing attention, see for example Kubzin and Strusevich (2006), Rustogi and Strusevich (2012a) and Hsu, Ji, Guo, and Yang (2013).


                     Hsu, Cheng, and Yang (2011) studied the minimization of the total completion time TC with a fixed maintenance duration. They introduced a polynomial time algorithm whenever the number of machines is fixed. More recently Yang, Hsu, and Yang (2014) proposed a more efficient solution algorithm for this problem. The minimization of the total machine load TML, the total absolute differences in completion times TADC and the total absolute differences in waiting times TADW has been studied in several papers, see Cheng, Hsu, and Yang (2011), Wang, Wang, and Liu (2011), Wang and Wei (2011) and Hsu et al. (2013). All these problems can be solved optimally in polynomial time, and the standard solution approach uses a series of linear assignment problems.

In this paper, we focus on unrelated parallel machine scheduling problems with simultaneous processing deterioration effects and maintenance activities on each machine. In many previous studies specific analytic functions are defined for the processing times. We shall instead assume arbitrary real-valued functions that just catch the deterioration effect. Then we emphasize the structure of the matrix for the assignment problems and the fact that their solutions define a permutation and is a sum-minimization. The matrices are containing implicitly all informations about the production-maintenance system and can be obtained without developing complicated formulas. The models from the literature are special cases of our general setting.

In Section 2 we first consider unrelated parallel-machine systems without maintenance interventions. In Section 3 we rely on the novel concept of weighted maintenance activity from Finke, Gara-Ali, Espinouse, Jost, and Moncel (2013) and extend the results from Gara-Ali, Espinouse, and Finke (2014) where a single maintenance takes place on each machine. It will be shown that the corresponding matrices for the assignment problems are easily set up and the procedure is applicable to general processing times, to general weighted maintenance and to various performance criteria proposed in the literature. In this general setting, one obtains the same algorithmic complexities. For the case of the minimization of the total machine load TML, the complexity is improved in Section 3.3. Several extensions of the problem are given in Section 3.4.

There are n jobs to be scheduled on m unrelated parallel machines Rm, where m is the number of machines. The processing time for job j (

                      (see Yang & Yang, 2013). In Rustogi and Strusevich (2012a), Rustogi and Strusevich (2012b) a more general form is given: pjg(r) and pjgj
                     (r). These processing times are deteriorating if a, aj, bj
                      > 0, σ, σj
                      > 1 and g(r), gj
                     (r) are nondecreasing functions in r, whereas we have a learning effect if a, aj, bj
                      < 0, 0 < σ, σj
                      < 1 and g(r), gj
                     (r) are nonincreasing.

In this article, we do not assume any particular analytical form, but rather require that in the given production system one can evaluate in constant time the processing times.

Let us first concentrate on the classical linear assignment problem, which will be the main underlying model. We have an n × n table of cost values {cij
                     }, and we want to solve the following linear program

                     . We can now adapt the assignment problem to this triple-index case. Suppose an arbitrary function f(l, j, r) is given, no particular analytical form is required. We set up an n × n table of values {f(l, j, r)}, where the n rows correspond to the jobs and where the first n

                           Remark 1
                           
                              Theorem 1 is formulated for the most common criteria γ, but applies in fact to many other cases. One only requires to have matrix entries f(l, j, r) in terms of processing times p(l, j, r) and an objective function γ in terms of f(l, j, r) that is machine decomposable. For instance one may take linear combinations of our five standard criteria. One may also vary the criteria γl
                               and take different criteria for the machines l.

The simplest criterion is TML where the complexity can be improved substantially, if we assume that the positional processing times p(l, j, r) are deteriorating with the rank on each machine, i.e.,

A direct solution approach is to model the problem as assignment problem of size (mn) × (mn). Here the first n rows belong to the given jobs with processing times p(l, j, r), where job i is candidate to be placed in any of the n positions on any of the m machines. The remaining 
                           
                              (
                              m
                              −
                              1
                              )
                              n
                           
                         rows are fictitious jobs with processing times equal to zero. Now consider an optimal solution of this assignment problem and drop all fictitious jobs. Notice that fictitious jobs are the last jobs on each machine (or can be shifted to these positions if there are real jobs of zero length). We get the complexity O(m

                        n

As pointed out in Finke et al. (2013), there are two different algorithms to solve rectangular assignment problems. The approach from Burkard, Dell’Amico, and Martello (2009) has complexity O(qn
                        2) and the second method from Dinic (1976) and Milo et al. (2013) has complexity 
                           
                              O

                              )

                         which is more efficient.

We use a rectangular assignment problem 
                           RAP
                         of size n × (mn), consisting only of the real jobs, to solve problem R|p(l, j, r)|TML. We get the complexity

                        . In this model each job (row) is assigned to exactly one position (column) and in each of the mn columns at most one job is located. Again, the jobs are selected in adjacent ranks in an optimal solution, starting with rank

                         on each machine because of the deteriorating property of processing times (4) that we have imposed, or the jobs can be shifted to such positions without losing the optimality since the entries satisfy

Therefore, problem R|p(l, j, r)|TML is solvable in polynomial time. The complexity reduces to O(n
                        3) if m is constant, see also Mosheiov (2012).

In an environment with positional processing times and maintenance it is assumed that the processing times p(l, j, r) are deteriorating with the rank on each machine (4).

Maintenance periods are inserted from time to time to return to good processing conditions.

We follow Finke et al. (2013) and define a very general maintenance system

                         of jobs in group i; Gr
                        1 combines the jobs since the start time 0 to the first maintenance period) with the subsequent maintenance period i. Whenever job j is processed in rank r on machine l within Gri
                         the subsequent maintenance period i requires the time w(l, j, r)p(l, j, r) to restore the initial processing condition for job j, in addition to some constant time

(Criterion TML)

This is the simplest criterion and later a more efficient solution method is given. We can easily incorporate the maintenance times by augmenting the processing times p(l, j, s) of job j by the maintenance time for this job w(l, j, s)p(l, j, s), required in the following maintenance period. Thus the entries of matrices 
                           
                              M

                              l
                           
                         are independent of the ranks 
                           
                              r

(Criterion TC)

This criterion and also the other criteria are given in terms of job completion times. We know that all completion times of jobs on machine l, following the first maintenance period, should be augmented by the duration of the first maintenance, then completion times of jobs after the second maintenance should in addition also be augmented by the duration of the second maintenance, and so on. Therefore one gets for each group

There is the following special case. We assume that there are

                           Remark 2
                           One can also extend Theorem 4 to more general functions γ, as in Remark 1. The multiplicity factors λγ
                               are known for each of the standard criteria γ. Hence it is easy to set up matrix Ma
                               for linear combinations of the five standard criteria, and one may eventually vary the criterion for the different machines.

The complexity for the criterion TML can again be improved by using the rectangular assignment problem. We eliminate the numbers nl
                         and the vector ul
                         and extend each group 
                           
                              G
                              
                                 r
                                 i
                                 l

The solutions to the rectangular assignment problems 
                           RAP
                         are to be translated into feasible schedules. The processing times p(l, j, r) and weights w(l, j, r) are machine dependent, but the maintenance constants

A simple subcase concerns the pure variable maintenance, where all 
                           
                              
                                 β

                                 l

                              0
                           
                        . One can attribute all k maintenance periods to each of the m machines. Then a maintenance period has length 0 if it follows directly some other maintenance. The actual number of maintenance periods on machine l can always be augmented to k by adding zero-length maintenance periods. Hence we have to solve for each k a single rectangular assignment problem of size n × (mkn) in 
                           
                              O

                              k
                              )
                           
                         using Dinic (1976) and Milo et al. (2013). The number k of non-zero maintenance periods can be limited to k ≤ n. Therefore, we set 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              n
                           
                         and solve a single rectangular assignment problem in O(mn
                        3). Then we drop all zero-length maintenance periods and obtain the optimal number of non-zero maintenance interventions.

                              where we want to find the best number k of maintenance interventions. This problem can be modeled as a single rectangular assignment problem and solved in O(mn
                              3) time.
                           

We have assumed deteriorating processing times (4) and weights (5). These properties were formally only used in Sections 2.2 and 3.3. Since in all other cases the size of the submatrices are imposed, the assignment algorithm will fill all positions optimally, independent of conditions on deterioration. Therefore, one may delete conditions (4) and (5). For instance, the processing times may first improve in the lower ranks and only later on deteriorate.

Finally we give a last extension of the production-maintenance system. Without any complication, one can vary for each group 
                           
                              G
                              
                                 r
                                 i
                                 l
                              
                           
                         processing times and weights to p
                        (i)(l, j, r) and w
                        (i)(l, j, r). In fact, it was nowhere imposed to have the same functions in each group i. This generalizes the idea in Rustogi and Strusevich (2012a), Rustogi and Strusevich (2012b) of group dependent deterioration (the maintenance is not fully returning the system to the initial ideal processing conditions). However our setting is more general since no particular correlation of p
                        (i)(l, j, r) and w
                        (i)(l, j, r) between different groups is imposed. One may just have another processing-maintenance environment, for instance different maintenance crews and different production operators. Hence Theorem 4 remains valid for this extension. The same polynomial complexity 
                           
                              O

                        m and k constant, is given in Rustogi and Strusevich (2012a) for the criterion TC.

Solving large numbers of assignment problems is the worst situation where one just enumerates all possible combinations. In practice, one has an interest to limit this number by imposing some regularity, for instance one may have only a certain restricted number of jobs before the next maintenance should take place.

However, the complexity O(n
                        3) of solving a full assignment problem can be replaced with the complexity O(n log n) of sorting if processing times are decomposable, i.e., they are of the form
