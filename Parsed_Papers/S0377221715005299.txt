                  In a recently published paper by Liu et al. [Liu, F., Zhang, W.G., Wang, Z.X. (2012). A goal programming model for incomplete interval multiplicative preference relations and its application in group decision-making. European Journal of Operational Research 218, 747–754], two equations are introduced to define consistency of incomplete interval multiplicative preference relations (IMPRs) and employed to develop a goal programming model for estimating missing values. This note illustrates that such consistency definition and estimation model are technically incorrect. New transitivity conditions are proposed to define consistent IMPRs, and a two-stage goal programming approach is devised to estimate missing values for incomplete IMPRs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The interval multiplicative preference relation (IMPR) introduced by Saaty and Vargas (1987) is a powerful and efficient tool for expressing decision-makers’ (DMs’) pairwise judgments with uncertainty, and has been used to model uncertainty in multi-criteria decision analysis (Durbach & Stewart, 2012). On the other hand, because of complexity of decision problems and the limited ability of human pairwise comparisons, DMs may be unable to provide their preferences over some pairs of decision alternatives. As such, incomplete judgments are resulted and decision making problems with incomplete preference relations have been received more and more attention in recent years (Mattila & Virtanen, 2015; Punkka & Salo, 2013; Wang & Li, 2015). The consistency of preference relations is a crucial foundation for estimating missing values and obtaining a reasonable and reliable decision result (Brunelli, Canal, & Fedrizzi, 2013; Brunelli & Fedrizzi, 2015; Kou, Ergu, & Shang, 2014). In order to characterize inconsistency indices for pairwise comparison matrices, Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2014) put forward five axioms. One of them is the invariance with respect to permutations of decision alternatives.

In a recent paper, Liu et al. (2012) introduced two equations to define consistency of incomplete IMPRs, and developed a goal programming model to estimate missing values. However, a close investigation demonstrates that such consistency definition is highly dependent on alternative labels and not robust to permutations of decision alternatives, and the goal programming model suffers from serious drawbacks. The aim of this note is to point out and correct errors in the consistency definition and the goal programming model.

The pairwise judgments are usually expressed on the 1-9 Saaty's scale, i.e.

                      is referred to as an incomplete IMPR. Obviously, the missing values may be lower or/and upper bounds of interval judgments.

                      is an inconsistent and incomplete IMPR.


                     Example 1 clearly indicates that, for the identical judgment information with different labeling for alternatives, Definition 2.1 yields contradictory results. In other words, Definition 2.1 is not robust to permutations of decision alternatives. From the viewpoint of the pairwise comparison, the consistency of preference relations should be independent of alternative labels such that it has the invariance with respect to permutations of decision alternatives. Therefore, Definition 2.1 by Liu et al. (2012) is technically incorrect.

In addition, incomplete IMPRs with extremely inconsistent judgments may be determined as consistent IMPRs as per Definition 2.1. Moreover, incorrect results may be obtained when the matrices Cand D defined by (2.1) are used to check acceptability and estimate missing values for incomplete IMPRs.

                      should be less than or equal to 1/4. Clearly, the results obtained by (2.2) are incorrect.

As per the concept of acceptable IMPRs by Liu et al. (2012) (see Definition 8 on page 749), one can obtain that 
                        
                           
                              A
                              ¯
                           
                           2
                        
                      is unacceptable and 
                        
                           
                              A
                              ¯
                           
                           3
                        
                      is acceptable, implying that a consistent IMPR may be unacceptable and an acceptably incomplete IMPR may not be complemented. Therefore, the acceptability definition by Liu et al. (2012) suffers from serious defects and its applications should be very cautious.

Based on (2.2), Liu et al. (2012) put forward the following model (see Liu et al. (2012), (LOP2) on page 749) to estimate missing values for incomplete IMPRs whose judgments are given by the DM under the 1-9 Saaty's scale.

                      is the interval ratio of the alternative x
                     2 over x
                     4, and

                      is also the interval ratio of x
                     2 over x
                     4. Thus, inconsistent results are obtained from the same judgment information by applying (2.3). The computation results demonstrate that the model (2.3) depends on alternative labels and is not robust to permutations of decision alternatives. Therefore, the goal programming model proposed by Liu et al. (2012) is also technically incorrect.

This section introduces new transitivity conditions and develops a two-stage goal programming approach to correct the errors in Liu et al. (2012).

                            is consistent.□


                     Theorem 3.2 indicates that if a complete IMPR 
                        
                           A
                           ¯
                        
                      satisfies (2.2), then it is consistent. Conversely, however, if 
                        
                           A
                           ¯
                        
                      is consistent (under Definition 3.1), it does not necessarily satisfy (2.2). Moreover, one can verify that the matrices C and D constructed from 
                        
                           A
                           ¯
                        
                      by using (2.1) depends on alternative labels and are not robust to permutations of decision alternatives. Therefore, it is unreasonable to employ (2.2) to define consistency of complete IMPRs.

As per (1.1), any of the equations of the statements (ii)–(iv) in Theorem 3.1 holds true for IMPRs if two of the indices i, j, k are equal, or the three of them. Let

It is noted that the parameter p controls the tradeoff between the uncertainty level and the consistency of the complemented IMPR. The smaller the p value, the less uncertainty the complemented judgments have. If p = 1, then the complemented interval judgments collapse into single points and have no uncertainty.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This note has shown that the consistency definition and the goal programming model proposed by Liu et al. (2012) are technically wrong. New transitivity conditions have been put forward to correct the errors, and a two-stage goal programming approach with an uncertainty level controlling parameter has been developed to estimate missing values for incomplete IMPRs.
