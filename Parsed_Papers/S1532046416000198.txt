                  Objectives
                  Today, hospitals and other health care-related institutions are accumulating a growing bulk of real world clinical data. Such data offer new possibilities for the generation of disease models for the health economic evaluation. In this article, we propose a new approach to leverage cancer registry data for the development of Markov models. Records of breast cancer patients from a clinical cancer registry were used to construct a real world data driven disease model.
               
               
                  Methods
                  We describe a model generation process which maps database structures to disease state definitions based on medical expert knowledge. Software was programmed in Java to automatically derive a model structure and transition probabilities. We illustrate our method with the reconstruction of a published breast cancer reference model derived primarily from clinical study data. In doing so, we exported longitudinal patient data from a clinical cancer registry covering eight years. The patient cohort (n
                     =892) comprised HER2-positive and HER2-negative women treated with or without Trastuzumab.
               
               
                  Results
                  The models generated with this method for the respective patient cohorts were comparable to the reference model in their structure and treatment effects. However, our computed disease models reflect a more detailed picture of the transition probabilities, especially for disease free survival and recurrence.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Our work presents an approach to extract Markov models semi-automatically using real world data from a clinical cancer registry. Health care decision makers may benefit from more realistic disease models to improve health care-related planning and actions based on their own data.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Breast cancer is the most leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. More than one million patients are diagnosed with breast cancer every year [1]. In the last decades, targeted therapies for HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)-positive cancer were developed to improve the prognosis for these patients. HER2 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in epithelial cells as found in breast tissue. Overexpression of the HER2 protein or amplification on the HER2 gene occurs in about 15–25% of all breast cancer cases [2]. Both indicate aggressive growth and spreading of the tumor. Several health economics evaluations assessed the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in the treatment of HER2-positive women [3–6].

In health economics, disease models (DM) are widely used to conduct evaluations of new treatment plans, medications or prevention programs [7]. Health care facilities use an increasing number of information systems to document the treatment of patients. However, these systems also collect data for “such activities as analysis, research, quality and safety measurement, public health, payment, provider certification or accreditation, marketing, and other business applications, including strictly commercial activities” [8]. This approach is referred to as secondary use of data, i.e., data are re-used in a different context. It is general consensus that such clinical data have “significant potential to facilitate research, improve quality of care for individuals and populations, and reduce healthcare costs” [9]. Before secondary use can tap its full potential issues like data stewardship principles, reduction and elimination of data silos and guaranteed patient privacy must be addressed [9].

Several US [10] and European [11] research initiatives also from scientific societies such as ISPOR (International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research) focus on the usage of “real world data” for comparative effectiveness research and health services research [12,13]. These initiatives demand for real world data to assess the impact of new medical interventions in routine care settings. Especially in disease modeling, an increased usage of real world data could bridge the gap between efficacy and effectiveness, i.e., the relation of cost to (added) value under routine conditions [14].

This article presents a 4-step model generation process (Definition – Selection – Transformation – Generation) to derive a Markov model from a cancer registry in a semi-automatic manner. We illustrate our approach in a validation study by re-constructing a previously published DM by Blank et al. [3] with data from routine care.

We demonstrate how inclusion and exclusion criteria from the randomized Herceptin Adjuvant Trial (HERA) are used to select a suitable cohort of patients [15]. Moreover, definitions of disease states are mapped to database tables from a tumor documentation system. To assess differences between the results obtained from real world data and data collected under optimal conditions of a randomized clinical trial (RCT), transition probabilities of the computed model are compared with probabilities derived from a breast cancer RCT.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

In general, the structure of a Markov DM consists of disease states and transitions. Typically, the probabilities of these transitions should be derived from the most representative data sources, e.g., population-based epidemiological studies, systematic-reviews, or meta-analyses. If none of the above are available, RCTs are being used regularly [16].

A DM based on patient records captured in a large clinical database instead of RCTs could improve DMs to better reflect the clinical reality. That means the efficacy of interventions can be confirmed with data from clinical routine conditions [17]. Health care decision makers could improve the development and allocation of measures to the health care system based on more realistic forecasts [12]. As a consequence, hospitals and disease registries should not use their data for the single purpose of patient care but to “dig for hidden gold” and “uncover the treasures buried in hospital medical records” [18]. This could lead to continuous improvement in health and health care what is commonly referred to as “the learning health system” [19]. The approach presented in this work supports this paradigm as it makes use of a real world, health care data collection.

In health economics, the most common model types are decision trees and Markov models [20]. Our study concentrates not on decision trees but on Markov models because these can handle more complex and time-depending scenarios. The structure of a Markov model consists of S
                     ={s
                     1,
                     s
                     2,…,
                     sn
                     } disease states and a maximum of n
                     2 transitions between them. States are specified as mutually exclusive, i.e., every patient is only allocated to clearly distinctive disease conditions (“no overlaps”). Moreover, the states are collectively exhaustive, i.e., the complete disease history is illustrated in the model structure (“no gaps”). While passing through the model every patient can be allocated to only one particular disease state at any given point in time. In health economic modeling every state is assigned with specific costs and utility values, e.g., quality of life. Cohort simulations are performed to capture all costs and utilities for a cohort of patients which is distributed across all the states during the desired time horizon H 
                     [16]. While passing through the different states of the DM the cohort collects costs and utilities. These values can be summed up for further analysis, e.g., cost-effectiveness evaluation.

The clinical cancer registry of the Cancer Center (CC) Heilbronn-Franken is operated by the SLK-Hospital Holding, located in southern Germany. Its enrollment population amounts to about 1 million people. In the region of Heilbronn-Franken, the SLK-Hospital Holding is the largest hospital owner. This implies that most cancer cases in the administrative district are treated there [21].

Documentation in the CC started in 1986. Today, the database comprises about 60,000 cases. Since 2001, the Giessen Tumor Documentation System (GTDS) [22] is used in the CC. GTDS was developed with funding support by the Federal Ministry of Health of Germany in the early 1990s. It is used in about 60 cancer registries and is updated regularly to meet new standards and requirements [23]. GTDS is managed via a graphical user interface which is used in daily routine at the CC or for simple analyses. For more complex reports or record exports, a command-line interface is available. Both ambulatory and stationary follow-up assignments are recorded in the GTDS-system.

We defined a process to generate a Markov model what we refer to as ‘semi-automatically’, see Fig. 1
                        . In this context, semi-automatically means that the selection of meaningful clinical parameters is done manually, see Step 1. All other steps in the generation process are performed automatically, e.g., generation of database queries or probability calculations. A detailed description of the process is given in the subsequent sections The model generation software was developed in Java to support the process and to visualize the results.

At first, the disease states of the Markov model have to be defined. This is based on physiological knowledge about the disease, its progression and best practices. In order to use a database for the generation of a Markov model structure, the medical definition of a state hast to be mapped to database columns and their specific values. An example for such a mapping can be found in Table 2.

It is mandatory to confer with physicians, documentation officers, study nurses, etc., to obtain the best mapping between medical state description and database structure.

The result of Step 1, i.e., the previously defined disease state mapping, is used to automatically generate SQL (Structured Query Language) statements to query the related dataset. Each disease state is reflected in one specific SQL statement. If a patient is selected by a query, the related patient record applies to the associated disease state. Only those selected patients are considered in Step 3 and Step 4. Patients can be matched to [1…n] states, which reflect the progression of the disease over time. For example, if a patient is declared as disease free, he/she may have a relapse and may die after another five years. This procedure would then yield three matching disease states (Disease free – Recurrence – Death) for this particular patient.

Selected patients from Step 2 and their associated [1…n] disease states are sorted by the date of the observation. This way, a sequence of events is derived for every patient. Usually these events are scattered over the entire time horizon H of the model leading to “time gaps” between the events. The algorithm fills such time gaps using the last observation carried forward method (LOCF), see Fig. 2
                           .

At the end of Step 3, every patient has a complete disease state sequence which spans H, as previously defined for that particular data analysis.

A model structure consists of S states and n
                           2 transitions. A change of a state in the patient’s sequence indicates such a transition. Patients’ shifts between states can be denoted as a transition count matrix

                           Based on the data of Step 3, the detected transitions determine a model structure which contains health states and transitions between them.

Our software allows the export of the suggested model structure in a spreadsheet file format. We chose this file format as it supports further parametrization of a DM without restriction to a dedicated simulation and modeling software like TreeAge or Arena. In addition, spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel are considered capable enough for all aspects of Markov model generation and result presentation [20].

Further allocation of parameters such as costs and utilities or the optimization and fitting of transition probabilities could be necessary if a model should be used in a health economic evaluation.

We rely on the Markov model for breast cancer relapse and survival which was published by Blank et al. [3] as a reference for our validation study, see Section 4. We chose it because it reflects a European healthcare setting and uses data from the important and well accepted European HERA trial [15].

HERA was an international, intergroup, open-label, phase III randomized trial involving women with HER2-positive early-stage invasive breast cancer. One study group in HERA was treated with Trastuzumab for two years. Another group only received Trastuzumab for one year. HERA showed that women with HER2-positive breast cancer can benefit from Trastuzumab. The rate of recurrence, particularly distant recurrence, was reduced by approximately 50%. However, it increases treatment costs drastically. In 2006, Trastuzumab was approved for adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients. In 2008, the updated version of the German clinical guideline for breast cancer recommended the usage of Trastuzumab [25].

The structure of the model by Blank et al. is similar to other health economic evaluations regarding breast cancer and its recurrence [6]. Other DMs, for example Braun et al. [26] or Bos et al. [27], use additional information on menopausal status and nutrition. However, such parameters are not documented in our clinical dataset and therefore those DMs are not suitable for comparison in our setting.

The DM by Blank et al. defines disease states as Disease free, Local recurrence, Regional recurrence, Metastasis, and Death with possible transitions between these states as illustrated in Fig. 3
                        .

Blank et al. uses the data from the HERA-trial [15] to model disease-free survival of HER2-positive/-negative patients. Probabilities for recurrences were derived from published retrospective reviews of medical records and not dependent on HER2-status [28,29]. Survival rates for metastatic breast cancer patients originate from two phase III trials [30,31]. The authors assume that after five years, the risk of reappearing metastasis would decline by 10% annually [32]. They create a life-long Markov model with a time horizon of H
                        =50 years and a cycle length of ct
                        
                        =1 year.

The data protection officer of the SLK-Hospital Holding was involved in the early phase of our study to ensure compliance to German privacy legislation. Furthermore, the project was evaluated and approved beforehand by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Heidelberg.

A de-identified copy of the GTDS system was created and provided by the CC. In 2004, the CC was certified as specialized center for breast cancer by the German Cancer Society. An almost complete and valid documentation of patient records can be assumed since this year. Relapses often occur one to two years after initial primary treatment. Therefore, we only considered female breast cancer patients which were diagnosed from 01-01-2004 to 31-12-2012 (n
                        =3230) as patients diagnosed in the subsequent years might not have developed a relapse yet. Accordingly, the time horizon of our model study was set to H
                        =8 years.

Records were checked for duplicates or implausible entries, e.g., date of death prior to date of being disease free. Entries for TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors (TNM) and grading of tumors were cleaned to ensure comparability. For instance, in some cases grading was documented as ‘G2’ instead of ‘2’, TNM-stages were reduced to the major groups ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’ and ‘4’ instead of ‘1a’ for example.

We identified and applied mutual inclusion criteria as shown in Fig. 4
                         compatible to our clinical reference study [15]. A main issue was the correct identification of HER2-positive women. As cut-off for HER2-positivity we chose values of ‘2’ and ‘3’ in the recorded results of immunohistochemistry (IHC) examinations.

According to the German clinical guideline for breast cancer, HER2-positive patients can be treated with either Trastuzumab (trade name: Herceptin) or Lapatinib (trade name: Tykerb/Tyverb) [25]. Patients which received such a treatment were identified via a search for systemic therapy protocols that contained the terms ‘Trastuzumab’, ‘Herceptin’ or ‘Lapatinib’. The query results showed that Lapatinib-treatment was documented for only one patient. The related record was not considered for further analysis as it is not relevant for the generation of a Trastuzumab-related DM.

In total, four separate patient cohorts were identified from the remaining records (n
                        =892):
                           
                              C-1. Patients with positive HER2 status and no Trastuzumab treatment (n
                                 =145)

C-2. Patients with positive HER2 status and with Trastuzumab treatment (n
                                 =138)

C-3. Patients with negative HER2 status and no Trastuzumab treatment (n
                                 =606)

C-4. Patients with negative HER2 status and with Trastuzumab treatment (n
                                 =3)

As the modeling study of Blank et al. [3] created a DM for every cohort, we first intended to compare the related structure and transition probabilities with the cohorts as found in our data. However, cohort C-4 needed to be excluded, since from a clinical point of view it is not appropriate to treat HER2-negative patients with Trastuzumab. We assume that there are either misclassifications or documentation errors in these three records. Unfortunately, we could not further investigate on these issues as we had no access to the original records and/or hospital-wide information system.

A first patient characteristics analysis of the cohorts C-1 to C-3 revealed that there were differences with respect to the distribution of age, tumor sizes, hormone receptor status, etc. Therefore, we balanced cohorts C-1 to C-3 with the propensity score matching method [33]. For this step, we used the MatchIt-package for the statistical software R which implements the nearest neighbor method [34]. Cohort C-2 served as reference population for the matching process.

Some of the HERA-trial baseline characteristics were not documented at all in the GTDS-system, e.g., race of the patients, menopausal status. Thus, not every variable could be considered and we only used a subset (6 out of 13) of the HERA baseline characteristics, see Table 1
                        .

Information on the other seven criteria is provided as additional Supplementary material in Appendix A.

Based on the model developed by Blank et al., we tried to map the given description for every disease state to columns documented in the GTDS dataset. A closer examination of the dataset revealed that no differentiation between local and regional recurrence was made for most records. Therefore, only one state of Recurrence instead of two states (Local recurrence and Regional recurrence) exists.

Patients do not transit to the state Disease free once a recurrence or metastasis has occurred. In our model structure, every disease state is associated to only one specific calendar date. As a consequence, we introduced separate remission-states to allow patients to recover from their recurrence or metastases. The adapted model structure is depicted in Fig. 5
                        . A detailed description of the final mapping between disease states and columns in GTDS is described in Table 2
                        .

The generated DM’s structure and its transitions probabilities depend on the underlying real-world dataset. We generated the model under the following assumptions:

HER2-positivity is assumed if the result of the IHC test is reported as ‘2’ or ‘3’. Patients with an intermediate score of ‘2’ are often additionally tested with Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) to confirm their HER2-status. However, and in accordance to the model developed by Blank et al. [3] we choose IHC testing only.

A clear differentiation between a recurrence and a metastatic relapse can be made and can be detected in the dataset.

Relapses or deaths do not take place within twelve months after the initial tumor treatment. Therefore, we define a cycle length of one year, i.e., ct
                        
                        =1

Trastuzumab treatment is conducted in accordance to good clinical practice. If a Trastuzumab treatment is detected in the related patient entry, the treatment procedure is considered to be successfully completed and that no side effects or adverse events occurred.

For a statistical comparison between the cohorts, we decided to compare cohort C-1 to C-2, i.e., treatment with/without Trastuzumab for HER2-positive women. After 8years we counted the number of patients still being disease free, having a relapse or metastases. We performed the exact binomial test with the proportions of cohort C-1 as the probability of success. Proportions of C-2 for being disease free after 8years were expected to be greater than in C-1. Proportions for a relapse were expected to be less than in C-1 (one-sided test, alpha error 0.05).

@&#RESULTS@&#

To obtain real world driven DMs for our setting, we derived the structure and the transition probabilities according to the process, defined in Section 3. As outlined in Section 4.1 three models – each for every patient cohort – were generated.

The common structure of each model is illustrated in Fig. 5. The disease states are Disease free, Recurrence, Remission recurrence, Metastasis, Remission metastasis, and Death. At cycle c
                     0, virtually all women are assumed to be Disease free.

Afterwards patients may progress to the states Recurrence, Metastasis or Death. As depicted, patients do not transit into the state Disease free after a recurrence.

Our findings confirm the positive effect of Trastuzumab treatment in HER2-positive women in routine care. The probabilities to remain Disease free are significantly higher (p
                     =0.04) in that cohort compared to HER2-positive women who were not treated with Trastuzumab, and the probabilities for a relapse are smaller for patients in that cohort too, see Table 3
                     .

We found that in the C-2 cohort 97.8% of the patients are still alive after 24months, in comparison to 95.7% in the C-1 cohort. In the HERA-study 96% (Trastuzumab-arm) and 95.1% (observation arm) were still alive after 24months, respectively. In the model’s C-2 cohort, 93.8% of the patient survived free of disease after 24months (85.8% in HERA). In the C-1 cohort, 86.0% survived disease free (77.4% in HERA).

In this article we presented an approach to generate DMs based on routine care data documented in a clinical cancer registry. The semi-automatic generation of such DMs is shown as feasible and the generated results are comparable to a reference model.

Similar to our approach work by Abler et al. describes a disease modeling process [36]. They present a “data-driven Markov model” in the evaluation of adverse events in a radiotherapy setting. In their approach, they first create a meta-language to describe health states and their transitions. Next, a generated template is used to derive Markov models from distinct data sources. Finally, they demonstrate their method with an artificially generated toxicity dataset.

Another investigation in this field was conducted by Lange et al. [37]. In their work, they developed a “joint model” of a discretely observed “multistate disease process” and a random observation time process. For illustration purposes, they apply this model to a secondary breast cancer event study. Thereby, they utilize mammography and biopsy records from a sample of female primary breast cancer patients. As a result, prevalence information of undetected secondary breast cancer events is computed via the generated model.

In comparison to these two approaches, real world data is also increasingly used in modeling and health services research: Erenay et al. [38] used a clinical database to analyze 284 patients with colorectal cancer. They calibrated a discrete event simulation with real world clinical data manually extracted from a free text surgery-centric database. Their simulation outcomes supported the understanding of progression and characteristics of metachronous colorectal cancer.

The authors of [39] estimated transition probabilities for kidney disease with Hidden Markov Models trained on data from a state-wide health care provider in the USA. The patient cohort comprised about 60,000 cases and allowed for insights in the progression of chronic kidney disease states.

Health care data is also frequently used in the field of predictive modeling: For instance prediction of outcomes of pneumonia patients [40], finding associations between medication, laboratory result and patients’ problem lists [41] or providing decision support in pediatrics [42].

In this context, national standardization and initiatives could be a way to enable more researchers to work with real world clinical data. In the US, the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) utilized several heterogeneous data sources to combine them via a common data model in order to monitor medical products safety [43]. However, common data models in the US have not been widely adopted either. OMOP (and most other models) tend to be utilized only for specific, time-limited, grant-funded research networks.

Even though data on cancer is documented in registries since 1920 in Germany [44], no general consensus between health care providers, institutions and different federal state laws [45] in terms of harmonized data models and crosslinks between data sources exists [23]. As a consequence, it is difficult to apply such a common data model to this “uncoordinated patchwork” and Germany’s “unique structural problems” [45].

In general, our work contributes to all those approaches that leverage routine care data for model generation and calibration. But there are two aspects in which our work is different: Authors of [38,39] used routine care data to gain insights in a partially unknown disease process. Such insights could be used for the calibration of predictive models later. Compared to these approaches, we intend to use the generated models’ structures and transition probabilities for another field of usage: Health services research and health economics. For that reason we also applied a methodology (Markov Models) which is widely known in that field of research [20].

Moreover, we used data directly taken from a tumor documentation database, i.e., it does not originate from a generated dataset or idealized study setting (compared to [36,37]). In contrast to [38], our approach relies directly on an established and well documented system – the GTDS – which is compliant with national cancer data set regulations in Germany. Therefore, our system can leverage newly documented tumor cases via a quick database synchronization with the underlying documentation system. This reduces the burden of manual free text extraction and allows for rapid model recomputation.

Despite using real world data, our validation phase’s results could confirm the positive effects of Trastuzumab in treating breast cancer. This is in accordance to findings by Benson and Hartz [46] who could show in a meta-analysis of 136 reports that treatment effects of observational studies compared to RCTs are not “consistently larger or qualitatively different”. Furthermore, this work is the first contribution of clinical cancer registry data utilization for Markov model generation based on a GTDS data source in Germany.

Population-based cancer registries collect data on all new cases observed in a well-defined population, e.g., a federal state. Such data sources are essential for epidemiology research and public health in general. In contrast, clinical cancer registries document treatment-related information on cancer patients, including, e.g., surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy data. Clinical cancer registries are often hospital- or institution-based. Their records are mainly used for administrative purposes and providing data for population-based cancer registries [47]. Because of the holistic and more extensive documentation of treatment processes and interdisciplinary data, clinical cancer registries like the CC Heilbronn-Franken are an adequate basis for studies in the field of health services research [48].

Usage of data from routine care poses new limitations and pitfalls in terms of data quality. We found that local documentation practice does not always clearly differentiate between metastases and local/regional recurrences in the records. For this reason, the probabilities to get a metastasis might be underestimated, whereas the recurrence probability might be slightly overestimated.

Follow-up care of breast cancer patients is triggered by symptoms [25]. There is no strict follow-up scheme in the German treatment guidelines as it is found for example in the treatment guidance for colon cancer that binds patients to their initial treatment hospital. Therefore, some relapse events might not be captured in our dataset because they were not treated by SLK. We had no information whatsoever to quantify this bias.

Legal privacy restrictions prevented a source data verification [49] and comparison of the documented data with the potential drop-out records in our de-identified database. Hence, such documentation faults could not be resolved. This obstacle affected only five patient records and can be considered negligible.

Not each baseline characteristic of the patient cohorts defined in [15] could be used to balance our cohorts. This limitation originates from the fact that some variables in our records were not documented at all, e.g., ethnicity of the patients. Some others were only available as semi-structured free text, e.g., dosing information of adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, we assumed that all patients with at least one Trastuzumab data entry were treated according to best practice and no adverse events or interruption had occurred. However, these assumptions might increase the number of women who received Trastuzumab in the model. Therefore one could expect false high rates for survival and disease free time periods. In fact, our model reports higher survival rates (max. 2%) and higher disease free proportions (max. 8%) compared to the HERA results. We were not able to quantify the effect of treatment quality or guideline adherence. This aspect might be considered in future research when more detailed and structured patient data should be available.

Sparse data is a crucial limitation for our approach. If small patient cohorts are leveraged as a basis for probability calculations, the calculated outputs could be biased. Access to additional GTDS tumor documentation systems from other clinical cancer registries could increase the sample size and generate more precise models. This particular aspect is of importance to real world data driven DM as patient cohorts in RCTs are typically less diverse with regard to age, quality of life and comorbidities than in the health care system. RCT driven DM need smaller sample sizes to demonstrate significantly different outcomes.

By principle, regional data make ‘regional models’. Other regional data might reflect different medical treatment procedures. In order to raise the representativeness of models derived by our methodology one would like to pool comparative data from multiple cancer centers. In our study such additional databases were not available. Therefore the representativeness of our modeling results remains open. However, regional models allows for regional clinical profiles which could give physicians information about their respective treatment patterns and compare them with those of other physicians, wards, hospitals, etc. [50].

Pre-processing and validation of cancer records are laborious and challenging tasks before the data can be used for the computation of a DM. Typical documentation errors made in a particular institution which might differ from errors in other institutions are unknown. Therefore, the plausibility of patient data can only be judged if knowledge on the local documentation process is available and pre-studies are conducted. However, we previously investigated together with the SLK documentation team on the data quality of the breast cancer records in the CC in terms of completeness, correctness, timeliness and validity. Our independently published results show that the data quality is predominantly good in terms of completeness and correctness [51].

Due to the working routines in the CC cancer patients’ records are not automatically transferred from the hospital-wide information system into the GTDS. In fact, this step is mostly done manually by medical documentation specialists. This could pose an error source of its own.

There are some differences between our generated DM and the Blank et al. model [3] in terms of structure and probabilities: In our model, patients can shift to the state Death at any time. This is in contrast to the literature model where patients only shift to the Death-state if they were previously associated to the Metastasis-state. Most of the annual transition probabilities in the other model remain stable throughout the whole time horizon of H
                        =50 years, whereas the probabilities in our model change every year. This is due to the computation process of the transition probabilities which depends on φij
                         from the maximum likelihood estimator, see Eq. (2) as φij
                         changes depending on the disease state and cycle ct
                        . Table 3 shows the differences between the probabilities published by Blank et al. compared to our calculated transition probabilities. Larger differences were observed in particular for the probabilities for a metastatic relapse.

The probabilities of remaining Disease free or suffering from a Recurrence computed with our DM are gradually declining in contrast to remaining stable as in the model by Blank et al. There is general consensus that the risk of recurrence is higher in the first two years after initial treatment of the primary tumor and declines afterwards [52]. Therefore, our DM seems to provide more realistic transition probabilities.

The estimated transition probabilities in our DM were not age-dependent because the whole patient cohort was used for the generation process. Most decision models are based on age-dependent transition probabilities, though. Our proposed process is able to calculate age-dependent transition probabilities given the data source is big enough. Patient cohorts could be split into desired age groups. The generation algorithm could then be performed with this sub-cohort. However, sub-cohorts may be too small in terms of sample size to achieve reliable results.

An integration of other clinical data sources such as billing information, secondary diseases, and length of hospital stays could provide additional insight to the added values of therapies. Cost data were completely disregarded in this modeling study due to privacy reasons which restricted access to accounting data of the SLK hospital information system. The GTDS-system documents only treatment-related data. However, our software allows the export of results to a spreadsheet software. One could then manually allocate costs and utility values to the proposed health states. Furthermore, optimization and fitting of the calculated probabilities could be performed. This way, additional data sources could be considered in the computed results like overall mortality obtained from national registries or data from RCTs if certain aspects are not covered in the locally documented data. Nevertheless, adequate preparation and inclusion of heterogeneous information like RCT, expert option, etc., into one particular model structure is cumbersome and may post a source of bias, see e.g., [53].

A further development of our model generation algorithm includes the usage of cluster analysis techniques to identify meaningful medical parameter combinations [54]. Such combinations could identify previously unknown disease states. Thus, new models might be found without relying on existing literature and cost-intensive studies. This approach would then represent a ‘fully automatic’ method.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this article, we outlined a feasible approach to generate Markov based DMs on real world data of a regional clinical cancer registry. A generic process for such a model generation is presented. To evaluate the formal correctness, it was compared to a published Markov DM by Blank et al. [3]. Our generated DM’s structure was similar to the one described there. Comparable transition probabilities were computed for disease free survival. In terms of recurrence and metastasis remission probabilities, our DM differs from the model used for comparison as discussed in Section 6. However, the results from our validation study confirm the expected positive effect of Trastuzumab treatment in HER2-positive women for a routine care setting in Germany.
