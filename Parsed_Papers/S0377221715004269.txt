                  We investigate the impact of advance notice of product returns on the performance of a decentralised closed loop supply chain. The market demands and the product returns are stochastic and are correlated with each other. The returned products are converted into “as-good-as-new” products and used, together with new products, to satisfy the market demand. The remanufacturing process takes time and is subject to a random yield. We investigate the benefit of the manufacturer obtaining advance notice of product returns from the remanufacturer. We demonstrate that lead times, random yields and the parameters describing the returns play a significant role in the benefit of the advance notice scheme. Our mathematical results offer insights into the benefits of lead time reduction and the adoption of information sharing schemes.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Due to growing concerns with environmental issues, collection and recycling systems for post-consumer products have been developed in many countries. Return rates for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, for example, are increasing year by year in many countries. The 2012 rates in Europe, Japan and the USA are 52 percent (Petcore, 2013), 90.4 percent (CPBR, 2014) and 30.8 percent (Napcore, 2013), respectively. At the same time, many companies have been developing new remanufacturing processes. Suntory, one of the largest food and beverage companies in Japan, has developed bottle-to-bottle mechanical recycling technology that enables the company to produce PET bottles solely from reused resin (Suntory, 2013).

This world-wide environmental movement is mainly driven by the sustainability ethic (Welle, 2011), but the impact of the recycling system on the dynamics of the supply chain is not well understood.


                     Akçalı and Çetinkaya (2011) argue closed loop supply chains (CLSCs) are generally acknowledged to be more complex than traditional supply chains due to a number of factors: Both the demands and the product returns must be forecasted and incorporated into replenishment decisions. The demand and return may be correlated to each other. Two different lead times are present, the manufacturing lead time and the remanufacturing lead time. In many practical situations, the returned products will also be variable in quality, resulting in a remanufacturing process with a random yield.

It is often advocated that to improve supply chain performance, information should be shared between players. The value of such information sharing in traditional supply chains is well recognized (see Gavirneni, Kapuscinski & Tayur, 1999; Lee, So & Tang, 2000). However, there is little research that addresses information sharing in CLSCs.

This research investigates the impact of the remanufacturer providing advance notice of the product returns on the performance of the manufacturer in a decentralised CLSC. We focus on the stochastic and dynamic performance of the supply chain. The lead times, the degree of correlation between the demand and the product returns, and the random yield of the remanufacturing process are all incorporated into a mathematical model to investigate the benefit of advance notice via a variance analysis. With a constant lead time, the returns are converted into “as-good-as-new” products that are used alongside newly manufactured items to satisfy market demand. To cope with the uncertainty in demand and returns the manufacturer must forecast them both. However, the returns are already known to the external remanufacturer and this information could be shared in an advance notice scheme. We demonstrate that both the remanufacturing and the manufacturing lead times, the remanufacturing yield, the parameters of the return process, and the advanced notice scheme can have a significant impact on the manufacturer's performance.
                  

As we progressed through our study we became aware that certain knowledge from our understanding of traditional supply chains does not hold true for CLSC. For example, the rule-of-thumb that “reducing lead time improves the dynamic performance of a traditional supply chain” does not always hold true in our CLSC. We were also surprised to learn that higher returns can sometimes reduce supply chain performance.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review. Section 3 defines our CLSC model. Section 4 deduces managerial properties from an analysis of the production quantities and inventory levels. Section 5 presents insights from a numerical exploration. Section 6 concludes. Some proofs are provided in the appendices, and summarises some numerical experiments for verification.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Using some approximations when necessary, Ketzenberg, van der Laan and Teunter (2006) presented two analytical models for quantifying the value of information in the CLSC: a one-period model and a multi-period model. Information on the market demand, the returns and the remanufacturing yield was shared and its impact investigated. Assuming a capacitated CLSC, Ketzenberg (2009) investigated the value of sharing demand, returns, yields and capacity utilization information. Costs were quantified using a simulation study. It was shown that information regarding capacity utilization leads to the largest average benefit, though no type of information is dominant.


                     De Brito and van der Laan (2009) investigated the impact of imperfect information on the forecast of lead time demand in a remanufacturing setting. Inventory cost was used to quantify the consequences of imperfect information. Based on an analysis of four different forecasting methods, they concluded that the most informed forecasting method does not always result in the least cost. Flapper, Gayon and Vercraene (2012) considered imperfect advance return information and inventory cost using a Markov decision formulation. A random return lead time was assumed in a model with finite capacity but no correlation existed between demand and returns. They concluded that advance return information can reduce inventory cost by up to 5 percent, and this was affected by the expected return lead time.

The importance of considering delays in a system is well recognized (Forrester, 1961). Flapper et al. (2012) and Ferrer and Ketzenberg (2004) suggested that it might be reasonable to assume that lead times affect the value of information sharing. Assuming that both lead times were stochastic, van der Laan, Salomon and Dekker (1999) numerically investigated the impact of lead times. Poisson distributions were used to represent demand and return processes. It was found that a longer remanufacturing lead time resulted in a cost reduction, though longer manufacturing lead times always resulted in a cost increase. Inderfurth and van der Laan (2001) also supported this finding. Despite this theoretical support, Guide (2000) found that 60 percent of remanufacturing executives were under pressure to reduce remanufacturing lead times.

It is widely recognised, that demand and product returns are correlated with each other (Akçalı & Çetinkaya, 2011). This correlation assumption is intuitively understandable, as part of the demand eventually becomes the input into the remanufacturing process (Akçalı & Çetinkaya, 2011). van der Laan, Salomon, Dekker and van Wassenhove (1999) and Ketzenberg et al. (2006) modelled correlation between demand and the product returns with product returns that were a random function of the demand. Mitra (2012) assumed that product returns were a fraction of the demand plus a random term.

Practically it is common to have a random yield in the remanufacturing process as the quality of the return products is understandably varied (Guide, 2000). Ferrer and Ketzenberg (2004), Ketzenberg et al. (2006) and Ketzenberg (2009) used a Bernoulli process to represent a remanufacturing process with random yields. Yano and Lee (1995) suggested that one advantage of using the Bernoulli process was its simplicity, but this approach forbids the specification of yield variability. Akçalı and Çetinkaya (2011) suggested that only a few studies incorporate a random yield assumption. This rarity is probably due to the analytical complexity introduced by this feature.

Our research considers the impact of the value of advance notice on the dynamic and stochastic performance of a decentralised CLSC. The demand and the returns are stochastic and cross-correlated. In our model, the lead times of the manufacturer and the remanufacturer and the random yields in the remanufacturing process are considered. We characterize the variances of the serviceable products, the net stock levels and the production orders without specifying their probability distribution functions (PDFs). To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies that simultaneously consider the value of information, the impact of lead times and the random yield in a CLSC setting with correlated demands and returns in such a way. Interested readers can find a comprehensive review of recent CLSC literature in Akçalı and Çetinkaya (2011) and Govindan, Soleimani and Kannan (2015).


                     Fig. 1 shows a schematic of our decentralised CLSC model. It is a periodic review system where both the manufacturer and the remanufacturer employ the same review period. The manufacturer uses an order-up-to policy (Hosoda & Disney, 2006) to determine its production quantity. Both the manufacturing and the remanufacturing processes have unlimited capacity. We assume that there is no difference between remanufactured and new products in terms of quality. This assumption may not be as restrictive as it first seems. For example, Suntory (2013) makes bottles made from both recycled PET resin and petroleum-based resources for the same soft drink product and the customer is not aware of any difference. A push policy is assumed to operate at the remanufacturer. Once returns are available, the remanufacturing process starts immediately and the remanufactured products are subsequently shipped to the manufacturer without delay. The push policy is appropriate in our decentralised setting and fits well with the ethics of sustainability and common industrial practice.

The random yield is modelled using a stochastically proportional yield model (Henig & Gerchak, 1990). This model is appropriate when the system is subject to material variations (Yano & Lee, 1995), and it has previously been used in a remanufacturing study by Tao, Zhou and Tang (2012). The yield is identified at the beginning of the remanufacturing process in what is generally called a “triage” process.

It is assumed that both the market demands (Dt
                        ) and the product returns (Rt
                        ) are white noise processes. This white noise assumption is widely used in much of the CLSC literature (e.g. Ketzenberg et al., 2006; Ketzenberg, 2009). The means of Dt

                         are μD

                         and Rt
                         becomes θ, see Appendix A. It should be noted that we do not model the correlation between the “satisfied demand” and the returns. Also, there is no correlation between 
                           
                              D

                         and Rt
                         when x is a nonzero integer. This assumption might not be the most general representation but, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first research which explicitly incorporates correlation between demands and returns in the literature. The correlation coefficient, |θ| ≤ 1. If demand and the return are independent of each other we set 
                           
                              θ
                              =
                              0
                           
                        . If larger (smaller) demands eventually results in larger (smaller) returns then there is likely to be a positive correlation between demand and returns, 0 < θ ≤ 1. If a collect-and-return process shares a limited logistics capacity with the delivery of new product to customers there could be negative correlation between demand and returns, 
                           
                              −
                              1
                              
                              ≤
                              
                              θ
                              
                              <
                              
                              0
                           
                        ; as when the requirements for delivering new (returned) products are high there is less logistics capacity available to collect returns (new products).

                         becomes larger than the standard deviation of Dt
                        . It is assumed that μD
                         ≫ μR
                        , as in van der Laan, Salomon, Dekker and van Wassenhove (1999), since practically the product returns are a portion of the demand. This assumption might not hold at the very end of a product life cycle or when a new version/edition of the product is introduced. However, in our Suntory example, as the returned bottles are mechanically destroyed and reformed into a new bottle, this factor is not an issue.

At the beginning of time period t, the remanufacturer observes the total number of units Rt
                         that have been returned from the market place. All of the returns are then pushed into the remanufacturing process. The remanufacturing process is not capacitated but it is subject to a random yield. If the remanufacturer receives Rt
                         at t, the quantity of serviceable goods the remanufacturer actually processes is

                         due to the random yield. It is assumed that the value of Ξ(Rt
                        ) is recognised by the remanufacturer at time t, and the yield distribution does not depend on time t or the quantity of Rt
                        . When Rt
                         is realised, ξt
                         is also identified, as in Ketzenberg (2009). The expected yield

                         is then observed and satisfied from the on-hand inventory. If the manufacturer does not have sufficient on-hand inventory to fill the demand, the unmet demand is backlogged. At the end of period t, the manufacturer places a production order Pt
                         to meet the future demand, taking into account the expected future product return rate. Fig. 2
                         illustrates the sequence of events. Note that the manufacturer makes his production decision after he has received product from the remanufacturer. The manufacturer's net stock level at the end of period t, follows

                        and the target net stock (TNS) level is a time invariant constant predetermined to minimise inventory holding and backlog cost. If the distribution of the inventory is known, the TNS may be identified using standard newsvendor techniques and the inventory costs become linear functions of the standard deviation of the inventory levels, Brown (1963). However, the distribution of the inventory level is difficult to determine due to the non-linear impact of the random yield. This means numerical approaches are required to allocate costs. For this reason we have elected to judge performance based solely on the variance of inventory and capacity levels.

                         depend upon the availability of the advance notice scheme. We have the following two cases in our setting: (1) advance notice is not available (case N) and (2) advance notice is available (case A). Further note that Pt
                         can be negative, indicating that the sum of the on-hand inventory and the pipeline inventory is higher than the target order-up-to level. In such a case, the excess inventory will stay there until being used as part of a future replenishment. This assumption is called the costless return assumption (see Dong & Lee, 2003; Hosoda & Disney, 2009). However, this costless return assumption is not as restrictive as it appears, especially when μD
                         ≫ μR
                        .

                        ) and the yield (ξt

                        ). The expected value

Having defined the replenishment policies, the next section derives expressions for the variance of the production and net stock levels.

The variance expressions shown in this section are obtained without specific assumptions of the distribution of Dt, Rt
                      or ξt
                     . We use V[x] to denote the variance of x.

When no advance notice is given, Pt
                         is given by (9), and its variance is

This is intuitively understandable, as the advance information reduces the uncertainty in the system and the net stock levels can be more tightly controlled. This property means the advance notice scheme allows the manufacturer to reduce his inventory-related costs.

This property shows that the bullwhip behaviour of the CLSC is different to a traditional supply chain where the variance of the production orders is equal to the variance of the demand for the OUT policy under i.i.d. demand and minimum mean squared error forecasting (Lee et al., 2000). This result suggests a CLSC is more likely to experience bullwhip than a traditional supply chain.

This suggests that advance notice of the product returns enables the manufacturer to reduce the bullwhip effect. However, this desirable outcome occurs only in a limited set of circumstances. For example, if Dt
                         and Rt
                         are mutually independent (that is,

                        . This may lead us to the conclusion that the advance notice scheme does not influence the bullwhip effect. When

                         and θ < 0, the variance of the production order increases when information is shared. Therefore, if the reduction of the bullwhip effect is a major concern, we should be careful when using an advance notice scheme. Managers should pay attention to the values of {θ, Tp, Tr, τ}.

If there is flexibility in the choice of values for Tp

                        , longer remanufacturing lead times decrease the inventory variance. In a traditional supply chain, it is known that longer lead times increase net stock variance (Chen, Drezner, Ryan & Simchi-Levi, 2000; Hosoda & Disney, 2006; Lee et al., 2000). Our results indicate that such an insight obtained from a supply chain without returns is not valid in our CLSC. Using a numerical analysis, van der Laan, Salomon, Dekker and van Wassenhove (1999) also found this phenomenon could be observed when Tp
                         > Tr
                        . Inderfurth and van der Laan (2001) reported similar findings to Properties 4 and 5, although the settings and assumptions used in their model were different from ours. We have provided validation of Inderfurth and van der Laan's (2001) lead time paradox by mathematically establishing and characterising its existence, albeit in a very different CLSC.

Interestingly, the lead time paradox can be observed even when the advance notice is not available to the manufacturer. Eq (12) suggests that when

                        Property 6 suggests that when an advanced notice scheme is available a shorter remanufacturing lead time (Tr
                        ) does not decrease the net stock variance when Tr
                         > Tp
                        . Therefore managers should think carefully about investing in capability to reduce Tr
                         as this may not reduce inventory costs. Indeed, as

                                 )

                        , they should focus efforts on reducing Tp
                        . Property 6 occurs because the advance notice scheme allows one to remove all the uncertainties associated with the returns and the remanufacturing process.
                        
                     

Finally, our variance expressions reveal that irrespective of the availability of advance notice, the following two fundamental trade-off issues exist in CLSCs.


                        
                           Property 7

                                          NS
                                       
                                       A
                                    
                                    ]
                                 
                               
                              when Tr
                               ≥ Tp, the production and the net stock variances are increasing in μR
                              .

It is obvious from the variance expressions that when μR
                         increases, V[Ξ(R)] will increase, which could result in lower supply chain performance. Companies should be careful about increasing the average return rate, μR
                        . A similar phenomenon was identified by van der Laan, Salomon, Dekker and van Wassenhove (1999) who concluded that it may be unwise to remanufacture all returned products. These findings suggest that whilst larger values of μR
                         are preferable for the environment, lower values of μR
                         enhance the dynamic performance of the supply chain.

                         only when Tr

                         increases but V[ξ] remains constant, the production and the net stock variances increase. This suggests that a more effective remanufacturing process may lead to lower supply chain performance.


                        Properties 4, 5 and 6, lead to the following managerial insights. To reduce

                        . In addition, as a longer lead time may generate additional costs (for example WIP costs), reducing Tr

                         ≥ Tp

                     . The impact of this uniform distribution assumption on the PDF of the production orders is shown in Appendix C. Through extensive simulation we have observed that the difference between the actual PDF and the normal PDF with a matched mean and variance becomes indistinguishable when the variance of the random yield is small. In this situation an investigation of costs based on newsvendor techniques that exploits only the first and second moments will be quite accurate.

Assume now that the following expression is a good indicator of the value of advance notice on the inventory cost,

                     Fig. 4 illustrates the impact of Tr

                     . The graph on the left-hand side shows that when Tr
                      ≥ Tp
                      (= 5, in this case), 
                        
                           Δ

                      is maximized and independent of Tr
                     . The graph on the right-hand side of Fig. 4 illustrates the impact of μR
                      on 
                        
                           Δ

                     . The value of μR
                      varies from 10 to 90. Fig. 4 shows that 
                        
                           Δ

                      is increasing in μR
                      and is affected by Tr
                     , but 
                        
                           Δ
                           ^
                        
                      becomes less sensitive to μR
                      as μR
                      increases. Overall, Fig. 4 suggests that increasing the remanufacturing lead time Tr
                     , or the mean returns μR
                     , results in higher benefits from the advance notice scheme. Also, the advance notice is most valuable when Tr
                      ≥ Tp
                      and μR
                      is large. Note however that a longer Tr
                      or larger μR
                      may increase other costs, such as WIP or remanufacturing costs which are not captured by our objective function.

                      ≥ Tp
                     , irrespective of τ. This suggests that the manufacturer will obtain a benefit from reducing his lead time Tp
                      to Tr
                     , but not from reducing it further.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Using a mathematical model and a numerical study, we have investigated the benefit of an advance notice scheme and its dependence on lead times, random yield and correlation between demand and returns. We have shown that sharing return and yield information may be beneficial to the manufacturer. In certain scenarios, however, the production variance could increase, although the net stock variance decreases as the result of the advance notice scheme. We found that longer remanufacturing lead times Tr
                      may reduce inventory variance. This is a rediscovery and mathematical validation of the lead time paradox first identified by van der Laan, Salomon, Dekker and van Wassenhove (1999) and then investigated by Inderfurth and van der Laan (2001). Our model considers a somewhat different setting to these previous studies, suggesting that the lead time paradox may be quite common in CLSCs. We have also shown that increasing the returns and the yields could have a negative impact on the system. This might be an interesting topic for future research.

Our findings yield the following general guidelines for managers. Advance notice of returns allows tighter control of inventories, especially when two lead times are equal and both are minimised. CLSCs with advance notice and two identical and minimised lead times not only reduce inventory variance but also can avoid the lead time paradox and the fundamental trade-off between the volume of return and dynamic supply chain performance.

Finally, research limitations should be mentioned. The findings shown in the research may not be applicable to other settings. For example, we considered a decentralised, push system. In a centralised system, an inventory of remanufacturable products at remanufacturer could be held to allow the remanufacturer to exploit a pull policy in order to achieve a more efficient supply chain. This is a different scenario that requires a different model and may result in different findings.

The results from simulating the system for 100,000 periods in Excel are summarised with a frequency plot of the production orders, see Figs. 8 and 9
                     
                     . We have also plotted a normal distribution with the same mean and variance as the relevant system state. Although the first two moments are identical, the PDF is not completely captured. This is because the multiplication of the returns by the remanufacturing yield creates a non-linear system that is very difficult to characterise fully.

The most extreme error in the frequency plot can be seen in the yield (Fig. 8) for the case when a =  {0.1, 0.7} and b = 0.9. This is the source of the non-linearity in the model. When the variance of the yield reduces (when a = 0.7 and b = 0.9 are used for the boundaries of the uniformly distributed yield), the normal approximation becomes more accurate.

The PDF of the orders becomes more normal than the yield PDF, and we can again see that the smaller yield variances induce a better fit to the normal distribution, as shown in Fig. 9.

The inventory PDFs are shown in Fig. 10. The dominant factor determining normality now seems to be whether there is advance notice or not. Advance notice also has a significant impact on reducing the inventory variance. We can also see that when the yield has a reduced variance, then the first and second moments better describe the density of the inventory levels.
