                  In this paper, we introduce triangular subdivision operators which are composed of a refinement operator and several averaging operators, where the refinement operator splits each triangle uniformly into four congruent triangles and in each averaging operation, every vertex will be replaced by a convex combination of itself and its neighboring vertices. These operators form an infinite class of triangular subdivision schemes including Loop's algorithm with a restricted parameter range and the midpoint schemes for triangular meshes. We analyze the smoothness of the resulting subdivision surfaces at their regular and extraordinary points by generalizing an established technique for analyzing midpoint subdivision on quadrilateral meshes. General triangular midpoint subdivision surfaces are smooth at all regular points and they are also smooth at extraordinary points under certain conditions. We show some general triangular subdivision surfaces and compare them with Loop subdivision surfaces.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Subdivision surfaces are valued in computer graphics and CAGD for their convenience and flexibility to represent free-form surfaces of arbitrary topology and for their intimate relation to multiresolution analysis. The papers by Catmull and Clark (1978) and by Doo and Sabin (1978) are the first on subdivision algorithms for arbitrary quadrilateral meshes with extraordinary vertices or faces. Loop's algorithm (Loop, 1987) generalizes the subdivision scheme for three-directional quartic box splines over regular triangular meshes. Stationary subdivision for regular meshes was intensively studied in Micchelli and Prautzsch (1987a, 1987b, 1989), Dyn et al. (1991), Cavaretta et al. (1991), Dyn (1992). The first smoothness analysis of stationary subdivision at extraordinary points was outlined by Sabin in 1978 (Doo and Sabin, 1978), but it took another 15 years until Reif established a rigorous proof (Reif, 1993). Reif's proof is based on an analysis of the subdivision matrix and requires computing or estimating its spectral properties. If done numerically, this approach is limited when it comes to analyzing infinite classes of subdivision schemes (Peters and Reif, 1997, 1998; Umlauf, 2000; Zorin and Schröder, 2001).

The Lane–Riesenfeld subdivision algorithm (Lane and Riesenfeld, 1980) has been developed for rapidly computing cardinal tensor product splines of arbitrary degree and it can be applied only to regular (quadrilateral) meshes. Midpoint subdivision generalizes Lane–Riesenfeld subdivision in so far as it can be applied to arbitrary 2-dimensional manifold meshes. A midpoint subdivision scheme is determined by an operator

Using numerical computations, Zorin and Schröder were able to analyze the midpoint schemes up to degree 9 (Zorin and Schröder, 2001). Only recently, further arguments were developed that helped to show that all midpoint subdivision surfaces of any arbitrarily high degree are

                      everywhere (Prautzsch and Chen, 2011). The results even apply to wave schemes which form a much wider infinite class of subdivision schemes (Chen and Prautzsch, 2013).

In this paper, we further develop the above

                      analysis technique to analyze a class of triangular subdivision schemes that operate on arbitrary 2-dimensional triangular manifold meshes. Although many arguments used in Prautzsch and Chen (2011), Chen and Prautzsch (2013) also apply to the new triangular subdivision schemes, we are challenged by new problems:
                        
                           •
                           In a regular triangular mesh we have three edge directions versus two in regular quadrilateral meshes. Since the edge directions form smaller angles for triangular meshes, we need to adjust our tangent estimates to show regularity and injectivity.

For extraordinary points of valence 3, the regularity and injectivity of the characteristic map cannot be checked as easily as for quadrilateral meshes.

General triangular midpoint subdivision is defined in Section 2 and its

On regular triangular meshes a triangular midpoint subdivision scheme of order n is defined by the operator

                        R
                     , where R is the refinement operator that subdivides all triangles uniformly into four congruent triangles as shown in Fig. 2
                      and

                      is the symmetric averaging operator that is given by a single mask as shown in Fig. 3
                      first introduced in Boehm (1983).

We show that general triangular midpoint subdivision surfaces are

In this section, we consider general triangular midpoint subdivision for arbitrary triangular meshes with extraordinary vertices. We recall some results for wave schemes from Chen and Prautzsch (2013), which are also true for general triangular midpoint subdivision.

Interior vertices of a mesh are called extraordinary if their valence does not equal 6. Subdividing by R and

                      does not increase the number of extraordinary vertices and isolates these vertices. Therefore, it suffices to consider only (sub)meshes with one extraordinary vertex as illustrated in Fig. 6
                     . These meshes are called ringnets.

                      is equivalent to a grid mesh

General triangular midpoint subdivision schemes are introduced and the smoothness of the resulting subdivision surfaces is analyzed. The subdivision surfaces are smooth at all regular points and they are also smooth at extraordinary points under certain conditions.
