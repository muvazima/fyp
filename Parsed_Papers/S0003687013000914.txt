                  A comparison of 14 currently applicable wood harvesting systems was assessed with respect to ergonomic point of view. For this purpose, the research method, based on the Hodges–Lehmann rule and the integrated work-severity rate of single machinery, was developed for ergonomic evaluation of cut-to-length, tree-length and full-tree harvesting systems. Altogether, about 130 different parameters of 36 units of equipment that impact on the ergonomics and work conditions were measured and estimated in interviews undertaken directly at forestry harvesting workplaces in 15 logging companies in the Republic of Karelia, Northwest Russia. Then the results were compared to the effective norms, and the degree of compliance with the stipulated values was determined. The estimates obtained for the degree of compliance were combined. This permits a direct comparison of the workload on forestry harvesting workers such as operators, lumberjacks and choker setters. In many respects, the current ergonomic standard is standard, except for the operators of cable skidders, chainsaws and choker settings. Visibility and work postures were considered to be the most critical features influencing the operator's performance. Problems still exist, despite the extensive development of cabs. The best working conditions in terms of harvesting systems were provided by “harvester + forwarder” in cut-to-length harvesting, and “feller–buncher + grapple skidder” in full-tree harvesting. The motor-manual tree-length harvesting performed with cable skidders showed the worst results in terms of ergonomics.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Full-tree (FT), tree-length (TL) and cut-to-length (CTL) methods, and associated harvesting systems usually are applied in wood harvesting. These methods differ in relation to the technology utilised. The FT method is globally the most common method. FT harvesting means that the trees are felled and the stem, intact with branches, is initially transported to the roadside landing using a skidder. Delimbing and, if necessary, bucking are performed at the roadside. In the TL method, trees are delimbed immediately after felling, and then the intact stems are skidded to the roadside landing. The tree-lengths, in both methods, are then transported by tree-length trucks or trains to the central processing yard or wood-processing mill, where they are bucked into timber assortments. If the bucking is performed at the roadside terminal, the assortments are directly transported by short-wood trucks to the wood-processing mill. The third method, cut-to-length, means that the trees are processed (delimbed and bucked) into timber assortments in conjunction with the felling operations. Then the assortments are extracted with forwarders to the roadside where they are piled to await secondary transport by short-wood trucks to the wood-processing mill.

Each of the harvesting methods also has its specific features that depend on natural and production conditions, the technology used, and the share of manual operations in the overall process. Thus, depending on the level of mechanisation and the type of equipment used, all the identified harvesting systems can be divided into the following most typical groups in Russia (Gerasimov and Seliverstov, 2010):
                        
                           1.
                           Fully mechanised CTL harvesting: felling, processing (delimbing and bucking) with a harvester, and extraction with a forwarder: FM CTL (harvester + forwarder);

Motor-manual CTL harvesting: felling, processing with a chainsaw, and extraction with a forwarder: MM CTL (chainsaw + forwarder);

Motor-manual TL harvesting: felling with a chainsaw, delimbing with a chainsaw/axe, and extraction with a cable skidder: MM TL (chainsaw + skidder);

Fully mechanised FT harvesting: felling with a feller buncher, extraction with a grapple skidder, and processing with a processor: FM FT (feller buncher + skidder + delimber/processor);

Motor-manual FT harvesting: felling with a chainsaw, extraction with a cable skidder, and processing with a delimber: FT (chainsaw + skidder + delimber).

The efficiency and functionality of a particular wood harvesting system depend on a number of characteristics. The economic benefits can be evaluated by such indicators as labour, productivity and cost. Environmental indicators can include soil damage (the rut depth or the degree of soil compaction), damage to undergrowth or remaining trees, etc. The wood quality indicators are determined by evaluating the quality of the timber in accordance with the quality specifications in the customer contracts, as well as other quality requirements. Undoubtedly, work safety and ergonomics cannot be ignored when comparing different technologies. Wood harvesting has been associated with high accident risk due to the low level of mechanisation, especially with a fatal outcome; the latter has been estimated at 1.4 deaths per 1 million m3 cut in Russia (Gerasimov and Karjalainen, 2008). Recently, special attention has been paid to comfortable and safe working conditions in forest operations (Hanse and Winkel, 2008; Smidt, 2011; Synwoldt and Gellerstedt, 2003). This will make harvesting work more attractive to the young, and employment in a logging company more desirable. Ergonomic indicators describing the work severity (noise and vibration levels, visibility, etc.) can be used to evaluate the safety and comfort of the work (Hansson, 1990; Harstella, 1990). Some studies in ergonomics of logging operations have been conducted in Russia during the Soviet time (Byzov, 1985; Oblivin et al., 1988; Vasekin et al., 1991) and are still conducting today in Russia at Voronezh Forest Engineering Academy (e.g., Kondrashova, 2010; Posharnikov et al., 2012), Petrozavodsk State University (e.g., Kukelev and Ustinov, 2005; Sokolov, 2008; Sokolov et al., 2008, 2012; Syunev et al., 2009; Gerasimov et al., 2008) and some others (e.g., Korenevsky et al., 2009).

A positive result of the mechanisation of harvesting work is the drastic reduction in serious accidents and injuries (Axelsson, 1998; Lefort et al., 2003; Potočnik et al., 2009; Sokolov et al., 2008). However, increasing mechanisation is posing new problems. Operators of harvesting machinery are being afflicted by overload injuries to the neck, arms and cervical spine. The main causes of these injuries are probably excessive periods of sitting, excessive work intensity during work in fixed, ergonomically-inappropriate positions, and repetitive, short-cycle movement patterns. Moreover, the motor-manual harvesting systems, using chainsaws, choker settings and primitive cable skidders, still continue to be widely used in forest operations due to steep and wet terrains and the difficult social-economic conditions in many countries, such as Russia. Due to the ergonomic feasibility of harvesting operations being a critical element for the development of wood harvesting, using a number of different harvesting systems, such as MM FT, FM FT, MM CTL, FM CTL and MM TL, the main objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the most applicable currently used harvesting systems in terms of ergonomics.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

There is a need for a comprehensive approach towards the evaluation of ergonomic performance of harvesting operations and the selection of the most appropriate technology for local conditions. To evaluate the efficiency of the harvesting methods currently used, a comprehensive field study (measurements) and personnel surveys (interviews) were performed in Northwest Russia. The region was selected as the study region because its territory is very representative in terms of the wide range of harvesting machinery used and the fact that nearly all harvesting technologies employed in different natural conditions are typical for boreal forests. Harvested forest stands had not been thinned before the final felling. A typical study stand was of mixed tree age and species. The tree species included spruce (31% on average), pine (35%), birch (28%), and aspen (6%). The average stem volumes of the harvesting sites varied between 0.13 m3 and 0.64 m3 under bark with the average value 0.29 m3. The average growing stock of harvested stands was 150 m3/ha with tree density 520 trees/ha. Typical soils in the test areas were loam, clay loam, and sandy loam. The harvesting sites were on flat terrain (Gerasimov et al., 2012; Gerasimov and Seliverstov, 2010).

The study was performed in 2007–2009 and involved 15 logging companies, which harvest 0.866 million m3/yr of wood with CTL, 0.935 million m3/yr with TL, and 0.385 million m3/yr with FT harvesting systems. The companies selected performed harvesting operations, applying all the harvesting systems mentioned using both Russian and foreign machinery. The following machinery was used in the wood harvesting systems studied (Fig. 1
                     ): track feller buncher (Timberjack 850), wheel purpose-built harvester (Timberjack 1270D, John Deere 1070D, John Deere 1270D, Valmet 901.3, Valmet 911.3), excavator-based harvester (Volvo EC210BLC), track cable skidder (TDT-55А, ТLТ-100), track grapple skidder (ML-136), wheel forwarder (Timberjack 1410D, Timberjack 1010D, John Deere 1110D, John Deere 1410D, Valmet 840.3), wheel grapple skidder (Timberjack 460D), and track stroke delimber (LP-30B), chainsaw (Husqvarna 254XP, Husqvarna 262), choker setting. Field research was carried out at 23 harvesting sites, the locations of which are shown in Fig. 2
                     . The study involved field measurements and a personnel survey, with questionnaires for the staff and managers of the logging companies (Fig. 3
                     ).

A common approach was used for the field data collection and processing. Different parameters that impact on the ergonomics and working conditions were directly measured at workplaces under actual working conditions: comfort of the cabin layout and seat, location of controls, operator's body position, etc.; noise and vibration in the cabins and on chainsaw handles; the force needed to operate machine controls, etc. A measuring tape was used to measure a distance, a protractor – angles, a dynamometer – forces, a sound level meter – noise, a vibrometer – vibration, video recording – time. Altogether, about 130 different parameters were measured for 27 machines and 9 chainsaws (Table 1
                        ) according to valid national state ergonomic standards and international and Russian ergonomic guidelines (Frumkin et al., 1999; Gellerstedt et al., 1999; Peskov, 2004).

The measured ergonomic parameters of harvesting machines are resulted in Annex 1. In order to evaluate individual harvesting machines, six ergonomic groups were considered with 2–4 indicators in each group (Table 2
                        ). The measured ergonomic parameters from Annex 1 were participated in forming of ergonomic indicators and groups depending on which factor of the working conditions they were used to evaluate). “Controls” group (total of 56 measured parameters) consisted of four indicators: location and stroke of controls; force required to operate controls; hand-operated controls; foot-operated controls (pedals). “Workplace” group (30 parameters): body position of operator; seat; cabin and seat position in the cabin. “Monotony” group (2 parameters): repetitiveness of the work; complexity of the work. “Visibility” group (5 parameters): visibility angles; visibility in the working direction; visibility in the moving direction; cleanliness of the windshield. “Working environment” group (20 parameters): noise; vibration. “Safety” group (24 parameters): cabin access; parameters other than cabin access such as warning labels.

The measured ergonomic parameters of chainsaws are resulted in Table 3
                        . In order to evaluate chainsaws and choker setting, the single ergonomic group was considered with three indicators (Table 2): noise based on 2 parameters; vibration with 12 parameters and body posture.

The results were then compared with the effective norms and standards, and on the basis of the degree of compliance with the stipulated values the parameters were assessed on a scale of 0–1. An integrated indicator was determined for each group/subgroup of parameters, the level of which enables the evaluation of the comfort of the seat or controls in general, vibration, etc. These indicators were further integrated into one parameter – the so-called work-severity rate (Frumkin et al., 1999):

                        min – minimum value of the integrated indicator; n – number of the integrated indicators. The work severity rate can be valued from 0 to 6. A higher value means a higher severity of conditions of work. This permits direct comparison of working conditions at different workplaces. A higher severity rate represents harder working conditions. Depending on this value, the working conditions were categorised according to as “comfortable”, “relatively uncomfortable”, “extreme” or “super-extreme” according to Table 4
                        . Further documentation for field study methodology per each indicator can be found in Gerasimov and Sokolov (2009).

Measurements enabled the evaluation of some aspects of the working conditions, but not all of them. Some conditions cannot be measured directly, since no reliable measurement methods or appropriate measurement tools are available. For example, it is difficult to measure the aesthetic perfection of the machine or its separate elements. On the other hand, workplaces are occupied by people and each person perceives and evaluates their working conditions from their own perspective. Different people prefer different types of work and working conditions. This also influences a person's choice of a profession, and can lead to a substantial difference between an objective survey of working conditions and subjective evaluations obtained from personnel. Therefore, together with the field measurements, the authors performed opinion surveys among the workers. The surveys were carried out by means of questionnaires. The composition of the estimated factors and their grouping were determined in accordance with the structure of the general ergonomic requirements formulated by Frumkin et al. (1999). Totally 48 factors were assessed. Their composition, grouping, and the results of surveys are shown in Annex 2.

The workers were asked to evaluate their working conditions. Each of the 51 workers interviewed (Table 1) was asked to appraise 48 working conditions on a scale of 1–6. Similar to the field measurements, factors were combined into five groups: “Man-machine interaction” (4 estimated factors); “Engineering perfection of machinery” (15 factors); “Work intensity” (6 factors); “Comfort in the workplace” (8 factors); “Capacity building” (8 factors); “Design of machinery” (7 factors) (Table 5
                        ). The integrated indicator was derived for each group. A work-severity rate at each of the reviewed workplaces was thus determined from the interview data.

The main objective of this study was to compare different wood harvesting systems rather than individual work phases. Each system includes specific types of machines, tools, work operations, etc. It is not difficult to compare two different machines or two different work phases, since it can be carried out by comparing the work-severity rates. The task gets more complex when there is a need to decide which of the two machine systems is better from the ergonomics and safety viewpoints. It becomes necessary to select a principle, which would enable the summarisation of several work-severity rate values into one aggregated value. The Hodges–Lehmann (HL) rule, based on the combination of Wald (W) and Laplace (L) rules, was used to resolve this problem (Eiselt and Sandblom, 2004; Gerasimov and Khlustov, 2001):
                           
                              (2)
                              
                                 
                                    H
                                    L
                                    =
                                    W
                                    +
                                    L
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

According to the Wald's minimax principle (W), the best machine system is the one where the highest work-severity rate from all the work phases in this system is at the lowest level:
                           
                              (3)
                              
                                 W
                                 =
                                 min
                                 
                                 max
                                 
                                 
                                    I
                                    
                                       i
                                       j
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        where, i – index number of the harvesting system; j – index number of the harvesting worker (machine operator, lumberjack, choker setter) in each harvesting system; I
                        
                           ij
                         – integrated work-severity rate for each worker in each system.

In other words, when two harvesting systems are compared, firstly, the work phases with the highest work-severity rate are identified within each system. The machine system where this rate is lower will be considered the best one. If the hardest working conditions in two systems appear to be equal, the second hardest work-severity conditions should be analysed, and so on. This helps avoid over-estimation of such machine systems where some work phases have very good working conditions and some others are very bad. If there is at least one work phase with “extreme” or “super-extreme” working conditions in a machine system or a harvesting method, this system or method can never be considered to be ergonomically perfect.

In contrast to the Wald rule, the Laplace rule (L) takes into consideration each of the possible consequences of all possible solutions:

                                 =
                                 max

                                          i
                                       
                                    
                                 
                                 ∑

                        where n
                        
                           i
                         – total number of harvesting workers in i harvesting system.

Thus, their joint consideration W and L under the umbrella of the Hodges–Lehmann rule makes it easier to avoid some problems with a subjective decision.

Multi-criteria decision making with the Hodges–Lehmann rule is used in many areas of engineering and business activities (e.g., Gerasimov and Khlustov, 1996; Kaklauskas et al., 2007; Zavadskas et al., 2008; Zavadskas and Turskis, 2008; Zavadskas and Ustinovichius, 2003; Das, 2009; Otieno and Anderson-Cook, 2006). Each alternative in multi-criteria decision making problem can be described by a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria, which usually have different units of measurement. The normalization aims at obtaining comparable scales of criteria values. The present paper is focused on introducing this method for decision making normalization for ergonomic evaluation of wood harvesting systems based on combined qualitative and quantitative information about ergonomic indicators of individual machines.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Summarising Fig. 4
                      shows the total work-severity rates for each of the machines. These values average both the objective, measured factors of the operating environment and the subjective perception of the workers on these factors. All three values of the work severity should be taken into account when making a decision to select a certain model of machine. Table 6
                      illustrates the main integrated indicators based on the measurements of studied models of machines. Table 7
                      illustrates the main integrated indicators based on the personnel interviews.

The basis for subdividing of the machines and systems into 3 classes (“comfortable”, “relatively comfortable” and “extreme”) was a category of works. Six categories of workload were highlighted by Frumkin et al. (1999) which cover the full range of possible work-severity rates (I = 0–6). Each category has a comprehensive description of the qualitative and the numeral from I to VI. However, in order to simplify statements and facilitate the understanding the numeral categories of work were transferred to the verbal characteristics of working conditions (e.g., “comfortable”, “relatively comfortable”, “extreme”, “super extreme”).

Five harvester models were studied during the field measurements. Fig. 4 shows the total average work-severity rate for harvesters based on the measured data and personnel survey data, as well as the average values. Thus, for operators of Valmet 901.3 and John Deere 1270D harvesters the working conditions can be considered “comfortable”. For other harvester models, the working conditions can be considered as “relatively uncomfortable”; however, the difference in work-severity rate for all the harvesters analysed was, in fact, insignificant. When reviewing the figures, it is worth noting that the scale of the work-severity rate is opposite to the integrated indicators for measurements and personnel survey, i.e. the higher the rate, the worse the working conditions.

Only one feller buncher model was analysed in the course of the study, specifically the Timberjack 850. This machine proved to be the best in the majority of the indicators evaluated. According to the measurement data, the working conditions of the operator for a Timberjack 850 feller buncher fell into the category of “relatively uncomfortable”, whereas based on the personnel survey, as well as according to the total work-severity rate, they were in the category “comfortable”.

Four forwarder models were analysed in the course of the field study. The Valmet 840.3 forwarder gained lower scores for “Controls” (“location and stroke of controls” indicator) and “Workplace” (“pedals” indicator). This was mainly explained by the fact that, similar to the harvesters of the same brand, the distance between the pedals operated with the same foot and the pedal stroke did not comply with the recommended norms. “Body position” and “seat” indicators were lower because the adjustability of the seat position was at the limits of the recommended range. “Visibility in the moving direction” was substantially higher in a John Deere 1010 forwarder, because it has a much shorter front (a more compact engine room). “Visibility in the operation direction” was somewhat lower in a John Deere 1410D forwarder, mainly due to the overall large dimensions of this machine. Thus, the working conditions of the operator were considered “comfortable” for the Timberjack 1110D forwarder and “relatively uncomfortable” for the rest of the models. Equally, regarding harvesters, the difference in the work-severity rate was not statistically significant.

Later, two models of Russian-made track cable skidders were analysed, the TDT-55A and the TLT-100 manufactured by the Onezhsky Tractor Plant. Thus, the working conditions of the TLT-100 skidder operators can be considered as “relatively uncomfortable”, while in the TDT-55A skidder, they were “extreme”. There was a significant difference between the measurement-based and personnel survey-based severity rates of work. The second one appeared to be significantly lower. Based on the measurement data, the TLT-100 working conditions were “extreme”, and for the TDT-55A they reached “super-extreme”. Naturally, in such conditions only operators who do not perceive conditions as “super-extreme”, thanks to their good adaptation skills, remain in the job. Other operators simply quit the work. This can be seen specifically from the results presented, since for this study, those operators with substantial work experience (over 2 years) with these machines were interviewed.

Only one model of a wheel grapple skidder was specifically analysed, the Timberjack 460D. The main weaknesses of this machine were the following: confined cabin, substantially high noise level and lack of visibility (visibility in the moving direction does not comply at all with the recommendations, because the forward ground visibility was more than 14 m). In addition, high level of repetitiveness should be noted. The operator's working conditions with the Timberjack 460D skidder can be considered “extreme” based on the measurement data, “comfortable” based on the personnel survey data, and “relatively uncomfortable” in general.

Two chainsaw models, Husqvarna 254XP and Husqvarna 262, were analysed. The latter model was only used during felling, while the former was employed for all the work phases analysed. Time parameters of the work cycle were measured, as well as noise and vibration parameters (Table 3).

The weighted average of the acoustic pressure for all types of work was within the norms, provided hearing protectors were used. The allowable continuous vibration can be calculated from the effective vibration acceleration impacting the operator's hands. Having compared the value obtained with the actual measured value, it can be concluded that the Russian standard requirements for vibration safety were not met for any operation, except for bucking in piles.

When felling trees with a Husqvarna 254XP chainsaw, the operator had to spend, on average, 55% of the working time in uncomfortable body positions. This was the highest value in all of the types of job analysed. Uncomfortable positions involved the body tilted forward at great angles; the body weight leaned against half-bent legs, and sometimes head and body having to turned in order to monitor the tree. Since the Husqvarna 262 chainsaw has handles, the time spent in uncomfortable positions resulted in only 14% of the total working time. Uncomfortable positions were not as extreme as in the previous case. The weighted average of the acoustic pressure also turned out to be lower, due to the greater distance between the saw and the operator's ears.

Time spent in uncomfortable positions during delimbing was 31%. The uncomfortable positions involved the body tilted forward at great angles and the body weight leaned against half-bent legs. In many cases, the operator had to stand on one leg only, or on a stem or branches in an unstable position, etc. The weighted average of the acoustic pressure was the highest among all the operations analysed. This was due to the fact that, compared to other work phases, in delimbing, the chainsaw motor is the most frequently running at high RPM levels (66%).

The last type of work, bucking in piles, is seldom used, and it is mainly applied in a combination of TL and CTL harvesting when skidding is carried out in two phases. First, tree-lengths are delivered to the intermediate landing by track skidders. After bucking, the finished assortments are skidded to the upper landing site by forwarders. On the one hand, this operation involved long periods of chainsaw idle time (73%), when the feller was measuring the assortments. On the other hand, it was also typical that during this operation the feller did not use the saw at all for significantly long periods. Usually, the skidder delivered tree-length bunches to the roadside storage more slowly compared to the time required for bucking. Hence, the period of noise and vibration shortened substantially. Therefore, bucking in piles was the only job among the work phases analysed where the standard for continuous vibration was met.

All of the five indicators considered, based on the personnel survey among loggers doing felling, delimbing and bucking, stayed within the range of 3–4 on a 6-point scale. These values further led to a work-severity rate of 3.91, which corresponds to “relatively uncomfortable” working conditions. On the other hand, based on the measured data, none of the work phases conducted with chainsaws, except for bucking in piles, complied with the vibration load standards. Taking into account that the work is performed outdoors all year round in various unfavourable weather conditions, the work-severity rate based on the measurements equalled 6, and the working conditions were considered as “super-extreme”. Thus, the total work-severity rate, based on the two above-mentioned values was 4.96 (“extreme” conditions). This value was later used to compare the different harvesting methods.

The results of the personnel survey among the choker setters, who worked with track cable skidders TDT-55A and TLT-100, are similar to the fellers, except for the engineering perfection of the machine, which was only 1.82 (Table 7). This means that choker setters often considered the machines, as well as the equipment used (cable, choker), as highly imperfect (Fig. 5
                        ). Hence, this affected their subjective evaluation of the work severity. This is why among all the work phases analysed, this job in particular had the highest work-severity rate value of 5.32, which corresponds to “extreme” working conditions.

Fourteen different wood harvesting systems were compared based on the total average work-severity rate obtained for the single harvesting equipment using the Hodges–Lehmann rule (HL). These systems include:
                           
                              •
                              four FM CTL systems with wheel purpose-build harvesters and forwarders (systems 1, 2, 4, 5) and one system with the excavator harvester and wheel forwarder (system 3);

one FM FT system with the track feller buncher, wheel grapple skidders, and track processor (system 6);

one MM CTL system with wheel forwarder (system 7);

two MM FT systems with track cable skidders (systems 8–9);

two MM TL systems with track cable skidders and delimbers (systems 11–12);

combination of MM TL and CTL systems (system 10);

two FT systems as a combination of the overseas feller buncher, Russian cable skidders and delimbers (systems 13–14).

The comparative results for the wood harvesting systems studied are presented in Table 8
                        .

According to the findings presented in this study, FM CTL harvesting performed with the “harvester + forwarder” technology (harvesting system 1–5) and FT harvesting with the “feller buncher + wheeled grapple skidder” (harvesting system 6) appeared to be those that provided the best working conditions. The traditional Russian MM TL harvesting that employs a chainsaw and cable skidders and its various modifications (harvesting systems 8–12) had the worst results in terms of ergonomics, work severity and occupational safety. Thus, when a motor-manual harvesting system is employed, the use of cable skidders should be as limited as possible, because, as a whole, they do not comply with the current ergonomic requirements.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

Similar papers are published in the Nordic countries and Ireland for CTL harvesting (e.g., Synwoldt and Gellerstedt, 2003; Gellerstedt et al., 1999; Grevsten and Sjögren, 1996; Hanse and Winkel, 2008; Harstela, 1990; Sherwin et al., 2004; etc.), in New Zealand, Canada and the USA for FT harvesting (e.g., Bentley et al., 2002; Bentley et al., 2005; Golsse, 1994; Kirk and Sullman, 2001; Murphy and Oliver, 2011; Parker, 2010; Sirois and Smith, 1985; Smidt, 2011; Zerbe, 1979; etc.), also the EU-project ErgoWood (http://www.enfe.net/pberichte_e.htm) and its implementation project COMFOR (http://enfe.net/comforopen/comfor.htm). However, no scientific reports concerning the comparison of ergonomic performance for wood harvesting systems have been found neither in Russia, nor other countries. The research method examined based on the Hodges–Lehmann rule and the integrated work-severity rate of single machinery is perhaps the first attempt to evaluate and compare the ergonomic performance of different wood harvesting systems.

Multi-criteria decision making with the Hodges–Lehmann rule was used in ergonomic evaluation of wood harvesting systems. The method combined qualitative and quantitative information about ergonomic indicators of individual machines. Each alternative in our multi-criteria decision making problem was described by a set of ergonomic indicators and criteria. They are qualitative and quantitative, having different units of measurement and different optimization direction. The normalization of criteria values is needed in this problem with an aim to obtain comparable scales of criteria values. The present research was focused on introducing this method for decision making normalization. The results show an efficiency of the method due to taking into account many different factors, a large number of measurements, as well as a combination of measuring methods with questionnaires. The use of the Hodges–Lehmann rule allows making a comparison of not only individual harvesting machines, but their systems too.

The total work-severity rates for the machines and equipment studied were obtained in a field study and by interviews, and should be improved on in the future due to the study being conducted in only one region in Northwest Russia. Additional ergonomic factors have to be involved in severity rate estimations, such as temperature, humidity, ventilation, and carbon dioxide concentration. When this approach can be used in other climate conditions, for example, tropical forests. Other types and models of applicable machinery, such as chippers, energy wood harvesters, loaders, etc., need to be taken into account due to the number of applicable harvesting systems (over fourteen studied systems appear in this paper) especially with respect to wood-to-energy systems. The results of the measurements obtained at the forestry harvesting works may be helpful in the evaluation of the ergonomic performance of single machinery within the similar harvesting methods and systems in other countries. However, the national or ISO-standards should have to use instead of the Russian national ergonomic standards.

The further method development might be the increasing number of the estimated ergonomic factors. For example, the method should include the full range of the micro-climate factors such as temperature and humidity in different areas of workplace, the content of various contaminants in inhaled air, etc. The measurement of these parameters in the forest is associated with challenges and requires more time and labour, and the special equipment. In addition, these factors are highly dependent on external conditions that cannot be the same in different harvesting areas located far away from each other. For these reasons, some factors were excluded from the method used, although, of course, it is not desirable. But in spite of all the above, the results might be useful for forestry companies to justify the selection of harvesting technology and systems of machines based not only on technical and economic factors, but also on the working conditions of personnel involved.
