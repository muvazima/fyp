                  Traditional methods of applying classification models into the area of credit scoring may ignore the effect from censoring. Survival analysis has been introduced with its ability to deal with censored data. The mixture cure model, one important branch of survival models, is also applied in the context of credit scoring, assuming that the study population is a mixture of never-default and will-default customers.
                  We extend the standard mixture cure model through: (1) relaxing the independence assumption of the probability and the time of default; (2) treating the missing defaulting labels as latent variables and applying an augmentation technique; and (3) introducing a discrete truncated exponential distribution to model the time of default. Our full model is written in a hierarchical form so that the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is applied to estimate corresponding parameters.
                  Through an empirical analysis, we show that both mixture models, the standard mixture cure model and the hierarchical mixture cure model (HMCM), are more advanced in identifying future defaulters while compared with logistic regression. It is also concluded that our hierarchical Bayesian extension increases the model’s predictability and provides meaningful output for risk management.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Under Basel II, banks are allowed to build their own credit scoring models to risk assess their customers and calculate the capital in need for the portfolio. It makes it more important to discover suitable scoring models to better understand customers payment behavior. Traditionally, credit scoring is modeled as a classification problem – loan applicant is either classified as credit worthy or credit worthless. Dozens of techniques have been proposed by numerous researchers, for details we refer the readers to excellent surveys (Crook, Edelman, & Thomas, 2007; Hand & Henley, 1997; Rosenberg & Gleit, 1994). Most of these approaches require a development sample that contains properly labeled customers who have been assigned to default group or non-default group based on their repayment history (Hand & Kelly, 2001) over an observation period. Such assignment is not always available, especially for long term products, which limits the applicability of such methods in practice.

Let us take a real industrial application as an example. One of the largest commercial banks in China wanted to build a scorecard before the end of 2008 for their mortgage business. Samples were selected from existing accounts where the average term of loan was over 10years. To obtain accurate label for each customer, we were forced to use data that were at least 10years old. In the rapid developing country like China, there is a dramatic change in economic environments, data that are too old cannot accurately reflect the current situation. Observation period cannot be too short either. Mortgage customers rarely default immediately after taking the loan. It will take some time before we can observe sufficient number of defaults to train any meaningful model. The time window is always determined by some ad hoc rules, such as vintage analysis. In this example, it shows in Fig. 1
                      that historically 70% of the defaults have occurred within 24months. Therefore, 24months was a good time window for selecting training data. The defaulting labels for customers were then determined according to their behavior before 31st December 2008 rather than the loan lifetime: that is, the data was right censored. However, the non-default group included customers that may default after the censoring time. Directly apply classification based method to this data set was inappropriate. Intuitively, ignoring the censoring effect may make the model unable to identify future defaulters since they were labeled as non-default in model development procedure.

Survival analysis, with its ability to deal with the censored data, has been introduced in the context of credit scoring. Exploratory works include Banasik, Crook, and Thomas (1999), Hand and Kelly (2001) and Stepanova and Thomas (2002), in which various standard survival models, both parametric and non-parametric, are applied and compared. These works are followed by Bellotti and Crook (2009) and Im, Apley, Qi, and Shan (2012) which both incorporate the time-dependent variables into the proportional hazards model, with (Bellotti & Crook, 2009) including seven macroeconomic variables as the time-varying covariates and (Im et al., 2012) combining all the external factors into one coefficient, which accelerates the occurrence of defaulting. Baesens, Gestel, Stepanova, and Vanthienen (2005) proposes several neural-network based survival models that allow the covariates to be incorporated in a nonlinear mode. Andreeva, Ansell, and Crook (2007) introduces a combination score method to capture the relationship between the customers’ profitability and the time of default. More recently, the mixture cure models are proposed in Yildirim (2008) and Tong, Mues, and Thomas (2012) on the consideration that the customers are latently divided into two groups. One group includes customers who will never default, and the other includes those who will. They use mixture approaches to model the event of default by two parts, an incidence part, which describes the probability of the occurrence of an event, and a latency part, describing the time of the occurrence given it would happen. These papers concluded that advantages of survival analysis are that, it can be used to better discriminate applicants, estimate defaulting probability as a function of time, assist banks to make decisions on credit management.

We retain the desirable properties of the survival analysis and complement it by extending the mixture cure model to a hierarchical model, the HMCM. First, we establish a joint multivariate normal distribution of the defaulting predictor and the logarithm of the hazard rate, so that the assumption of the independence of the probability and the time to default is relaxed. The covariance matrix estimated using our method can be used to test whether the dependency exists. It is also meaningful for banks, because a customer with higher defaulting probability may contribute more profit if he defaults later (Stepanova & Thomas, 2002). Second, a discrete truncated exponential distribution model is developed to accommodate two characters of the defaulting time for a fixed-term loan. That is, the reported defaulting time is discrete, usually monthly, and finite, as it is restricted by the loan term. At last, we incorporate the unobserved default labels into the model as latent variables, and augment them according to their posterior distributions, which makes our model flexible and easy to implement. Peng and Dear (2000), Corbire and Joly (2007) and Tong et al. (2012) have introduced such latent variable. However, they do not augment it but compute its posterior expectation which is required by the expectation–maximization algorithm. Since the likelihood under our model has no analytical form, the parameters are estimated using Bayesian method. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure is one of the approaches to deal with hierarchical models by generating the parameters with a Markov chain.

We compare and contrast the performance of the HMCM with the mixture cure model proposed in Yildirim (2008) and a logistic regression model. Via an application on a real data, we conclude that ignoring the effect of censoring will make the model lose its ability to identify the customers who default later than the censoring time. Our extension highly improves the performance of the mixture model in terms of identifying the future defaulters, even some of them default much later than the censoring time. From the correlation coefficient derived in our data, the riskier the customer, the longer he may survive. It reveals the reason why logistic regression underperforms the mixture models.

Our method is similar to that in Abe (2009) which used a hierarchical Bayesian extension of the Prato/NBD model to forecast customers future purchases. Through an empirical analysis on three datasets, they conclude that the customer purchasing behavior is better tracked and, most importantly, the correlation estimated provides significant insights in customer relationship management. Unlike the consumer behavior discussed in Abe (2009), the event of default on a fixed-term loan cannot occur repeatedly, so the Poisson assumption of customer behavior is replaced by a Bernoulli distribution.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The mathematic notations, the statistical models and how our extensions are made are described in Section 2. In Section 3, we estimate the parameters using MCMC algorithm and list the main results. An empirical analysis is conducted in Section 4 to compare our model with the logistic regression model and the mixture cure models proposed in Tong et al. (2012). Section 5 concludes our paper with several directions of future research.

There is a long history of applying exponential distribution to model the time of the occurrence of a particular event. Compared with other distributions, like Weibull, gamma or log–logistic distributions, the exponential distribution incorporates only one parameter which is the reciprocal of the mean, making it easy to capture the correlation between the probability of default and the time of default. It is also the reason why the parametric survival model is chosen over the semi-parametric survival models, such as Cox proportional model which make use of a series of non-parametric baseline hazard functions. Note that the standard exponential distribution is defined on the infinite domain. However, the default time of a term loan is finite (

                        ) and measured in a fixed period (usually monthly). As such, we first truncate the exponential distribution, so that the survival density function is

The above Eqs. (1)–(5) constitute the basic framework of the standard mixture cure models. We now generalize it by relaxing the assumption of the independence of the probability and the time of default. The correlations across the two Eqs. (2) and (5) are introduced as follows:

                         is the probability that a customer will default given he has survived after t. Two extensions make our model hierarchical with Eq. (1)–(9) as the sub-models.

With known y and the observed information, there are three cases of customers. The Customer with

                         to estimate these parameters (Gelman, Carlin, Stern, & Rubin, 1995). However, there is no analytical form of the integration. As such, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are applied to estimate the parameters, which are popular in solving hierarchical Bayesian models (Velarde, Migon, & Alcoforado, 2008).

We apply an MCMC method, specifically Gibbs sampling (Altuzarra, Moreno-Jimenez, & Salvador, 2007), to estimate the parameter

A Markov chain is produced while we iterate the above steps, because parameters are drawn based their values generated in the last iteration. Two issues may affect the result. One is the choice of the initial values. In this paper, we use the parameters estimated from the standard mixture cure models as the starting point. The other is the number of iterations for burn-in. It depends on the rate of convergence of the Markov chain, which is monitored by G-test (Geweke, 1992). If the Markov chain becomes equilibrium after I iterations, then we run the above steps for

                         times totally. The last M iterations are used to infer the parameters.

The full conditional distributions used in Section 3.2 are derived as follows. The joint distribution of all the parameters given the observed data is:

The data are sampled from one major commercial bank in China, who wanted to build a scorecard for its mortgage business before the end of 2008. The definition of default is determined by the roll-rate analysis. As is illustrated by Fig. 2
                        , customers with overdue payment in three periods (each period contains 30 delinquency days) were defined as defaulters.

Under this definition, 24months were chosen as the time-window. Thus, the original data contains 14068 customers who were accepted during the whole year 2006 to eliminate the effect of seasons (see Fig. 3
                        ). Each customer in the sample was observed for at least 24months to allow it to ’mature’, and no more than 36months so as to be kept ’fresh’. Models are built based on their performance during the observation period. Among all the 14,068 customers, 461 were observed to default before model building.

Besides, the performance of the customers was tracked until then end of 2009. There are 267 customers defaulting during this year. With traditional classification methods, these people are treated as non-default in the model since they were still repaying before censoring.

The final data we get include all the customers who defaulted before the end of 2009 and the same number of non-default customers randomly sampled from the original data. In total, 1456 customers are selected for model building and validating. Fourteen features are incorporated in the models, all of which are standardized on their means with a standard error of 1.

Logistic regression is a popular classification method which makes the use of Eq. (2) and treats δ as the default/non-default indicator. Parameters are estimated through maximum likelihood estimation. It is popular in the financial industry, and is often used as a benchmark in academic research.

We compare our model with the logistic regression model and the mixture cure models applied in Tong et al. (2012). They make use of Eqs. (1) and (2), and link the variables to the hazard rate by the Cox proportional hazards model (Cox, 2009). EM algorithm is run to estimate the corresponding parameters by iteratively maximizing the expected log-likelihood (Sy & Taylor, 2000). Since the baseline hazard function is non-parametric, the probability that a customer default in a time where no default occurs cannot be estimated. We complete the estimation by using the ETAIL constraint scheme (Peng, 2003).

Our method to validate the models can be viewed as a combination of the 10-fold cross validation method and an out-of-time method.

In the procedure of estimating the parameters, to avoid over-fitting, the total sample are randomly segmented into 10 equally-sized folds. At each time, 9 folds are selected to train the parameters for the customers in the remaining fold. After we repeat it for 10 times, all the customers will be assigned with the estimated parameters. Then we can compute the quantities of interest for the entire sample, such as the probability of default before any feasible time.

Note that with the cross validation method, the information used for training and testing are virtually the same, because we develop and validate the model at the same time (i.e. the censoring time). However, customers who are not observed to default before the censoring time may default in the future. Therefore, a model which performs better at the censoring time may deteriorate if it fails to identify the future defaulters. We use a simple example to illustrate it (see Fig. 4
                        ).

Suppose there are seven customers ranked by the time they default. Two of them are observed to default before censoring, while another four will default in the future. The last one will never default. Three methods are applied to estimate the probability of default for these customers. Define 0.5 as the threshold. It means that any customer whose probability of default is beyond 0.5 will be rejected. The percentage correctly classified of these customers are reported in Table 1

                        , customer C3 becomes bad. The performance of M2 and M3 are improved since they reject this customer. As the number of defaulters increases, M3 becomes better and better as it identifies all the bad customers who default later. It is shown that the fluctuation of the model performance over time is affected by whether a future defaulter is identified.

Therefore, in the procedure of validation, we allow validation sample to change over time. As is depicted in Fig. 5
                        , we develop 13 validation samples based on the customer performance before the end of each month from December, 2008 to December, 2009 and name them from VS1 to VS13. To demonstrate the models’ robustness over time, we test the performance of the models in all the 13 validation samples while keeping the training sample unchanged. A good model is expected to not only identify the customers who default before censoring time, but also give a high probability of default to the future defaulters.

The KS and Gini are commonly used to measure how well the models discriminate between default and non-default customers (Finlay, 2010). KS is calculated as the maximum distance between the curves of the cumulative number of default and non-default customers when the number of the customers accepted increases. Gini is associated with the area under the ROC curves (Hanley & McNeil, 1982). To calculate them, we ranked the validation sample by the estimated probability of default.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The variable selections for the logistic model and mixture cure model are both performed by using the stepwise backward method. This method was applied by Tong et al. (2012) which sequentially eliminates the variables according to their p-value. In detail, at the beginning, all the variables are fit to the model and then the one with the largest p-value is removed. We iterate such step until all the p-values are under the threshold of 5%. However, selecting variables for our hierarchical mixture model is rather difficult, not only because that the Hessian matrix is hard to be computed with missing information, but also because that achieving the convergence of the MCMC procedure takes very long time. Thus, here we directly make use of the variables selected with the standard mixture cure model.

The MCMC steps were repeated for 15,000 iterations, among which the last 5000 were used to infer the posterior distribution of the parameters. Though it costs time to run MCMC algorithm, one advantage of such method is that the credible intervals can be directly interpreted. In Table 2
                           , we report the results of the estimation trained on the whole sample with the mixture cure model and the hierarchical one. Though we simply use the parameters selected by using the MCM, the 95% confidence interval in the last column indicates that such selection is acceptable. The absolute value of the parameters in the logistic model component related to HMCM is bigger than the MCM, indicating that the HMCM may be more discriminative than the MCM. Note that in the survival model component, no intercept is estimated for the standard mixture cure model, which is because that MCM has included a series of baseline hazard functions.

(26), and is the only choice of score functions for the LM. q denotes the probability that the customer will eventually default. Generally, all models show good discrimination, as the worst median values of KS and Gini are 0.474 and 0.528, respectively, which are within the acceptable range for business.

                                 V
                                 1
                              
                            these customers seem to be misclassified, which makes the mixture models underperform the LM at the beginning.

To further illustrate this, we plot the value of KS and Gini measured on the validation samples from 
                              
                                 VS

                            in Fig. 6
                           . Every point of the MCM curve in Fig. 6(a) is explained as the KS value calculated with the corresponding validation sample where the probability to default is set to be q, which is generated from model MCM. Fig. 6 shows that the curves of KS and Gini that related to the LM both start at a high value, reach the top at 
                              
                                 V
                                 2
                              
                            and then drop to 0.472 and 0.544 respectively. It means that only a few customers who default before or close to the censoring time have been identified, but the most part of the 728 defaults are misclassified, leading a negative slope after 
                              
                                 V
                                 2
                              
                           .

The shapes of the curves related to MCM are similar to the ones related to LM. However, compared with LM, the performance of MCM decreases later and slower (the absolute value of the slopes are smaller). It is because MCM discriminates more bad customers from good than LM. After 
                              
                                 V
                                 6
                              
                           , the number of future defaulters that is correctly classified is less than the number misclassified, which decreases the performance of MCM.

The curves related to HMCM start at the lowest point (0.474 for KS and 0.528 for Gini) and end as the highest point (0.575 for KS and 0.617 for Gini). The increase in KS is about 21.28 percent, and the increase in Gini is 15.01 percent. So our model is considered to be able to identify the majority of the defaulters, even some of them behave well in the observation period. This is the reason why our model performs worst at first but shows its superiority as time going further.

To compare the calibration performance among the three models, we compute the expected cumulative number of defaulters at each validation time from V1 to V13, and depict it against the actual one in Fig. 7
                           . Although LM provides a very precise estimation of the number of defaulters at the censoring date, it cannot forecast the numbers at other calendar time, for it only generates one static result, the probability to default, for each borrower. However, the inclusions of survival models in the MCM and HMCM make such forecast possible. From Fig. 7, we find that the calibration performance of MCM is better than HMCM in the first several dates but then becomes worse. The predicted increase of the defaults using both mixture model is less than the actual increase, which is illustrated in the figure that the mixture models overestimate the number of defaulters at the censoring date but underestimate it after some time. Such figure can also be used to explain some macroeconomic phenomenon. For example, when the curve related to the actual one exceeds the curves related to MCM and HMCM too much, then it may be a signal that the economy has worsened.

One major difference between the LM and our model is that we augment y at each iteration from its posterior distribution rather than let it equal δ. To show the effect, we build a logistic regression model on the augmented data in which y is predicted in the last iteration of the MCMC procedure. The result is reported in Table 5
                           . After augmenting missing labels by their posterior distribution, the performance of the LM is greatly increased, indicating that HMCM is able to discover the customers who are meant to default but have not yet been observed before model building.

The major difference between MCM and our model is that we relax the independence assumption between the probability and the time of default. The correlation between q and λ is introduced in our model through a multivariate normal distribution. Because the correlation between q and λ may be influenced by the covariates, the intercept-only model is also built to check whether the assumption of independence is satisfied. Table 6
                            reports the variance and covariance estimated by HMCM with and without covariates. For the intercept-only model, the coefficient of correlation is −0.309, which is significantly below zero. The distribution obtained from the repeated MCMC steps is drawn in Fig. 8
                           , implying that there is a negative correlation between q and λ in our sample. It means that riskier customers tend to default later. Therefore, if the observation period is not long enough, then many high-risk customers will be incorrectly classed as non-defaulting in the development sample. And, though 70 percent of bad accounts are observed, the LM still lacks predictability, as part of the most representative defaulters (those with the highest defaulting probabilities) are neglected.

Banks may also show its interest to risk rank customers over time which cannot be accomplished with LM. In Fig. 9
                            we depict the KS and Gini validated on the samples of applicants whose defaulting probabilities before the corresponding date are set to be 
                              
                                 1
                                 -
                                 S
                                 (
                                 t
                                 )
                              
                           . The MCM performs better at the early points, but is finally surpassed by HMCM, possibly because the latency part of the MCM is more flexible as it does not specify a particular distribution for the defaulting time but rather fits it by a set of baseline hazard functions. Only in the tail where no default is observed is the defaulting time assumed to follow an exponential distribution.

Besides the inference of the parameters, the MCMC procedure has generated other byproducts, such as the posterior expectation of the latent variable y which is also the posterior probability to default based on the observed data. With MCM, such probability should be computed with Eq. (9). Banks can score the existing borrowers with these updated defaulting probabilities. The result is shown in Table 7
                           .

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We start our paper with an industry application and show that the problem of censoring will be caused while the loan term is long. Though several survival models have been applied to solve this problem, there are a lack of papers to discuss the relationship between the probability and timing of default. We extend the standard mixture cure models by assuming the default probability and the shape parameter to follow a multi-variate logit-log normal distribution.

Through comparison with an LM and an MCM, we draw the following conclusions.
                        
                           (1)
                           Logistic regression performs best when the development sample and the validation sample are selected at close time sections (according to the excellent performance of LM in V1 as shown in Table 3 and the precise estimation of the number of defaulters at the censoring date). It implies that while building a scoring model for a short-term loan where the eventual state of each observation is easily known, logistic regression is highly recommended for its accuracy and convenience of implementation.

Mixture models, hierarchical or non-hierarchical, are more advanced in their ability to forecast customers’ future repayment behavior by generating an eventual defaulting probability q and the probability to default before any given time 
                                 
                                    1
                                    -
                                    S
                                    (
                                    t
                                    )
                                 
                              . Another advantage of mixture models is that predicting the time to default is helpful for the banks to better understand loaners’ behavior and provide timely risk control to their capital. Besides, customers’ exposure to risk and the losses that result from default are strongly related to the time at which they default. All of these factors make it more and more important to apply mixture models to predict not only if but also when the customers will default.

The hierarchical extension increases the performance of the standard mixture cure models in terms of discrimination and prediction. With the HMCM, we augment the defaulting labels according to the customers’ repaying behavior during the observation period. From this approach, some latent defaulters are discriminated from the those who will never default, leading our model to be more predictable. The correlation derived in our sample is significantly below zero, implying that in our data higher risk customers tend to default later. Thus, some typical bad customers were not observed to default and were misspecified as good for training with the LM. That may be one of the reasons why the LM deteriorates with time.

By using the MCMC estimation method, we derive the posterior expectation of the defaulting probability as a byproduct. With this, banks may build credit scoring system that not only predicts the probability of default for the new applicants but also updates the existing borrowers’ credit worthiness according to their performance.

One weakness of HMCM is that the zero-mode exponential distribution may not fit the borrowers behavior. The related density function is monotone decreasing, which is not accordance with variance in the number of defaults across time. Future research topic would be to search for flexible models of borrower behavior.

Another weakness is that the closed-form expressions for the defaulting probability of a new customer cannot be derived. We estimate it in Section 3 by MCMC integration method. As is pointed by Abe (2009), closed-form expressions would provide a better understanding of the effect from each variable. Similar to the experiment conducted in Section 4, we can complement our model by applying logistic regression on the augmented data with default labels predicted in the MCMC iteration. Then we can derive the analytical expressions for default probability while retaining the desirable metrics of our model, such as the ability to identify future defaulters and the ability to estimate the relationship between the probability and the time of default.

In this paper, we do not provide the variable selection for our model, since the MCMC estimation requires a lot of time and traditional selection method would be of computational burden. In addition, because some information, such as the timing of default for the censored cases, is missing, the Akaikes information criterion (AIC) cannot be directly obtained (Dirick, Claeskens, & Baesens, 2013). However, the MCMC method has been a very popular and important tool in the area of data mining. Thus, we expect useful and applicable techniques to select significant variables in this context.

Besides, future research can also be conducted by incorporating time-varying variables, for example, the interest rate, the house price index and so on. Researchers are also expected to apply our model on different samples to prove its effectiveness.
