                  This paper is concerned with the numerical solution of the unified first order hyperbolic formulation of continuum mechanics recently proposed by Peshkov and Romenski [110], further denoted as HPR model. In that framework, the viscous stresses are computed from the so-called distortion tensor A
                     , which is one of the primary state variables in the proposed first order system. A very important key feature of the HPR model is its ability to describe at the same time the behavior of inviscid and viscous compressible Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with heat conduction, as well as the behavior of elastic and visco-plastic solids. Actually, the model treats viscous and inviscid fluids as generalized visco-plastic solids. This is achieved via a stiff source term that accounts for strain relaxation in the evolution equations of 
                        A
                     . Also heat conduction is included via a first order hyperbolic system for the thermal impulse, from which the heat flux is computed. The governing PDE system is hyperbolic and fully consistent with the first and the second principle of thermodynamics. It is also fundamentally different from first order Maxwell–Cattaneo-type relaxation models based on extended irreversible thermodynamics. The HPR model represents therefore a novel and unified description of continuum mechanics, which applies at the same time to fluid mechanics and solid mechanics. In this paper, the direct connection between the HPR model and the classical hyperbolic–parabolic Navier–Stokes–Fourier theory is established for the first time via a formal asymptotic analysis in the stiff relaxation limit.
                  From a numerical point of view, the governing partial differential equations are very challenging, since they form a large nonlinear hyperbolic PDE system that includes stiff source terms and non-conservative products. We apply the successful family of one-step ADER–WENO finite volume (FV) and ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes to the HPR model in the stiff relaxation limit, and compare the numerical results with exact or numerical reference solutions obtained for the Euler and Navier–Stokes equations. Numerical convergence results are also provided. To show the universality of the HPR model, the paper is rounded-off with an application to wave propagation in elastic solids, for which one only needs to switch off the strain relaxation source term in the governing PDE system.
                  We provide various examples showing that for the purpose of flow visualization, the distortion tensor 
                        A
                      seems to be particularly useful.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

An attempt to build a unified formulation of continuum mechanics in first order hyperbolic form that includes fluid mechanics as well as solid mechanics has been very recently described by Peshkov and Romenski in [110]. The proposed model, hereafter the Hyperbolic Peshkov–Romenski (HPR) model, can potentially cover the entire spectrum of viscous flows ranging from non-equilibrium gas dynamics to Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, and even elastic and plastic deformation in solids, provided that the continuum description is applicable. In order to make this possible, the material element
                        
                           2
                        
                        
                           2
                           In fluid mechanics, the terms fluid elements, fluid particles and fluid parcels are also used.
                         view point is employed and the very essence of any macroscopic flow, i.e. the process of material element rearrangements, is explicitly described in the mathematical model. We note that the term material element should be understood in the conventional meaning of continuum mechanics, i.e. as an ensemble of a sufficiently large number of molecules or atoms.

An important difference between the HPR model and the classical continuum models is that the material elements not only have a finite size, but they also have an internal structure, which is subject to rearrangements, and which can be macroscopically described after introducing suitable quantities. Thus, in order to describe the deformability of material elements, a tensorial field
                           3
                        
                        
                           3
                           Rigorously speaking, 
                                 A
                               is not a tensor field of rank 2, since it transforms like a tensor of rank 1 with respect to a change of coordinates.
                         
                        
                           A
                           (
                           x
                           ,
                           t
                           )
                           =
                           [
                           
                              
                                 A
                              
                              
                                 i
                                 j
                              
                           
                           ]
                         is used. It maps the material elements from a current deformed state to the undeformed state, and it contains the information about deformation and rotation of material elements. While this approach is standard in the framework of solid mechanics, it is much less obvious for fluid dynamics. Because of the rearrangements of material elements, the field 
                           A
                         is not integrable in the sense that it does not relate Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates of the continuum. As a result, the field 
                           A
                         is local, see [110,70,77,78]. This is also the reason why we cannot call 
                           A
                         the deformation gradient, (or more precisely, the inverse deformation gradient), and thus, following [70,77,78], we shall instead refer to it as the material distortion field, or simply the distortion tensor.

In addition to the distortion field 
                           A
                        , another important information is required to describe rearrangements in a system of material elements of finite size. This information should characterize how easy or how hard it is for material elements to rearrange (fluidity). In the kinetic theory of liquids, Frenkel [60] proposed to use the average time 
                           
                              
                                 τ
                              
                              
                                 F
                              
                           
                         between two solid-like vibration states of an atom to describe the ability of a liquid to flow.
                           4
                        
                        
                           4
                           Frenkel's ideas have been discussed, used and extended during the last 20 years to compute the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of liquids, see [142,30,23,18,19] and references therein.
                         Following this idea of Frenkel, it was proposed in [110] to use a continuum analog τ of Frenkel's time 
                           
                              
                                 τ
                              
                              
                                 F
                              
                           
                        . Thus, in our continuum approach, the time τ is the time taken by a given material element to “escape” from the cage composed of its neighbor elements, i.e. the time taken to rearrange with one of its neighbors. The more viscous a fluid is, the larger the time τ, i.e. the longer the fluid elements stay in contact with each other. The limiting cases, inviscid fluids and elastic solids, are recovered when 
                           τ
                           =
                           0
                         and 
                           τ
                           =
                           ∞
                        , respectively, while for viscous fluids, the time τ is finite with 
                           0
                           <
                           τ
                           <
                           ∞
                         (see the discussion in [110]). We shall call τ the strain dissipation time, because, in the mathematical formulation of the HPR model the inverse time 
                           
                              
                                 τ
                              
                              
                                 −
                                 1
                              
                           
                         defines the rate at which shear strains dissipate during the rearrangement process.

Our material element point of view allows to formulate the system of governing partial differential equations (PDE) with rather convenient mathematical properties:
                           
                              •
                              First, the model is described by a system of first order PDEs. We recall that first order systems are less sensitive to the quality of the computational mesh and in general they allow to get a numerical scheme of higher order of accuracy than for a second order model on the same discrete stencil.

Second, the model is hyperbolic if the total energy potential is a convex function of the state variables, see [110]. In other words, the model is based on a wave formulation. Indeed, from the point of view of the physics of wave propagation and because of the causality principle, any macroscopic transport phenomenon should be considered as a wave propagation process. In particular, the momentum transfer in a viscous fluid in the transverse direction to the mean flow is nothing but a wave propagation process. These waves are known as the shear waves, which are very dissipative waves propagating over a distance that equals just a few wave lengths. Nevertheless, such waves give rise to very important phenomena known as boundary layers. Thus, one may expect that a physically based boundary layer theory has to be based on such a transverse wave dynamics. In full agreement with the above discussion, there are two types of waves in our hyperbolic model, longitudinal waves and shear waves, which transfer momentum in the transverse flow directions.

Third, the dissipative process of material element rearrangements is modeled by a stiff algebraic source term, i.e. this term does not depend on the space derivatives, which automatically implies that the characteristic speeds of the corresponding hyperbolic system are always finite (as they should), whatever the time τ is. One may recall that in hyperbolic Maxwell–Cattaneo-type models some characteristic speeds tend to infinity if the relaxation parameter tends to zero.

We also note that the system of the governing equations discussed in [110] has already been derived by Godunov and Romenski in the 1970s [74,70] in the context of elasto-plastic deformation of metals, for which it has been used by several authors over the years [116,64,9,73,7]. On the contrary, the idea that the same model could also describe the dynamics of any continuum, including inviscid fluids, viscous Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, elastic and visco-plastic solids was discussed in [110] for the first time. In fact, a very similar idea was proposed by Besseling in [16], but unfortunately it has never been appreciated in the fluid dynamics context. In order to allow a quantitative comparison also with the Fourier heat conduction theory, in this paper we extend the model proposed by Peshkov and Romenski in [110] by including also hyperbolic heat conduction equations, as proposed by Romenski in [96,116,115,114]. The essential difference of our hyperbolic heat conduction model from that proposed by Cattaneo [28] is that the speed of the heat propagation front is always finite, whatever the heat flux relaxation parameter is.

We emphasize that it is not our aim to provide a link with kinetic theory, although this could be very illuminating, but rather to verify the capabilities of the HPR model to account for a wide variety of dynamical systems.

The resulting governing partial differential equations of the HPR model, introduced in [110] and presented later in Section 2, are rather challenging from a numerical point of view, since they constitute a large system of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws that also includes non-conservative products and stiff source terms. To the best knowledge of the authors, the complete first order HPR model presented in [110] has never been solved so far by any numerical method in multiple space dimensions and including all terms, hence one of the main goals of this paper is to thoroughly investigate the behavior of the HPR model in a large number of different standard benchmark problems of computational fluid mechanics and computational solid mechanics.

It is important to mention that exactly for such a general class of nonlinear time-dependent hyperbolic PDEs, the families of ADER finite volume (FV) and ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods have been developed in the past decade. The starting point of the original ADER (arbitrary high order derivatives) schemes of Toro and Titarev et al. for hyperbolic conservation laws [137,122,131,140,132,134,49,24,135] was the approximate solution of the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) [59,15] that arises naturally in the context of high order finite volume and DG schemes, due to their piecewise high order polynomial data representation, for which the vector of conserved variables and all its spatial derivatives are known at a given time level. The ADER approach has been successfully extended also to hyperbolic PDEs with stiff source terms [43,52,82,139], to hyperbolic PDEs with non-conservative products [41,45] and to parabolic problems [63,136,37]. Recent developments include space–time adaptive meshes [53,46,146], moving meshes [40,21], ADER–WENO finite volume schemes for divergence-free magnetohydrodynamics [4,6,5] and a posteriori limiting of high order ADER-DG and ADER-FV schemes [93,54,149,148]. In the context of ADER schemes, first order hyperbolic reformulations of parabolic viscous problems have been tackled by Toro and Montecinos in [100,99,138], while a series of interesting previous work on first order hyperbolic reformulations of advection–diffusion equations was proposed by Nishikawa in [106,107]. Although not directly related to viscous problems, we also would like to refer to the well-known relaxation system of Jin and Xin [120], which allows to reformulate any nonlinear hyperbolic conservation law as an augmented linear first order system with stiff relaxation source terms.

In this paper, we concentrate our attention on compressible viscous Newtonian fluids, which in the classical continuum theory can be described by the hyperbolic–parabolic Navier–Stokes–Fourier (NSF) theory, as well as on elastic solids. It should also be noted that there are several advantages of a first order hyperbolic formulation of viscous fluids: first, the use of explicit Godunov-type shock-capturing finite volume schemes and, even more, the use of high order discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods is – at least in principle – straightforward for first order systems, while DG schemes need some special care in the presence of parabolic and higher order derivative terms, see the very interesting discussions in the well-known papers of Bassi and Rebay [10], Baumann and Oden [11,12], Cockburn and Shu [31,32], Yan and Shu [144,145,92] and others [1,80,81,86,29,63,44]. Second, the use of a parabolic theory can lead to a severe time step size restriction, if explicit time stepping schemes are used, since the infinite propagation speed of perturbations that is intrinsically inherent in parabolic PDEs is reflected in explicit numerical methods by a stability condition on the time step that scales with the square of the mesh size, while it scales only linearly with the mesh size for first order hyperbolic systems due to the classical CFL condition [34]. The situation is even worse for high order discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes, where the explicit time step size scales not only quadratically with the mesh size, but where it decreases even quadratically with the order of the method. In Section 4 we will show one numerical example with an explicit time stepping scheme, where the use of the first order HPR model is clearly more convenient in terms of time step size and CPU time compared to the classical parabolic Navier–Stokes theory. As a third and last advantage of a first order hyperbolic model, we would like to emphasize that, by avoiding the presence of infinite wave speeds even in the Newtonian framework, the new formulation suggests that its extension to relativistic continuum mechanics should also be possible.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we recall and discuss the extended hyperbolic Peshkov–Romenski model, denoted by HPR model in the following, including also a hyperbolic formulation of heat conduction. In particular, we show that the system is thermodynamically consistent and symmetric hyperbolic. A sketch of the analysis of the characteristics of the model is provided, together with a dispersion analysis of the wave speeds for relaxation times ranging from zero to infinity. We also carry out a formal asymptotic analysis of the system in the stiff relaxation limit, which reveals the direct connection of the first order HPR model with the well-established hyperbolic–parabolic Navier–Stokes–Fourier equations of viscous heat conducting fluids. In Section 3 we briefly summarize the numerical methods used to solve the HPR model in this paper, namely ADER–WENO finite volume schemes and ADER discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods, making use of the unified

In Section 4 we present computational results for a large set of different multi-dimensional test problems from computational fluid mechanics and also one example from computational solid mechanics, ranging from viscous low Mach number flows over viscous and inviscid compressible flows to the simulation of wave propagation in elastic solids. The paper is rounded-off by some concluding remarks and an outlook to future research in Section 5.

The unified first order hyperbolic model for continuum mechanics proposed by Peshkov and Romenski in [110], including a hyperbolic formulation of heat conduction, reads:

                        ; they are the so-called energy gradients in the state space or the thermodynamic forces. The Einstein summation convention over repeated indices is implied.

These equations are the mass conservation (1a), the momentum conservation (1b), the time evolution for the distortion (1c), the time evolution for the thermal impulse (1d), the entropy time evolution (1e), and the total energy conservation (2). The PDE governing the time evolution of the thermal impulse (1d) looks formally very similar to the momentum equation (1b), where the temperature T takes the role of the pressure p. Due to this similarity, it will also be called the thermal momentum equation in the following.

One can clearly see that in order to close the system, it is necessary to specify the total energy potential 
                           E
                           (
                           ρ
                           ,
                           s
                           ,
                           v
                           ,
                           A
                           ,
                           J
                           )
                        . This potential then generates all the constitutive fluxes (i.e. non-advective fluxes) and source terms by means of its partial derivatives with respect to the state variables. Hence, the energy specification is one of the key steps in the model formulation.

In order to specify E, we note that there are three scales involved in the continuum model formulation described in the introduction. Namely, the molecular scale, or the microscale; the scale of the material elements, called here mesoscale; and the flow scale, or the macroscale. It is therefore assumed that the total energy E is the sum of three terms, each of which represents the energy distributed in its corresponding scale. Thus, we assume that

                         is the only energy which does not disappear in the thermodynamic equilibrium where any meso- and macroscopic dynamics are absent, and only molecular dynamics is present. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the equilibrium energy. In this paper, for

                         should be taken into account when strongly non-equilibrium flows are considered. This would affect the computation of the pressure and of the temperature through the partial derivatives

The algebraic source term on the right-hand side of equation (1c) describes the shear strain dissipation due to material element rearrangements, and the source term on the right-hand side of (1d) describes the relaxation of the thermal impulse due to heat exchange between material elements.

After the total energy potential has been specified, one can write all fluxes and source terms in an explicit form. Thus, for the energy

In this section, we discuss a few additional important properties of the HPR model. We first illustrate the relation of the HPR model to the laws of thermodynamics and the important role played by the total energy potential. In particular, we demonstrate that the HPR model is compatible with the first and second law of thermodynamics, and that this automatically implies that the HPR model is a hyperbolic system of PDEs, i.e. the Cauchy problem for the system (1) is well-posed. We complete this section by unveiling the characteristic structure of the HPR model.


                           Overdetermined system of PDEs and the first law of thermodynamics. As many other models of continuum mechanics, the system (1)–(2) is an overdetermined system of PDEs. It consists of 18 PDEs for just 17 unknowns, and hence the natural question arises of whether it is consistent, i.e. whether it has at least one solution satisfying all the PDEs. This is in general not guaranteed and one needs to provide evidences that a solution satisfying all the PDEs of the system does exist.

In 1961, after discovering the mutual relations between thermodynamics, well-posedness of the initial value problem for systems of conservation laws and stability of numerical schemes, Godunov [68,67] concluded that an overdetermined system of conservation laws representing a continuum mechanics model is consistent if it is compatible with the first law of thermodynamics, i.e. with the total energy conservation. In order to illustrate Godunov's idea, let us consider equations (1)–(2) and let's also assume that it is an abstract system of PDEs, not necessarily related to the subject of this paper. Following Godunov [68,67,69], we now show that if the unknown function 
                              E
                              (
                              t
                              ,
                              x
                              )
                            is in fact not an unknown but a potential, depending on all other unknowns, i.e. 
                           
                              E
                              =
                              E
                              (
                              ρ
                              ,
                              v
                              ,
                              A
                              ,
                              J
                              ,
                              s
                              )
                           , then, if a solution of system (1) exists, it also satisfies equation (2), i.e. the system (1)–(2) is consistent. In fact, we have to use the so-called conservative variables, i.e. we should consider the potential ρE as a function of ρ, 
                              ρ
                              v
                           , 
                              A
                           ,

                              J
                           , ρs. After this remark, one can see that equation (2) can be obtained as a linear combination of equations (1) multiplied by the factors

Thus, identity (13) shows that if equations (1) are fulfilled, then equation (2) is also automatically fulfilled.

In other words, these two requirements form the closure for the overdetermined system (1)–(2), making it consistent.


                           Well-posedness of the Cauchy problem. It is not sufficient to propose a new continuum model that respects only some fundamental physical principles, but it is also required that the Cauchy problem for the proposed system of governing PDEs be well-posed, i.e. the solution of the system with initial data at time 
                              t
                              =
                              0
                            exists, at least locally, it is unique and stable. Otherwise, the practical value of the model would be questionable. In this context, hyperbolic conservation laws are very desirable for modeling dynamical phenomena, because hyperbolicity implies that the model is causal (finite speed of perturbation propagation) and that the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear PDE system under consideration is well-posed (hence, suitable for numerical treatment), see e.g. see [71,66,35,89].

From the discussion of the previous paragraph, it is obvious that the total energy potential plays a central role in the formulation of the HPR model. Moreover, we shall demonstrate that the convexity of the energy potential also guarantees that system (1) is symmetric hyperbolic, i.e. the initial value problem for (1) is well-posed.

As noted by Godunov [68,67,69], an interesting parametrization of overdetermined systems of conservation laws is possible. This parametrization allows to rewrite the original system in a symmetric quasilinear form. If, in addition, the total energy E is a convex function of the state variables, then the system is symmetric hyperbolic. After a careful analysis of a large number of models in continuum mechanics, the original observation of Godunov was later extended to a wide class of thermodynamically consistent systems of hyperbolic conservation laws in a series of papers [75,76,72,77,117,118] by Godunov and Romenski. All models belonging to this class of conservation laws are automatically symmetric hyperbolic. In particular, the system (1)–(2) belongs to this class, see [72,117,118]. Therefore, in order to demonstrate that system (1) is symmetric hyperbolic, we introduce the so-called thermodynamically conjugate, or dual, state variables, which are in fact the factors in (13):

                              We restrict the demonstration by considering only the left-hand side of (1) because the type of a system of PDEs is defined by the leading terms.

                            is equivalent to the convexity of ρE with respect to the conservative variable. In other words, the system (18), as well as (1), is symmetric hyperbolic if ρE is a convex potential of the conservative state variables, and the solution to the initial value problem exists locally. In turn, we note that via a direct calculation one can verify that the convexity of ρE with respect to the conservative state variables is equivalent to the convexity of E with respect to the primitive state variables ρ,

In practice however, and in particular for the ADER approach used in this paper, this was never a problem (see also the multi-dimensional numerical examples for nonlinear elastic deformation in [73,57]), and a weaker condition for hyperbolicity is used. Namely, due to the Galilean invariance of equations (1), (2)

The energy is the only quantity that is allowed to be transferred among all the three scales involved, namely the micro-, meso-, and macroscales. Therefore, the scales can interact only through an energy exchange, and the total energy potential has to be involved in some way in the mathematical formulation of this interaction. Indeed, the energy transfer from meso- to macroscale,

                           , is an irreversible transformation, which is controlled by the dissipative source terms in the governing equations for the distortion tensor, the thermal impulse, and the entropy. Thus, it is natural to expect that these dissipative source terms in the HPR model are also generated by the energy potential, via its partial derivatives with respect to the state variables. Indeed, the total energy conservation principle holds regardless of whether dissipation is present, or not. Thus, even if the dissipative source terms are present, we anyway have to have zero on the right-hand side of the total energy conservation law. Since the HPR model is an overdetermined system of PDEs, we require that the summation identity (13) holds. Hence, each dissipative source term is multiplied by the corresponding factor (conjugate state variables (15)) and the sum must vanish. Let us denote the source terms in equations (1c) and (1d) by

Understanding the characteristic structure of a hyperbolic system is an important step in studying the solution properties, because the solution of a hyperbolic model is a combination of waves propagating along the characteristic lines, e.g. see [71,35]. In this section we study the characteristic structure of the HPR model. First we shall present the characteristic structure of the viscous part of the HPR model (equations (1a), (1b), (1c) and (2)), then we discuss the characteristic structure of the heat conducting part (equations (1d) and (1e)), and eventually we close this section by presenting the structure of the entire model (1). It is also important to recall that the characteristic speeds of a hyperbolic model with stiff dissipative source terms are not the true sound speeds in the media, because these apparent sound speeds are strongly influenced by the dissipative processes giving rise to the phenomena called sound dispersion. In fact, the characteristic speeds of a hyperbolic system with stiff dissipative source terms are the high frequency limits for sound speeds [104].

We also note that the HPR model is fundamentally different from the classical parabolic NSF theory in the way it treats viscous and heat conducting phenomena. In the classical NSF theory, the transport phenomena are treated by means of phenomenological transport relations such as, for example, Newton's law of viscosity and Fourier's law of heat conduction, while in the HPR model all transport phenomena are treated from the wave propagation point of view. Thus, as it will be shown below, there are four types of sound waves in the HPR model, one for the transport of longitudinal (or pressure) perturbations, two for shear perturbations, and one for heat transfer, in contrast to only one pressure wave in the NSF model.

                            is the longitudinal characteristic speed. In the framework of solid mechanics, the existence of two types of waves comes with no surprise, but this is much less obvious for fluid mechanics. However, this fact is in full agreement with the causality principle and the wave propagation point of view on the transport phenomena, as it was already mentioned above.

Yet another point has to be explained. One may note that the characteristic velocity corresponding to the propagation of pressure perturbations in fluids modeled by EOS (4) or (5) is

                           . In fact, this is not a paradox. It is necessary to recall that for the hyperbolic PDEs with stiff dissipative source terms like system (23), the characteristic speeds are not the true sound speeds, but the true sound speeds are the result of a coupling of the non-dissipative waves modeled by the left hand side of (23) and the dissipative processes modeled by the algebraic source terms, and therefore the true sound speeds can be obtained only via a dispersion analysis. However, such an analysis is outside the scopes of this paper, some details of it are given just to demonstrate that there is no controversy between the sound speeds predicted by the HPR model and experimental observations on sound propagation in fluids.

The dispersion relation for a hyperbolic system of PDEs of the form (23) with algebraic dissipative source terms is [104]

We first concentrate on the relaxation limit of the viscous stress tensor 
                              σ
                           . For that purpose, we can ignore the rotational degree of freedom contained in the distortion tensor 
                              A
                           , since 
                              σ
                            is only a function of the symmetric tensor 
                              G
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    A

                              A
                           , which contains only the information about the deformation of the material elements. The temporal evolution equation of G can be obtained from Eqn. (1c) as
                              10
                           
                           
                              10
                              To obtain this PDE, it is necessary to sum up equation (1c) multiplied by

                            This completes the formal asymptotic analysis, establishing a direct connection of the stress tensor

                            of the HPR model with the known viscous stress tensor of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations, which is automatically recovered by the HPR model for small relaxation times

                           . At this point it is very important to highlight that in the HPR model, the viscous stress tensor 
                              σ
                            obtained in the stiff relaxation limit (50) is a result of the choice of a simple quadratic form for the contribution

                            to the total energy potential E, see Eqn. (6). In contrast, in classical Navier–Stokes theory, the stress tensor 
                              σ
                            is postulated as a constitutive relation right from the beginning.

Our particular choice of

                            has been made only in order to obtain a constant viscosity coefficient μ. In order to obtain a variable viscosity coefficient that depends, for example, on the temperature, like in Sutherland's law, it is sufficient to modify the function

                                    τ

                            accordingly.

So far, we see a possibility to make measurements of the HPR model parameters using experiments on high frequency sound propagation. For example, experimental results from [123] show that for the vapor of methyl-chloride (CH3Cl) at temperature 30 °C the low (adiabatic sound speed) and high frequency limits of the longitudinal phase velocity

The PDE system (59) is solved by resorting to a high order one-step ADER-FV and ADER-DG method [112,38,41], which provides at the same time high order of accuracy in both space and time in one single step, hence completely avoiding the Runge–Kutta sub-stages that are typically used in Runge–Kutta DG and Runge–Kutta WENO schemes. The method will be presented in the unified framework of

Throughout this paper we use the orthogonal Dubiner-type basis for simplex elements, which is a so-called modal basis, detailed in [36,84], while we use a tensor-product-type nodal basis for quadrilateral elements [54]. The nodal basis is given by the Lagrange interpolation polynomials passing through the Gauss–Legendre quadrature nodes on the unit square [126]. The symbol

                         the method reduces to a standard high order WENO finite volume scheme if a WENO reconstruction operator is adopted.

For WENO schemes on structured meshes we have found that it is particularly convenient to adopt one-dimensional stencils, each composed by 
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 e
                              
                           
                           =
                           M
                           +
                           1
                         cells, which are subsequently oriented along each spatial direction. The resulting reconstruction is still multidimensional, but implemented in a dimension-by-dimension strategy. A complete description of this approach can be found in [53,146]. For unstructured meshes, on the contrary, intrinsically multidimensional stencils are built, with 
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 e
                              
                           
                           =
                           d
                           M
                        , where d is the number of space dimensions. Moreover, the total number of stencils is seven, i.e. one central stencil, three primary sector stencils and three reverse sector stencils. Further details can be found in [48,47,133,141].

The local space–time Galerkin method is only used for the construction of an element-local predictor solution of the PDE in the small, hence neglecting the influence of neighbor elements. This predictor will subsequently be inserted into the corrector step described in the next section, which then provides the appropriate coupling between neighbor elements via a numerical flux function (Riemann solver) and a path-conservative jump term for the discretization of the non-conservative product. To simplify notation, we define

                         and is easily achieved with a fast converging iterative scheme, see [38,82,52] for more details. The above space–time Galerkin predictor has replaced the cumbersome Cauchy–Kovalewski procedure that has been initially employed in the original version of ADER finite volume and ADER discontinuous Galerkin schemes [122,131,140,132,49,127,48]. Note that very recently, a new reformulation of the ADER method has been proposed where reconstruction and time evolution are performed in terms of the vector of primitive variables 
                        V instead of using the vector Q of conserved quantities, see [147].

                         The element mass matrix appears in the first integral of (67), the second term accounts for the jump in the discrete solution at element boundaries and the third term takes into account the smooth part of the non-conservative product. For general complex nonlinear hyperbolic PDE systems we use the simple Rusanov method [119] (also called the local Lax Friedrichs method), although any other kind of Riemann solver could be also used, see [135] for an overview of state-of-the-art Riemann solvers. At that point we would also like to point out the new general reformulation of the HLLEM Riemann solver of Einfeldt and Munz [55,56], within the setting of path-conservative schemes recently forwarded in [39], as well as the family of MUSTA schemes, which has been applied to the equations of nonlinear elasticity in [130].

                         According to the suggestions made in [41,45,50,25,51], the path-integrals can be conveniently evaluated numerically by the use of a classical Gauss–Legendre quadrature formula on the unit interval

We stress that in our numerical approach, we solve the total energy conservation equation (2) instead of the entropy equation (1e), hence the numerical method is exactly locally and globally conservative for mass, momentum and energy, since for these equations it is written in flux form. Note that the only PDE of the HPR model for which there are non-conservative terms

                        , see (1c). To rewrite (67) in flux form for the cell averages of the mass, momentum and total energy equation we can use the fact that for these equations the corresponding rows of

As already stated in Sections 2 and 3, we emphasize here again that in the numerical computations shown in this Section, we solve the total energy conservation equation (2) instead of the entropy evolution equation (1e). Such a choice is necessary, since the model (1) and (2) is an overdetermined PDE system.

We first present a numerical convergence study on a smooth unsteady flow, for which an exact analytical solution is known for the compressible Euler equations, i.e. in the inviscid limit

The computational setup is the classical one of a convected isentropic vortex, see [3,83]. The initial condition is given in terms of primitive variables and it consists in a linear superposition of a homogeneous background field and some perturbations δ:

                        , together with the chosen values for the effective viscosity μ and the effective heat conductivity coefficient κ. For the higher order schemes, it was necessary to use smaller values of κ and μ, since the scheme otherwise converges to the solution of the viscous problem, while the reference solution is given by the exact solution of the inviscid problem (compressible Euler equations). From Table 1 one can observe that high order of convergence of the numerical method is achieved also in the stiff limit of the governing PDE system.

Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem the solution can be compared with an equivalent one dimensional problem in radial direction r with a geometric source term, see [135]. In our case, the 1D reference solution has been computed by solving the compressible Euler equations (i.e. solving the corresponding inviscid flow problem) with a classical second order TVD finite volume scheme on a very fine mesh composed of 10 000 grid zones and using the Osher-type flux proposed in [50]. The two-dimensional simulations with the full HPR model have been carried out with a third order ADER–WENO

As already shown in Eqn. (72), our numerical method is locally and globally conservative for PDE where 
                           B
                           (
                           Q

                           =
                           0

There are very few test problems for which an exact analytical solution of the unsteady Navier–Stokes equations is known. One of those is the first problem of Stokes [121], which consists of the time-evolution of an infinite incompressible shear layer. To get an almost incompressible behavior, we run the simulation at a low Mach number of

The laminar flow over a flat plate has been studied by Prandtl in his famous paper [111], where the concept of boundary layers was introduced in fluid mechanics for the first time. The boundary layer equations proposed by Prandtl were then solved for the first time in the special case of a laminar flow over a flat plate by Blasius in [17]. For an overview of boundary layer theory, the reader is referred to the well-known textbook by Schlichting and Gersten [121]. In the case of incompressible flow, the boundary layer equations take the following simple form:

In this paper, however, we use a shooting method based on the ODE solver proposed in [37], which is a special case of the space–time Galerkin predictor of the ADER approach, but applied to the simple case of a pure ODE.

The setup of the proposed numerical test case is as follows: the computational domain is

                         and a comparison with the Blasius reference solution is made. A good agreement between the numerical solution of the HPR model and the Blasius solution can be noted, despite the fact that two completely different mathematical models have been used to obtain them. This confirms the validity of the HPR model in the stiff relaxation limit when

                        . In the bottom panel we perform a direct comparison to the Navier–Stokes reference solution, by plotting the velocity across the flow as measured at

                           =

The lid-driven cavity is a classical benchmark problem for numerical methods applied to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, see [65,128]. However, it can also be used for compressible flow solvers in the low Mach number regime, see [42]. The computational domain is the box

                        , where also a comparison with the Navier–Stokes reference solution of Ghia et al. [65] is shown. We note a very good agreement between the numerical solution of the HPR model and the solution of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. In the bottom panels of Fig. 8, we plot two components of the distortion tensor 
                           A
                        , which is very useful to visualize the main structures of the flow. We would like to stress that the lid-driven cavity problem is challenging for numerical methods applied to the Navier–Stokes equations, since the boundary conditions produce a singularity of the velocity gradient in the corners, while the fluxes in the present hyperbolic formulation are well defined even for the corners.

The numerical scheme is now applied to a double shear layer benchmark problem, see [14,129], which contains a high initial velocity gradient. The computational domain is defined as

                         using a fourth order ADER–WENO finite volume scheme (

                           3
                        ) on a grid composed of 
                           200
                           ×
                           200
                         cells. In Fig. 9
                         the computational results obtained with the HPR model are compared with a numerical reference solution based on the solution of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We can note an excellent agreement between the two. The reference solution has been obtained with the staggered space–time discontinuous Galerkin finite element method recently proposed in [129]. In both models, the two thin shear layers evolve into several vortices, as observed in [14], and overall the small flow structures seem to be relatively well resolved also at the final time 
                           t
                           =
                           1.8
                        . In Fig. 10
                         we plot the time evolution of the distortion tensor component 
                           
                              
                                 A

                        . One can again observe that the components of the tensor 
                           A
                         are excellent candidates for flow visualization, since they reveal even more details of the flow structures than the vorticity plotted in the previous Fig. 9. The main advantage here is that in the framework of the HPR model, the tensor 
                           A
                         is one of the main variables already contained in the state vector Q of the governing PDE system, while vorticity needs to be computed from the velocity field via some post-processing technique.

In this section, we solve a test problem used in [101] and [37] in the context of sound generation by a von Karman vortex street that is shed behind a circular cylinder. The circular obstacle has a diameter of

                        . The computational results obtained with the HPR model are depicted in Fig. 13
                        , where also two numerical reference solutions based on the solution of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations, see [33,37], are shown. Overall, we observe a reasonable qualitative agreement between the HPR model and the Navier–Stokes reference solution. In the last row of Fig. 13 we show again a component of the tensor 
                           A
                        , which seems to reveal the vortex flow structures of the mixing layer even better and in a clearer way than the usual vorticity. This underlines again the potential of using 
                           A
                         for the purpose of flow visualization.

Another typical test problem used for the verification of numerical methods for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is the Taylor–Green vortex problem, which is another one of the rare examples where an exact analytical solution of the unsteady Navier–Stokes equations is known. In two space dimensions, the solution reads

                        . The distortion tensor and the heat flux are initialized as usual with

The computational results are depicted in Fig. 14
                        , where also a comparison with the exact solution of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is shown. Overall, one can note an excellent agreement between the HPR model and the reference solution, both for velocity and pressure.

                         is also drawn in Fig. 14 and reveals the vortex structures of the flow.

We now solve the Taylor–Green vortex problem again, but this time in three space dimensions. The computational domain is the box 
                           Ω

                                 π
                                 ,
                                 π

                        , with six periodic boundary conditions. For large times and large Reynolds numbers, the 3D Taylor–Green vortex is a classical example for the development of flow structures with smaller and smaller spatial scales, up to the onset of turbulence. The problem has been widely studied in literature and a reference solution is available via a direct numerical simulation (DNS) provided in the paper of Brachet et al. [22]. To obtain a low Mach number compressible flow, the following initial condition is chosen, see also [124]:

Further systematic studies of this important test problem will be carried out in the future, using substantially refined grids and higher order polynomial degrees in the numerical scheme in order to identify the cause for the observed deviation of the HPR model from the Navier–Stokes reference solution for higher Reynolds numbers.

                         is shown for the first order HPR model, together with a Navier–Stokes reference solution computed with an ADER-DG scheme [37] on the same grid. We note an excellent agreement between the two models. Furthermore, in Table 2
                         we list the computational time (wallclock time) and the number of time steps needed to reach the final simulation time in the context of ADER finite volume and ADER-DG schemes using two different grid resolutions for both, the HPR model and for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. With the above parameters, the explicit discretization of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations already runs into the parabolic time step restriction, which leads to a quadratic decrease of the time step size with mesh refinement and thus to a significant increase in computational time. Compared to the finite volume case, the situation is even worse for DG methods, where the discretization of the HPR model does not only require much less time steps, but also less CPU time than the discretization of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. We think that these results might be relevant for those readers who are interested in the discretization of viscous compressible flows with heat conduction using explicit time integration schemes.

The numerical test problems solved so far considered only either low Mach number flows, or at most weakly compressible flows. However, the first order HPR model is also valid in the case of supersonic viscous flows. Therefore, in this section we solve the problem of an isolated viscous shock wave propagating into a medium at rest with a shock Mach number of

                        , there exists an exact traveling wave solution of the compressible Navier–Stokes equation that was first found by Becker [13] in 1923. In the following, we briefly recall the exact solution of Becker, where the indices “0” and “1” denote the upstream and the post-shock states, respectively.

In this section we run a viscous version of the 2D double Mach reflection problem of a strong shock, which has been originally proposed for the compressible Euler equations by Woodward and Colella in [143]. This test problem involves a Mach 10 shock that hits a 30° ramp. Using the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions of the compressible Euler equations we can deduce the initial conditions for the flow variables in front of and behind the shock wave as

An inviscid reference calculation of the compressible Euler equations with the same ADER–WENO scheme on the same grid is also provided in Fig. 21, to show that the missing flow features in the HPR model are actually due to the presence of physical viscosity and not due to the effect of numerical diffusion. Overall one can observe that the typical flow structures like the incident shock wave, the reflected shock wave and the Mach stem are well reproduced. Furthermore, the typical mushroom-type flow structure close to the x-axis is also present in the viscous computations carried out with the HPR model. However, in this test problem, a rather large physical viscosity has been added, hence preventing the development of any unstable small-scale flow structures as observed in [3,54,149] and as obtained in the inviscid reference calculation. For other numerical results concerning the viscous double Mach reflection problem, see [37]. In Fig. 22
                         we also provide a visualization of the distortion tensor component

                        , which clearly indicates the presence of the shear layers and the mushroom-type flow feature, underpinning just once more the value of 
                           A
                         for the purpose of flow visualization.

The main key advantage of the HPR model (1a)–(2) is its capability to describe in one single PDE system the two main branches of continuum mechanics, namely fluid mechanics 
                        
                           and
                         
                        solid mechanics. We explicitly stress here that the test problem proposed in this section cannot be solved with the conventional Navier–Stokes equations, since it is a typical test problem of solid mechanics! Here we consider a typical benchmark problem used in computational seismology [88,87,85], consisting in the propagation of a wave in a linear elastic solid with free surface. The problem was first discussed and solved by Lamb in 1904, see [90] and is therefore often called Lamb's problem in the literature. The problem consists in a point force acting on an elastic solid, perpendicular to a free surface. In our particular setup, the computational domain is given by

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first time that a numerical method has been applied to the full first order hyperbolic Peshkov–Romenski model [110] with heat conduction, see Eqns. (1)–(2). The proposed family of high order one-step ADER finite volume and ADER discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes is able to discretize rather general hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations with non-conservative products and stiff source terms and has been applied in the frame of the HPR model to a large set of different test problems, ranging from viscous compressible fluids to elastic solids. We have shown numerical convergence results, as well as detailed comparisons with different analytical and numerical reference solutions. It is very important to stress again that the first order HPR model is able to represent the basic equations of continuum mechanics in a unified manner, including fluid mechanics and solid mechanics as two special limiting cases of the same mathematical model. The nonlinear material behavior is entirely governed by the equation of state and by the strain relaxation mechanism 
                        ψ
                     . To the knowledge of the authors, such a universal formulation of continuum mechanics in a first order hyperbolic system is unique and has never been tackled before with high order shock capturing methods for hyperbolic conservation laws.

Future applications will concern the extension of the numerical method to moving unstructured meshes in the frame of ADER–WENO–ALE schemes [40,21], as well as to non-Newtonian fluids and complex visco-plastic solids. The use of high order schemes for hyperbolic PDE on space–time adaptive meshes, as outlined in [53,46,149], might also become useful in near future in combination with the HPR model in the context of crack generation and crack propagation in nonlinear solid mechanics, following the ideas proposed in [57,58].

Since the HPR model has already finite wave speeds for all involved physical processes, i.e. heat and mass transport, as well as viscous momentum transport, future research will be carried out in order to extend it also to the relativistic regime, following the promising investigations by [79].

Because of that the EOS is assumed to be a convex function of the state variables V 
                     [110] and hence the HPR model is symmetric hyperbolic, the eigenvalues are thus assumed to be real, and can be found by analytical formulas as the roots of the cubic polynomial
