@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Residual stresses are developed during the solidification process due to the temperature gradients between different parts of casting or due to the mechanical constraints imposed by the mold during shrinkage of the cast metal and volumetric change and transformation plasticity associated with the solid state phase transformation according to Chandra [1]. A complex geometry means more internal sections which take longer to cool. Therefore, initially these sections are loaded compressively. This change to tensile loading as it contract within the already cold outer part. This increases the magnitude of tensile residual stresses produced on cooling of the cast.Since the residual stresses can increase or decrease the fatigue life of a component [2], an interest on its consideration during the design process has grown in the foundry industry. This paper presents a comparison of residual stress development between parts that has not undergone topology optimization processes.

The magnitude and distribution of residual stresses in a component or structure is a significant source of uncertainty in mechanical engineering design as it affects subsequent machining, life prediction and assessment of structural reliability. Residual stresses are generated due to almost all manufacturing and fabrication processes and can also arise during service; they will occur under any set of circumstances that leads to differential expansion or contraction between adjacent parts of a body so that the local yield strength exceeds the material value. Their influence depends on the magnitude, sign and extent relative to the controlling geometry. It is also associated with a particular mode of failure. Interpretation and optimization of residual stresses in terms of manufacturing history and service performance would mean better materials fabrication, processing and usage.

This work deals extensively with the simulation of residual stresses. Hence a lot of literature has been studied to model the optimum finite element (FE) problem. Liu et al. [3] have studied the development of thermal stresses and predicted the hot tearing and residual stresses in shaped casting. Ragab et al. [4] have used a coupled thermo-mechanical finite element model to simulate the die casting process. The simulation models show the effect of thermal and mechanical interaction between the casting and the die. It also includes the temperature dependent material properties of the casting. Metzget et al. [5] have studied a method to efficiently predict residual stresses in foundry product by FEM. Vijayaram et al. [6] have studied casting solidification simulation process which was used to identify the defective locations in the castings from the generated time–temperature contours. Afazov et al. [7] studied FE prediction of residual stresses of investment casting in a bottom core vane under equiaxed cooling and presented an investment casting simulation of the same to find the residual stresses. Xue et al. [8] did the numerical simulation of casting thermal stresses based on finite difference method using a three-dimensional code which was developed for solving thermal-elastoplastic stress problems during solidification process. Koric et al. [9] applied a three-dimensional transient explicit finite-element method to simulate the coupled and highly-nonlinear thermo-mechanical phenomenon that occurs during steel solidification in continuous casting of thin slabs in a funnel mold. Afazov et al. [10] presented a finite element simulation of an investment casting of a high pressure turbine blade under directional cooling.

In this work a shifter, as shown in 
                     Fig. 1, is taken as component of interest as it is a precision cast part. It is a component of four wheeler transmission system. This part seems to develop cracks during its service which has been credited to fatigue. Since residual stresses cause these crack formation under fatigue, the component is studied and analyzed for residual stresses.

The objective of this work is to simulate the formation of residual stresses during casting of a shifter and to identify the areas of maximum impact. The second objective was to modify the shape of the shifter so that lesser residual stresses may be developed during casting without affecting the functional integrity of the component.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

This work started with setting up a numerical problem to determine the residual stresses using a simple block analogous to the shifter. The block is treated as the casting and an enclosing bigger block, with exact cavity is considered as the mold. Since the residual stresses in the castings develop due to temperature gradients and structural constraints, the problem has to be defined, considering both thermal and structural loads. This is done in two phases, namely, before-shake-out and after-shake-out. In before-shake-out phase it is considered that the heat flows during pouring of molten metal into the sand mold at room temperature. In after-shake-out phase, the mold is removed and the cast is allowed to cool by itself at atmospheric conditions. Thus the heat flow between the cast and atmosphere is considered. In addition to the thermal analysis, this phase also considers determining the structural stresses developed due to the two temperature gradients obtained in the above steps.

The block model is first put through the simulation to get the optimum mesh pattern and element size. Then, the same conditions are applied to the shifter. Depending on the stress field, the next step is to determine the optimum geometry of the shifter which will result in lesser residual stresses while maintaining the functional integrity of the shifter. To validate the results, the modified shifter is tested experimentally using crack compliance method. This method gives strain values which have to be converted to stress. The complete methodology can be summarized as shown in 
                     Fig. 2.

The residual stresses are obtained by solving a two stage problem. In first phase, the temperature distribution is determined by cooling the component and in second phase, this prescribed temperature history is used to find the developed residual stresses by an elastoplastic analysis. The governing equations of these two phases are presented below. These equations form the very basis for the finite element analysis. Consider a block analogous to casting (shifter) as shown in 
                     Fig. 3. The length of the block is much larger than the width, so that heat transfer occurs through the area A only. Assuming ρ as the block density and isobaric specific heat as cp (since casting process will be at constant pressure), consider a small element of length Δx at a distance x from the origin. An energy balance on this thin element during a small time interval can be expressed as follows.

This is done in order to consider the heat flow in all three directions. The solidification heat transfer system considered in the analysis includes one important component called the latent heat of the casting alloy. The latent heat (L) is released when the temperature of the casting metal falls in the solidification range and the phase change occurs [11]. Enthalpy method [12] is used to incorporate the effect of latent heat in the calculations. The essential feature of the basic enthalpy method is that the evolution of the latent heat is accounted for by the enthalpy as well as the relationship between the enthalpy and temperature. The relationship between the enthalpy and temperature can be defined in terms of the latent heat release characteristics of the phase change material. This relationship is usually assumed to be a linear function for non-isothermal phase change cases.


                     
                     Fig. 4 shows the enthalpy temperature curves for such a case. The enthalpy as a function of temperature is given by Eq. (15)

The complete finite element model was created and meshed in ANSYS 12.0. To get the most accurate mesh pattern and the optimum element size, a simple cast block is taken as an example. The element type selected for residual stress analysis is SOLID 227 as it is a coupled field element with 10 nodes, each node having five degrees of freedom. It is a quadratic element type with a pyramid shape and supports structural as well as thermal loads. After three iterations, the element size for the cast and mold were selected as 2.3mm and 4mm respectively. 
                     Fig. 5(a) shows the fully meshed shifter. The material for the shifter and the sample block is taken as cast steel. The geometrical and material properties for the shifter cast and mold are given in Table 1. In both the original and the sample block, mold is taken as a simple cube surrounding the cast part larger in size, with appropriate cavity provided for casting. The mold material is taken as sand. Half symmetry boundary conditions are used in the analysis to reduce time and memory required for computation. Fig. 5(b) shows the shifter and cast assembly mesh utilizing the half symmetry boundary conditions. The analysis procedure involves following three steps.

In this phase analysis of the heat flow that takes place when the molten metal (at temperature 1400°C) is poured into the sand mold at room temperature (25°C) is done. Due to the high temperature gradient, heat transfer occurs by all the three modes, i.e. conduction, convection and radiation. Conduction takes place between the external surface of the casting and the inner surface of the mold cavity. Convection and radiation take place between the external surface of the mold and the ambient. Thus three types of loads were given on the shifter and mold outer walls. The symmetry face was given insulation boundary conditions as the temperature distributions will be mirrored across this face and hence it will not directly participate in the heat transfer through convection or radiation. The boundary conditions are as shown in 
                        Fig. 6(a). Thus a transient thermal analysis is simulated for 8h of mold filling and cooling time with these boundary conditions in ANSYS 12.0. Time step size was taken as 10s which meant time incremented in steps of 10s. The thermal result file obtained from this phase was saved as ‘before.rth’ and was used later.

In this phase, the mold was removed and the cast was allowed to cool by itself in atmosphere. Thus the heat transfer takes place only by convection and radiation between the surface of the cast and the ambient temperature. The current temperature distribution is governed by the previous step and thus the before.rth file was read as temperature field input. In this case temperature dependent film transfer coefficients were used and the hot cast was kept for cooling in atmospheric condition for 12hours. Same time step size was used. Again the thermal result file was saved as after.rth and would be used as input in structural analysis.

This is the final step of the procedure and composed of finding stresses developed due to the temperature gradients obtained in the two previous steps. In this step structural boundary conditions were given to the shifter to fix its position in space so that no rigid body motions were possible. For this purpose, one node in a plane parallel to x–z plane, at coordinates (0,45,0) was completely fixed. Another node at coordinates (0,45,35) was fixed only along x and y directions. Degree of freedom along z direction was left unconstrained to allow for free shrinkage. A third node at coordinates (−50,45,0) was fixed in z and y directions. Now degree of freedom along x direction was left unconstrained. These structural constraints simulated the actual mold conditions and are shown in Fig. 6(b) below.

The resultant temperature distribution after the two thermal analyses is plotted as shown in 
                        Fig. 7(a). Here the temperature range varies from 25.02°C to 32.432°C. This is the condition 20h after filling the mold, i.e. after shakeout. As it is clear from the plot, the temperature is highest in the middle of the cast due to differential cooling. The result of the structural analyses was taken as a plot of von-mises stress shown in Fig. 7(b). The figure shows the stresses developed due to differential cooling of the cast and the structural constraints imposed by the mold. This is done by considering complete absence of external structural loads. As it can be seen from the von-mises plot, the maximum values of stresses were obtained as 7.015 E+9N/m2. This is located at the top surface of the slot. Higher values were also obtained at locations where the heat transfer was obstructed due to intricate geometry. This finite element analysis provided the basis for the next step of work i.e. optimizing the shape of shifter for minimum residual stresses.

The main objective of this paper is to identify the areas of maximum residual stresses as crack formation starts in these areas. After identification of these areas, shape optimization process is started. The problem was to optimize the shape of the component to minimize the residual stress developed, subjected to the constraints of functionality and manufacturability. It is a non-linear, multiple variable optimization problem with component shape as the design vector and residual stresses as objective function. Several iterations are done to get the optimum shape while keeping the functionality and formability of the component intact. The iterations were stopped once further modifications resulted in complicated geometries which in turn indicated difficulties during casting or increase in production costs. The three dimensional model of the modified geometry is as shown in 
                     Fig. 8. The different modifications can be easily spotted on comparison with Fig. 1 which shows the original geometry. 
                     Fig. 9 shows the manufactured part.

This new geometry is subjected to the same thermal and structural boundary conditions as before and finite element analysis is done to get the von mises plot as shown in 
                     Fig. 10. The maximum values are obtained as 6.352E+9N/m2. On comparison with Fig. 7(b), the results clearly show a decrease in the stress throughout the cast. Also the stress distribution is more uniform.

The numerical work is validated by using crack compliance method, also known as incremental slitting method. It is fracture mechanics based approach. A detailed literature survey is done before selecting this method though various other residual stress measurement techniques are available. This method involves the determination of a residual stress by successive extension of a slot and measurement of the resulting strains or displacements [14,15]. It is a destructive technique but has increased spatial resolution for residual stresses and increased sensitivity to low stresses. The basic principle of this technique is that the slit will be cut incrementally with depth (x-direction) and simultaneously the residual stresses will release on the plane normal to the slit (y–z). Strain gauges mounted on this plane will measure the strain change caused by this stress release after every increment [14].

The schematic of the experimental setup is as shown in 
                     Fig. 11. The setup is made for strain gauge measurements. The strain gauges are connected to NI 9219 4-Channel, 24-Bit, universal analog input module using tape wires. The NI 9219 input module is loaded on NI cDAQ-9171 chassis which in turn is connected to the laptop. In this method, a slot or cut is first made into the component using EDM wire cutting technique. It is known that every manufacturing process will induce some residual stresses in the component. Since the magnitude of residual stresses is important in this procedure, any contamination due to milling or slitting operations would have resulted in faulty readings. But in case of EDM wire cut, material is removed by spark erosion resulting in almost zero change in residual stress. Therefore it is selected for introducing the slot.

The first step involved is preparation of shifter surface for sticking strain gauges. In this work strain gauges of resistance 350Ω with gauge factor 2.02 are used. The surface is normal to the direction of cut. The surface is hand ground slowly using sand paper so that no additional stresses are introduced. Then it is cleaned using acetone to remove any oil or burrs. Strain gauges were positions and stuck using instant glue. They are placed along y and z directions. Strain gauge electrical connections are made from NI 9219 4-Channel, 24-Bit, universal analog input module using tape wires. Yellow and green wires connected the strain gauge along y-direction and blue and purple connected to the strain gauge along z direction. Proper water proofing was done using silicon glue. These connections are as shown in 
                     Fig. 12(a) and (b). Fig. 12(a) shows the connections from strain gauges and Fig. 12(b) shows connections to NI module. 
                     Table 2 shows the specifications for the NI data acquisition system.

The NI 9219 module was connected to NI cDAQ-9171 chassis. The chassis and the laptop are connected with USB cable. These electrical connections ensure that strain measurements happen continuously and are recorded simultaneously. The programming for the strain measurement using NI 9219 was done for the two strain gauges using NI LabVIEW 2013. This is as shown in 
                     Fig. 13.

Quarter bridge configurations are considered for each case separately. Destinations for saving files, output graph modes and scale factors are also set. The connections are checked using a counterfeit run. The setup is then mounted on the wire EDM machine as shown in 
                     Fig. 14. The programmer is then clamped the component for cutting and positioned it so that the cutting wire was 0.1mm away from the cutting surface.

It is made sure that the gauges are on the free end away from the clamping and that the cut is to be made along the x-direction. The EDM wire cutting machine was operated at low power and speed (0.5mm/s) with a brass wire while temperature-controlled de-ionized water kept flowing continuously, so that no noticeable thermal stresses are induced during the process. The brass wire was loaded on a spool so that the cutting length kept changing. This is done so as to keep the wire from breaking. After all the machine settings are done, the NI LabVIEW 2013 program is started and water is made to flow. At this point, the strain gauges are calibrated.

For 0.1mm the clamping table moved without cut and then it started cutting the shifter component verified by localized sparks as shown in Fig. 15. Fig. 16 shows the screen shot of readings along z direction after 0.2mm cut has been achieved.

At this point the stresses on the surface y–z are released which resulted in expand of the surface in the plane. This is called surface compliance due to the crack generated and hence the name. This expanding of the surface in y and z directions is measured by the two strain gauges along them. The slit is basically required just to cut the surface but was progressed up to 4mm to verify any further changes in strain field. 
                     Fig. 17 shows the final component after cutting.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Temperature and stress in an alloy steel investment casting are predicted with numerical and experimental methods. Numerical method involved an uncoupled structural-thermal analysis in commercial finite-element program ANSYS 12.0. The stress results as shown in Fig. 7 are consistent with the temperature distributions. Maximum value of residual stresses was obtained as 6.352E+9N/m2. Experimental residual stress measurements were carried out using crack compliance method along the depth of the cut which involved determination of residual stress by successive extension of a slot and simultaneous measurement of the resulting strains [14,15]. The progression of the slot causes the tensile residual stresses to release and the outer surfaces to displace and adjust the stresses. These displacements are measured by strain gauges with the experimental setup as shown in Fig. 11 and resulting stresses are measured directly using NI Lab-View software. The experimental test results gives values of stresses in y and z directions as 6.839E+9N/m2 and 1.058E+6N/m2 respectively at 0.2mm depth of cut. To convert these stresses into von-mises stress the following equation [13] is used.

Using Eq. (27), the value of von mises stress at 0.2mm depth of cut was obtained as 6.839E+9N/m2. This stress value is the maximum value of residual stress on the surface containing the strain gauges. Comparing this value with the maximum value 6.352E+9N/m2, obtained from finite element analysis, it is seen that the residual stresses obtained by experimental method are in good agreement. The difference in the two values can be credited to the non-linearity in the actual casting process and successive material handling.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper a numerical approach is presented to simulate the development of residual stresses in precision casting. An explicit finite element model is developed and applied to simulate the heat transfer and stress development during the solidification of cast steel in a sand mold. The finite element analysis showed the areas of maximum residual stresses. The maximum value was 7.015 E+9N/m2. The shape optimization is done to minimize the residual stress subjected to constraints of functionality and formability, and showed a decrease in the values of residual stresses. The maximum value for residual stress in the modified geometry is obtained as 6.352E+9N/m2. The experimental testing on the modified shifter gives the values of residual stresses as 6.839E+9N/m2. This value is closer to the numerical results. All these values are lower than the yield stress of the material 28E+9N/m2. Thus the finite element model used for simulating the residual stresses is proved correct. This model can be used independently in future to predict residual stresses in precision casting and also to reduce their magnitude by proper shape optimization, as all the simulation results are in good accordance with the accepted facts. The accuracy of the numerical method can be further increased by taking smaller time increments.
