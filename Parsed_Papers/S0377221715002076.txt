                  We analyze the effect of demand uncertainty, as measured by entropy, on expected costs in a stochastic inventory model. Existing models studying demand variability’s impact use either stochastic ordering techniques or use variance as a measure of uncertainty. Due to both axiomatic appeal and recent use of entropy in the operations management literature, this paper develops entropy’s use as a demand uncertainty measure. Our key contribution is an insightful proof quantifying how costs are non-increasing when entropy is reduced.
               
            

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

Entropy is a measure of uncertainty strongly advocated by Jaynes (2003) and originally popularized by Shannon (1948). Let D be a discrete random variable with probability mass function p = (p
                     1, …, pN
                     ), then entropy H(p) is defined as

                     A good introduction to entropy as a measure of uncertainty can be found in Abbas (2006). Maximizing Eq. (1) subject to constraints based on existing knowledge (e.g. the mean, support, moments, etc.) is known as the maximum entropy principle (Jaynes, 1957), and is considered a uniquely correct method for inductive inference (Johnson & Shore, 1983; Shore & Johnson, 1980).

Our work in this paper solidifies the theoretical connection between entropy as a measure of demand uncertainty and expected loss. Despite the concept of entropy being around for over 60 years, the operations management literature has been slow to adopt this uncertainty measure. Maglaras and Eren (2015) comment that “to the best of our knowledge, the operations management and revenue management literatures have not explored the use of ME (maximum entropy) techniques to approximate unknown demand or willingness-to-pay distributions.” Recently, however, entropy is being explored. References to entropy within both operations management (see for example Andersson, Jörnsten, Nonås, Sandal, & Ubøe, 2013; Maglaras & Eren, 2015; Perakis & Roels, 2008; Shuiabi, Thomson, & Bhuiyan, 2005) and related contexts are increasing. This includes the contexts of pricing models (Lim & Shanthikumar, 2007), portfolio optimization (Glasserman & Xu, 2013), and discrete optimization (Nakagawa, James, Rego, & Edirisinghe, 2013). Of particular interest, Andersson et al. (2013) numerically demonstrate promising performance characteristics of using entropy-based demand distributions for ordering decisions; our work complements this insight by theoretically connecting entropy and loss in a similar setting.

Existing theoretical connections between uncertainty and supply/demand mismatch costs are often based on a measure of spread or on stochastic ordering techniques. In this work we use entropy to connect uncertainty and expected loss in a way that is intuitively satisfying, facilitates numerical evaluation of uncertainty’s effects on mismatch costs, and is also theoretically justified. In addition, it enables the exploration of uncertainty reduction without restricting expected demand to remain constant as uncertainty is increased/decreased. For example, a retailer reducing demand uncertainty by transitioning from hi-lo pricing to everyday low pricing will most certainly see a change in expected demand (see discussion in Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang, 1997).

Variance is arguably the most preferred measure of demand uncertainty found in the inventory management literature (see for example Kwak & Gavirneni, 2011; Ridder, Laan, & Salomon, 1998; Taylor & Xiao, 2010). While intuitively, variance provides meaning regarding the spread of a distribution and hence, uncertainty; problems arise when one tries to operationalize variance as a measure of uncertainty (Jaynes, 2003, p. 345). In an often cited example, imagine a six-sided die with a known bias such that the expected value of a roll is 4.5 instead of 3.5. How can we assign probabilities to the six outcomes in this clearly under-specified problem? Following Jaynes’ logic, we should pick the probability assignment implying maximal uncertainty subject to the problem’s constraints. In other words, if every feasible probability assignment were to be evaluated by a numerical measure of uncertainty, then one chooses the assignment that has the largest measurement; to choose otherwise would imply additional information beyond that which is available. Thus, applying variance as an uncertainty measure to the six-sided die problem, assign probability, pi

                     1 = 0.3 and p
                     6 = 0.7. Unfortunately, this extreme placement of probabilities leads to dissatisfaction with the implied results. Should not some probability remain on outcomes of 2, 3, 4, and 5? Variance as an uncertainty measure leads to these counter-intuitive results and thus, maximal uncertainty and maximal variance are not equal.

More intuitive results are found when entropy is used in place of variance. Mathematically, we maximize

                      we find maximum uncertainty corresponds to p
                     1 ≈ 5.4%, p
                     2 ≈ 7.9%, p
                     3 ≈ 11.4%, p
                     4 ≈ 16.5%, p
                     5 ≈ 24.0%, and p
                     6 ≈ 34.7%. Outcomes of 2–5 are no longer an impossibility and much more in line with what common sense might dictate.

Besides entropy and variance (see Ebrahimi, Maasoumi, & Soofi, 1999, for further comparison of entropy and variance), other alternative uncertainty measures exist. A popular alternative to study the effects of demand variability is to use stochastic ordering criteria as done in Jemaï and Karaesmen (2005), Song (1994), Song, Zhang, Hou, and Wang (2010), and Xu, Chen, and Xu (2010). In all of these works, the authors confirm the intuition that uncertainty generally leads to increased costs. Though, specific cases where larger uncertainty is associated with reduced costs can also be found (Ridder et al., 1998). The previously mentioned works use of stochastic ordering lead to qualitative insight, but do not facilitate numerical connection of uncertainty and mismatch costs. Gerchak and Mossman (1992) enable more numerically driven computations involving uncertainty through use of the mean preserving transformation. Unfortunately, the mean preserving transformation, like the previously mentioned stochastic ordering techniques, assumes uncertainty reduction never leads to changes in expected demand. Common sense requires expected demand changes may indeed be a possible outcome of a demand uncertainty reduction effort; otherwise, why do it? Hence, the extant demand variability literature is largely void of a method of measuring uncertainty that enables us to numerically relate uncertainty and expected mismatch costs, is consistent with common sense, and provides quantifiable evaluation of uncertainty’s effect on expected loss.

Our use of entropy and its comparison to variance connotes mathematical risk. However, entropy is a measure of randomness and not a direct measure of risk; entropy’s calculation is independent of preferences among potential outcomes of demand. In contrast, risk measures, such as conditional value at risk (CVaR) or expected shortfall (ES) (see Szegö, 2005, Section 5), always depend on the distribution of losses. In this way, a reduction in a risk measure, by definition, quantifies a reduction in the “likelihood of loss or less than expected returns” (see McNeil, Frey, & Embrechts, 2010, chap. 1). Intuitively, a reduction in uncertainty should also lead to a reduction in the likelihood of less than expected returns, but this notion needs to be proved and that is the goal of this work. In addition, this work’s focus on uncertainty reduction enables a framework from which to value information, whereas the more common risk-centric focus is better geared toward optimizing ordering decisions (see related discussion in Choi, Ruszczynski, & Zhao, 2011, and references therein).

In this paper, we quantify the relationship between expected supply/demand mismatch costs and entropy in the context of a general stochastic inventory problem. We commence our analysis defining maximal uncertainty and subsequently examine the effects of reducing uncertainty. Consider the loss matrix

Some isoentropy surfaces for the N = 3 case are shown in Fig. 1
                     . For the general N-decision case, the constant h isoentropy surfaces are N − 2 dimensional hypershells lying in the N − 1 dimensional simplex

                      0 < pi
                      < 1. In Fig. 1(a) we see that for values of h near the maximal value log 3, the isoentropy contour is approximately circular, but for smaller values, they become more triangular. The contours are also geometrically symmetric in p
                     1, p
                     2 and p
                     3, as expected.

In Fig. 1(b), we show that for different values of h, the isoentropy contour can pass through different “loss regions” (separated by the thin red lines) with different optimal order quantities (OQs). Loss region D
                     2 consists of all 3-tuples (p
                     1, p
                     2, p
                     3) where an OQ of 2 gives the smallest loss. In loss regions D
                     1 and D
                     3, OQ of 1 and 3 give the smallest loss. When h = log 3—corresponding to maximal uncertainty—the optimal decision would be to order 2 units. However, after uncertainty reduction efforts occur so that h = 1.07 (say), the potential probability distribution consistent with that given level of uncertainty may be any point on the dotted iso-entropy contour. Since, the entire iso-entropy curve lies completely in region D
                     2 where ordering 2 units is optimal, then any money or effort spent on reducing uncertainty from h = log 3 to h = 1.07 is essentially wasted as the optimal OQ remains unchanged. However, when h is further decreased to h = 1, there are points on the contour corresponding to a change in decision. As the contour further expands (as h decreases) and passes through different loss regions, on average, the expected loss decreases. We formalize this crucial relationship between uncertainty (characterized by h) and expected loss in Theorem 1, Section 4. However, before we prove the main theorem, we prove some results concerning the geometry of isoentropy surfaces and set up some relevant notation pertinent to the theorem. We prove

We now define a loss region. The aim is to partition the “belief space” [0, 1]
                              N
                            into N loss regions where the index of the region corresponds to the optimal order quantity.□

Now we divide our analysis into two cases. Either S(h) lies entirely within DJ
                            or it lies in ≥ 2 different loss regions.

In the second case, S(h) is not contained only in DJ
                           . Instead, different parts of S lie in different loss regions. The indices of these loss regions form a subset of the integers I⊆{1, 2, …, N}. Defining Sj

                            is the unit normal in the direction of increasing h on S(h) and r is defined in Eq. (6). In the appendix, we give an explicit derivation of Eq. (15) and the definition of β. We also show that β > 0. Since S(h) only includes points 0 < pj
                            < 1, j = 1, …, N, r is always well-defined for all points on S.

The intuitive notion that uncertainty is the driver of expected loss in this context is now mathematically demonstrated. The proof makes few restrictions on the loss matrix. As such, it validates the appeal of entropy as a measure of uncertainty beyond the context of the demand uncertainty reduction studied here. In addition, there is a subtle implication contained within the proof that is worth pointing out. When starting at maximal uncertainty, the expected loss does not decrease immediately as one becomes more certain. One must sufficiently reduce uncertainty to a point where the loss-minimizing decision may potentially change before any benefits of uncertainty reduction can be expected. In common sense terms, do not pursue uncertainty reduction if it is not going to change your decision.


                     Theorem 1 establishes a link between a given level of uncertainty (entropy h) and the expectation of expected loss over a belief space (the surface S(h)). This is in contrast to linking uncertainty and expected loss for a particular N-tuple of probabilities. As is the case with variance or coefficient of variation as uncertainty measurements (see examples in Ridder et al., 1998; Jemaï & Karaesmen, 2005), entropy can be reduced and lead to an increased expected loss. For example, assume an N = 3 problem with the following loss matrix:

                      then the expected loss for this example increases from $33.33 to $35.00. This underscores the point that Theorem 1 refers to the expectation of loss over all N-tuples corresponding to a given level of uncertainty.

This paper explores the use of entropy as a measurement of demand uncertainty and places the relationship between demand uncertainty and expected loss on more firm theoretical footing. In developing the main theorem of this paper, intuition about uncertainty is developed and some advantages of entropy as compared to variance as an uncertainty measure are revealed. The intuitive notion that supply/demand mismatch costs are driven down by decreasing uncertainty is now confirmed in this setting. In addition, one notices that at any given level of uncertainty expected demand is not artificially forced to be constant for comparison purposes and multiple possible distributions are now consistent with any specified level of uncertainty. Through both theoretical and intuitive insight, entropy as an uncertainty measure provides results that contrast with those of (Ridder et al., 1998, Lemma 3) where larger demand variability, under the assumption of constant mean demand, is sometimes associated with higher costs.
