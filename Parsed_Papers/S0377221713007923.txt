                  This work deals with the continuous time lot-sizing inventory problem when demand and costs are time-dependent. We adapt a cost balancing technique developed for the periodic-review version of our problem to the continuous-review framework. We prove that the solution obtained costs at most twice the cost of an optimal solution. We study the numerical complexity of the algorithm and generalize the policy to several important extensions while preserving its performance guarantee of two. Finally, we propose a modified version of our algorithm for the lot-sizing model with some restricted settings that improves the worst-case bound.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) problem deals with a single location that faces a demand of constant rate λ. Placing an order incurs a fixed order cost K and a linear order cost c while holding an inventory unit incurs a cost h per unit of time. The goal is to determine a continuous-review policy of minimal cost. This problem has been solved for a long time by Harris (1913) in the early twentieth century and popularized by Wilson (1934). Since then, many extensions and variations have been studied including production capacity, backorders, perishability, multi-echelon systems (see e.g. Zipkin (2000) for a state of the art).

One of the important limitations of the EOQ model is the assumption of time-independent parameters. In particular, it assumes a constant demand rate λ, which is not realistic in many practical situations. Many authors relax this assumption and consider a more general model with time-varying demand rate λ(t). However they only solve the problem under very restrictive assumptions. Resh et al. (1976) consider a time proportional demand rate (λ(t)=
                     αt) with time-independent cost parameters. Later, Donaldson (1977) proposes an optimal policy for a linear demand rate (λ(t)=
                     αt
                     +
                     β) and Barbosa and Friedman (1978) generalize to power-form demand rates (λ(t)=
                     αt
                     
                        β
                     , β
                     >−2). This result is then extended by Henery (1979) to increasing log-concave demand patterns and Hariga (1994) who studies a more general model for any monotonic log-concave demand rate when shortages are allowed. Finally, Henery (1990) focuses on non-monotonic demand patterns in the special case of cyclic demands.

These papers use a similar general approach that consists in finding the optimal policy for a fixed number of orders over the planning horizon, then to determine the optimal number of orders minimizing the total cost. This concept has been studied and generalized by Benkherouf and Gilding (2009), who show that the optimal cost over a finite planning horizon is a convex function of the number of orders. However, this method requires specific properties on the cost function and therefore the papers mentioned above restrict their attention to specific demand patterns and time-independent cost parameters. There is no general technique to determine an optimal continuous-review policy for time-varying parameters without the restrictive assumptions discussed above.

As the problem is difficult for more general demand patterns, the literature proposes several heuristics such as the greedy (or myopic) approach. Silver (1979) introduces a heuristic where the length of a replenishment cycle is chosen such that the average cost is minimized (locally) on the replenishment cycle. This heuristic is inspired from the well known Silver and Meal (1973) heuristic designed for a periodic-review setting. Another heuristic, widely used in practice, consists of averaging the demand rate and apply the EOQ formula with the average demand to compute the order times. Goyal and Giri (2003) consider an extension of Silver (1979) with backorders and time-varying demand rate λ(t), production rate μ(t) and deterioration rate θ(t). They also use a greedy approach, optimizing the average cost on each cycle rather than globally. Many other heuristics and extensions have been considered in the literature. We refer the reader to Goyal and Giri (2001) and Bakker et al. (2012) for a review of deteriorating-inventory models with time-varying demand and to Teng et al. (2007) for some references on the Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) model with time-varying demand.

An important heuristic discretizes the time horizon and use dynamic programming techniques to solve the corresponding periodic-review problem. Indeed, there exists several polynomial time algorithms that are optimal for the periodic-review lot-sizing problem. In the discrete time version, the planning horizon is divided into n periods. In each period a demand occurs and an order can be placed to replenish the stock. Wagner and Whitin (1958) present an algorithm of complexity O(n
                     2), while Aggarwal and Park (1993) propose a O(n) algorithm to solve this problem using Monge arrays. However, it is very unlikely that the optimal solution for the discretized problem matches an optimal policy for the original continuous-review version.

More generally, the previous heuristics have an important drawback: They can perform arbitrarily bad (i.e. no guarantee of performance has been proven). Even in the periodic-review setting, Axsäter (1982) shows that the heuristic of Silver and Meal (1973) can perform arbitrarily bad. That is, on some instances, the cost of the heuristic is arbitrary large compared to the cost of the optimal policy. Similarly, the EOQ heuristic (that averages the demand and uses the EOQ formula) is also shown to perform arbitrarily bad (see Bitran et al., 1984), even if the average demand is recalculated whenever an order is placed.

In this paper, we aim to derive tractable policies for the continuous lot-sizing problem with time-varying parameters that have provable performance guarantees. A policy is said to have a performance guarantee (or a worst-case guarantee) of α if its cost is at most α times the cost of an optimal policy. In the periodic-review setting with time-varying demand, Axsäter (1982) shows that a policy that balances holding and set-up costs in each replenishment cycle has a performance guarantee of two. Bitran et al. (1984) extend the results of Axsäter to the case with time-varying holding costs. Recently, Van den Heuvel and Wagelmans (2010) have proven that in fact this worst-case guarantee cannot be improved for online heuristics, i.e. procedures that use a forward induction mechanism and cannot modify their past ordering periods. In addition, the authors propose a systematic way to construct problem instances for which such heuristics reach their worst-case bound.

In this paper, we apply the ideas of cost balancing introduced by Bitran et al. (1984) to the continuous-review problem and prove that the performance guarantee of two remains valid for this problem. We then show that the ideas developed are quite generic and can be extended to several important models from the inventory literature (production rate, deterioration rate, non-linear holding costs, models with shortages, time-varying order costs) while preserving the performance guarantee. We also improve the performance guarantee to 3/2, with some additional assumptions.

Note that Hariga (1996) applies a similar cost balancing technique to the time-varying demand model with shortages and compares its performances to several other heuristics widely used in practice. Although his study presents numerical experiments and compare the performances of the different techniques, it focuses on time-independent cost parameters. Moreover, the theoretical performance and complexity are not discussed in his paper. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to derive algorithms and prove their guarantee of performance for lot-sizing problems with time-varying parameters in a continuous-time setting.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we formally introduce the basic lot-sizing problem and useful notations to describe the solutions and prove their guarantee. Section 3 explains how to adapt the balancing policy of Bitran et al. (1984) for a continuous-time setting and prove that the resulting policy preserves the performance guarantee of 2. In Section 4, we introduce several extensions to the lot-sizing model and show how the balancing algorithm can be modified to solve them. Finally, we generalize the concept of cost balancing to present a new policy for the lot-sizing model and prove its worst-case guarantee is 1.5 in Section 5.

We consider a single location that faces a continuous demand with rate λ(t) at time t. We denote by 
                        
                           Λ
                           (

                           ,
                           t
                           )

                                 t

                           u

                      the cumulated demand over [s,
                     t]. Holding an inventory unit at time t incurs a cost h(t) per unit of time. We assume that λ(·) and h(·) are piece-wise continuous functions. Placing an order at time t incurs a fixed order cost (or set-up cost) K(t) and a linear order cost c(t).

The inventory level at time t is denoted by x(t). The inventory level at time 0, before placing the first order, is denoted by x
                     0. For the majority of the models presented in this paper, it is dominant to place the first replenishment at time t
                     0 such that x(t
                     0)=0 and λ(t
                     0)>0. Hence we will assume w.l.o.g. that the following initial conditions (IC) holds, unless explicitely said otherwise.

                     In what follows, a policy is defined as a set of rules to determine the ordering times and quantities for each instance of the problem. The objective is to find a policy minimizing costs over a finite horizon [0,
                     T] while satisfying all the demands. In particular, a policy that achieves the lowest possible cost for any instance of the problem is said to be optimal.

Without loss of generality, we assume that the procurement leadtime is null: All demands being deterministic, a deterministic positive leadtime simply shifts the decision earlier in time. We now introduce some useful notations and concepts for the rest of the paper. Let x
                     p(u) be the inventory level at time u, under some policy P and let

Given a policy P, a (replenishment) cycle (s,
                     t] is defined as a time interval such that an order is placed at time s, an order is placed at time t
                     >
                     s and no order is placed in between. We say that a policy satisfies the Zero Inventory Ordering property, or is ZIO, if it orders only when its inventory level is zero. Note that under a ZIO policy P, the quantity ordered at the beginning of a cycle (s,
                     t] is exactly Λ(s,
                     t), the cumulated demand over the cycle. Moreover, the inventory level can be easily expressed in cycle (s,
                     t] as x
                     p(u)=
                     Λ(u,
                     t). Hence the cumulated holding cost H(s,
                     t) of a ZIO policy over a cycle (s,
                     t] can be simply expressed as an integral of holding cost and demand functions.

In this section, we present the central idea of our algorithm. Roughly, the main concept is to balance in each replenishment cycle the holding costs with the fixed order cost. For ease of understanding, we first make similar assumptions as Bitran et al. (1984) who have investigated a periodic-review version of this problem. More precisely, we assume that the fixed order cost and the linear order cost are time-independent, that is K(t)=
                     K and c(t)=
                     c for all t
                     ∈[0,
                     T]. These assumptions will be relaxed in Section 4. Notice that without loss of generality, we can assume c
                     =0 as any policy incurs a linear order cost of exactly cΛ(0,
                     T) over the planning horizon to satisfy all the demands. Throughout the remainder of this section, we restrict our attention to policies that respect the Zero Inventory Ordering (ZIO) property, as it is dominant for the model we are interested in.

The concept of cost balancing is well known in the inventory literature and can even be found in the classical EOQ problem, where all parameters are time-independent. Indeed, it is well known that for this special case the optimal policy balances exactly the holding costs with the order costs.

In the time-varying setting, we introduce the balancing policy, denoted BL in what follows, which balances in each cycle the two parts of the cost discussed above. The BL policy is inspired from the periodic-review policy proposed by Axsäter (1982) and Bitran et al. (1984). In fact, it is a ZIO policy whose order times are determined by a forward induction as follows: A first order is placed at the last moment when the inventory is nonnegative. If the BL policy places an order at time s, the next order time is then defined as the last time t such that

                        Recall that H(s,
                        t) represents the holding cost incurred by a ZIO policy over cycle (s,
                        t]. As H(s,·) is a nondecreasing continuous function and H(s,
                        s)=0, inequality (2) is tight for at least one point in [s,
                        T] if and only if H(s,
                        T)⩾
                        K. When the latter condition is not satisfied then s is the last order time of the BL policy and the quantity ordered at s is Λ(s,
                        T), such that all the remaining demand is ordered at s. More precisely, we define the BL policy as follows:

                           Since Algorithm 1 uses a forward induction mechanism that does not modify past decisions, the procedure can easily be applied in a similar fashion to problems with an infinite or a rolling time horizon.

The BL policy is interesting for its simplicity and for the quality of the solution obtained. In particular, we show in this section that the cost of the BL policy is at most twice the cost of an optimal policy. We first present a lower bound on the cost incurred by any policy between two instants s

We now use this result to state and prove the following theorem on the performance guarantee of the BL policy:
                           Theorem 1
                           
                              For piece-wise continuous functions λ(·) and h(·) and constant functions K(·) and c(·), the BL policy has a worst-case guarantee of two. That is, the cost incurred by the BL policy is at most twice the cost of an optimal policy.
                           

Let P be a feasible policy for the continuous-review lot-sizing problem considered and let s
                              1,…,
                              s
                              
                                 n
                               be the sequence of order times of the BL policy. We prove that on any time interval (s
                              
                                 i

                                 i+1], the cost incurred by the BL policy is at most twice the cost incurred by P.

In this section, we discuss how the order times can be computed by the balancing algorithm in practice. We first turn our attention to the issue of computing the next order time t given the current order time s. From the definition of H(s,·), we have that H(s,
                        s)=0 and H(s,·) is a nondecreasing continuous function on [s,
                        T]. Hence there exists at least one solution t
                        ∈[s,
                        T] to the equation H(s,
                        t)=
                        K (unless H(s,
                        T)<
                        K). However, in most cases there is no analytical expression of t. One can then use classical root-finding algorithms, such as the bissection method, to compute an approximate value of t. The next ordering moment t′ found by such techniques is such that t′∈[t
                        −
                        θ,
                        t
                        +
                        θ] for a given precision θ
                        >0 and the final complexity depends on θ. For instance when using the bisection method, each computation of t′ requires 
                           
                              O
                              (
                              log
                              (
                              T
                              /
                              θ
                              )

                         evaluations of function H(s,·).

For some classes of functions h(·) and λ(·), like polynomial, exponential, sinusoidal, the integral H(s,
                        t) can be expressed analytically. Otherwise, one can use classical numerical methods to evaluate this integral with some precision error. In what follows, we assume that H(s,
                        t) can be computed (exactly) in time 
                           
                              O
                              (
                              1
                              )
                           
                         and we only focus on the complexity of determining the order times s
                        1,…,
                        s
                        
                           n
                         of the BL policy. Notice that the number of order times of the BL policy, as for an optimal policy, may be arbitrary large (for instance considering an exponential holding cost h(t)=
                        e
                        
                           t
                        ). Thus the time complexity cannot be bounded in general with respect to the instance size. For this reason we consider in what follows a natural restriction of the problem.

Assume that the demand function and the holding cost function are both upper bounded on [0,
                        T]. That is, there exists

The previous section presents a cost balancing technique for a basic continuous lot-sizing model, but the underlying idea appears to be rather generic. In this section, we apply this concept to several important extensions of the lot-sizing problem. Although in most cases Algorithm 1 cannot be used directly, we adapt the policy to the specific settings of each extension and prove that the performance guarantee of two found in Section 3 remains valid for these more general models.

The analysis used in Section 3 remains valid for nonlinear holding costs. We denote by h(x,
                        t) the holding cost value at t for holding x units in stock. The only (natural) assumption we make is that h(x,
                        t) is nondecreasing in x. The cumulated holding cost of a ZIO policy over a cycle (s,
                        t] is again denoted by H(s,
                        t).

Essentially, one only has to check that Lemma 1 remains valid in this context to ensure that the approximation result holds. The policy we propose in this case follows exactly Algorithm 1. This policy satisfies the ZIO property, thus the same arguments as the ones used in Theorem 1 hold and the performance guarantee of 2 remains valid in the general case of nonlinear holding costs.

In this section, we consider a model in which the inventory on hand at time t deteriorates at rate θ(t), incurring a per unit deterioration cost a(t). In a cycle (s,
                        s′], the inventory level x(t) satisfies the following first-order differential equation

                         which can be solved easily, see e.g. Goyal and Giri (2003). Note that even though we only present our results for the simple inventory model derived from Section 3, this equation can also be solved with production rate μ(t) and backorders.

The arguments used to prove the performance guarantee of BL remain valid in this more general context and thus the resulting algorithm is a 2-approximation for the model with perishable products.

The model studied in Section 3 assumes that replenishments are instantaneous. We now relax this assumption and focus on a model where units are produced according to a time-dependent, piecewise continuous production rate μ(·). In addition, let

                        denote the cumulative production capacity between instants s and s′. If a production starts at time s for q units, all units are available on hand at time s
                        +
                        t such that μ(s,
                        t)=
                        q. Each production start incurs a time-independent fixed cost K (the nonspeculative linear production cost is omitted w.l.o.g. as before).

Although classical production models assume that the production rate μ(t) is larger than the demand rate λ(t), for all t, we relax this constraint and consider a more general situation where the only assumption is that the production capacity is sufficient to satisfy the entire demand without stockout, that is μ(0,
                        t)⩾
                        Λ(0,
                        t) for all t.

Observe that a policy P cannot produce more than μ(s,
                        t) units during a time interval [s,
                        t]. Thus a necessary condition for P to avoid stockouts is that for any time t

When t
                        =
                        s, this condition simply implies that x
                        p(s)⩾0. According to this new definition, we modify the initial condition (IC) and assume w.l.o.g. in this model that x
                        0
                        =
                        x

                        (0) and λ(0)>0.

Note that in the special case where μ(t)⩾
                        λ(t) for all t, we have x
                        
                           min
                        (s)=0 for all s and the ZIO property remains dominant. Consequently we focus on policies that order at time s only if their inventory level is equal to x
                        
                           min
                        (s). In the remainder of this section, we call such policies MIO (Minimum Inventory Ordering) policies. In addition to Property 1, the final stock of a MIO policy must be null (x(T)=0). MIO policies are clearly dominant for our problem. Fig. 1
                         illustrates a MIO policy.

For a MIO policy P, we have x
                        p(s)=
                        x

                        t] consists now of an active period (s,
                        u] (when production is on-going) and an idle period (u,

                        is the independent part of H(s,
                        t). Notice that due to Property 1, H

                        t) is incurred by any feasible policy for the problem we consider.

We now present an extension of the BL policy to this production model, called PB policy in what follows. The algorithm for this policy is exactly the same as for the BL policy (see Algorithm 1) except that the holding cost H(·,·) is replaced by H
                        
                           PB
                        (·,·).

The PB policy balances in each cycle the fixed order cost K with the policy dependent part of the holding cost.

                           Theorem 3
                           
                              The PB policy has a worst-case guarantee of 2 for the general production model.

We now focus on a model in which backlogging is allowed and the per-unit backlogging cost is b(t) at time t. Moreover, we modify the initial condition (IC) and simply consider that x
                        0
                        ⩽0. The balancing policy for models with backlogging uses an idea rather similar to the one used in the basic model. It balances the costs incurred between two consecutive order times with the fixed order cost K. The main difference is that instead of using only the holding costs, both holding and backlogging costs are considered. However, the policy decides to serve or backlog demand in a way that minimizes the sum of the costs incurred over the cycle. Each cycle (s,
                        t] is consequently split into two parts: (s,
                        u], during which inventory is held, and (u,
                        t], when backorders accumulate.

In the remainder of the section, the balancing policy for models with backlogging is denoted BB. For a given policy P, let B
                        p(s,
                        t) be the backlogging cost incurred by P over (s,
                        t]. In addition, we denote B(s,
                        t) the backlogging cost incurred over (s,
                        t] by a policy that does not order in (s,
                        t) and whose inventory at time s is 0. Formally, the algorithm works as follows:

We now state and prove the following theorem on the performance guarantee of the balancing algorithm for models with backlogging:
                           Theorem 4
                           
                              The BB policy for continuous lot-sizing models with backlogging has a worst-case guarantee of two.

In Section 3 we restricted our attention to time-independent fixed order costs. We now relax this assumption and allow for monotonic time-varying fixed order costs and nonspeculative linear order costs. Specifically, we assume that function K(t) is continuous in time and either nonincreasing or nondecreasing with t, while c(·) satisfies for all ds

                        2, it is always cheaper to order at s
                        2, rather than order earlier at s
                        1 and hold the corresponding units for a longer period. One can notice that inequality (6) is the continuous version of the well-known nonspeculative assumption often encountered in discrete lot-sizing models.

If K(·) is nonincreasing (resp. nondecreasing) the holding cost H(s,
                        t)+
                        c(s)Λ(s,
                        t) incurred over a cycle (s,
                        t] is balanced with K(s) (resp. K(t)). The procedure is then applied in a forward or in a backward manner depending on the variation of K(·). Notice that Bitran et al. (1984) also define a forward and a backward method for the discrete time problem when ordering costs are time-independent. In our case, these two algorithms are defined as follows:

                              For time-dependent order costs, the forward (resp. backward) balancing policy has a worst-case guarantee of two when K(·) is a continuous nonincreasing (resp. nondecreasing) function.

In this section, we present a generalization of the balancing technique used in Section 3 and use it to improve the performance guarantee from 2 to 3/2. The idea remains to balance the costs incurred over a time interval (s,
                     s′] with order costs but we now consider the possibility to place additional orders in the interval. We present this modified algorithm in the simple situation of Section 3, in which order costs are time-independent and holding costs are linear.

Consider a time interval (s,
                        t] and let k be a positive integer. We define G
                        
                           k
                        (s,
                        t) as the minimum cost over (s,
                        t) incurred by a feasible policy ordering at most k times in (s,
                        t).

Note that a policy that minimizes the cost G
                        
                           k
                        (s,
                        t) is ZIO. Thus for k
                        =0 we have G
                        0(s,
                        t)=
                        H(s,
                        t) and clearly the BL policy incurs on each of its ordering interval (s,
                        s′] a cost G
                        0(s,
                        s′). We can generalize Lemma 1 to the following result:

For a given positive integer k, we propose the following balancing policy, denoted BL
                        
                           k
                         in the remainder of this section. Its principle is to balance G
                        
                           k
                        (s,
                        t) with (k
                        +1)K in each of its replenishment cycle (s,
                        t]. That is, given an instant s, the policy computes the largest instant t
                        ⩽
                        T such that G
                        
                           k
                        (s,
                        t)⩽(k
                        +1)K. Notice that in this case policy BL
                        
                           k
                         orders at instants s and t and possibly up to k times in the interval (s,
                        t). We call main order times the instants s and t, while the other order times in (s,
                        t) are called secondary order times. Although main and secondary orders play the same role in the final solution, we differentiate these two types of orders to simplify the definition and the proof of performance of the algorithm. The following result generalizes Theorem 1:

In contrast to the balancing policy presented in Section 3, the family of algorithms presented in the previous section does not fall within the class of online heuristics defined by Van den Heuvel and Wagelmans (2010) and enables us to design efficient procedures to solve the problem introduced in Section 2. In particular, the resulting performance guarantee can be as close as aimed to the cost of an optimal policy. However the problem of determining (analytically or numerically) the minimal cost G
                        
                           k
                        (s,
                        t) on an interval (s,
                        t) is likely to require a large computing effort, especially for large values of k. In this subsection, we first discuss the computation of G
                        
                           k
                        (s,
                        t) for an arbitrary k. Then, for k
                        =1, we show that the BL
                        1 policy can be computed in

In what follows, we assume that Λ(s,
                           t)>0. Otherwise, policy BL

                           (s,
                           t)=0). We also assume that h(·) and λ(·) are continuous functions.

We now turn our attention to the case k
                           =1, where the problem is to find a single optimal intermediary order. In this case, there is a single variable v
                           1 that we rename v for ease of understanding. If we assume that the demand function λ(·) and the holding cost function h(·) are once differentiable, we can compute the second derivative of f(·):

Unfortunately, there exists demand functions that do not satisfy inequality (8), even when the holding cost function is constant (see for example Fig. 2
                           ). However, we now exhibit two cases satisfying inequality (8). Both cases relax some assumptions made in the existing literature.
                              
                                 
                                    Case 1:
                                 
                                 
                                    h(·) and λ(·) once differentiable, h(·) non-increasing and λ(·) non-decreasing.

These assumptions relax the framework used in Resh et al. (1976); Donaldson (1977) and Henery (1979) to any increasing demand function.


                                    h(·) once differentiable, non-increasing and λ(t)=
                                    αt

                                    ⩾−2.

In this case −h′(·) is nonnegative and h(s,

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we introduce a cost balancing technique and apply it to continuous-review inventory models when demands and cost parameters are time-varying. We prove that the resulting algorithm has a worst-case guarantee of two for the lot-size problem with time-varying parameters. In addition, we show that the underlying idea is rather generic and can be adapted to several important extensions, such as perishable products, production systems or models with backlog. For specific demand patterns, we also improve upon the performance guarantee of two and propose a 1.5 approximation algorithm for increasing or power form demand. Finally, we show that the complexity of our algorithm depends mainly on the chosen precision for the approximation ratio. The resulting running time makes it an interesting practical tool for decision makers.

One natural direction for further research is to experiment the cost balancing technique on numerical examples and compare its performances with existing optimal policies or heuristics. Furthermore, we believe that the concept could also be applied to series systems.

In addition we require that two consecutive order times are separated at least by θ, that is t′⩾

                     θ. Therefore the BL policy orders at most T/θ times on the planning horizon. If the computational time to evaluate H(s,
                     t) is

It remains to prove that applying the bisection method with the precision θ leads to the expected approximation factor of 2+
                     ε. Recall that the next order time t′ found by the bisection method belongs to [t
                     −
                     θ,
                     t
                     +
                     θ], even if we impose t′⩾
                     s
                     +
                     θ. For conciseness we denote by ΔH(s,
                     r) the difference H(s,
                     r
                     +
                     θ)−
                     H(s,
                     r) for any instant r
                     ⩾
                     s. According to Lemma 1 and using the fact that H(s,
                     t)=
                     K, we can bound the cost ratio between BL and any feasible policy P on (s,
                     t′] as follows:
                        
                           
                              Case 1.

Therefore in both cases the performance ratio is bounded by 2+
                     ε. In particular, the previous inequalities are true for P an optimal policy and the result follows.

Consider a feasible policy P for the production problem and two consecutive order time instants s and t of PB. Similarly to Lemma 1, we establish that the cost

                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           t
                           )
                        
                      incurred by P on time interval (s,
                     t] is at least K
                     +
                     H
                     
                        min
                     (s,
                     t).

As already noticed, the holding cost of any feasible policy on (s,
                     T] is at least H
                     
                        min
                     (s,
                     t). Thus the inequality clearly holds if P orders (i.e. starts a production) in the time interval (s,
                     t]. Conversely assume that P does not order on (s,
                     t]. Let u
                     ∈(s,
                     t] be the end of the active period of PB in the time interval. We establish that the stock level in policy P is greater or equal to the stock level in policy PB at any point in time of (s,
                     t]. That is, the balancing policy PB carries the minimum possible inventory for a policy that does not order inside the time interval (s,
                     t]. First, recall that Property 1 ensures that the inventory level of any feasible policy is at least x
                     
                        min
                     (t) at time t. Note that for any z
                     ∈[u,
                     t], we have x
                     p(z)⩾
                     x
                     PB(z) as P satisfies the demand in [u,
                     t] without stockouts. In addition, since x
                     p(s)⩾
                     x
                     
                        min
                     (s)=
                     x
                     PB(s), x
                     p(u)⩾
                     x
                     PB(u) and PB continuously produces in [s,
                     u], we also have x
                     p(z)⩾

                     ∈[s,

                     T] is at least H(s,
                     t)=

Consider a feasible policy P for the problem with backlogging and let s

We start by noticing that the BB policy places its first order at time s
                     1, such that B(0,s
                     1)=
                     K
                     >0: Hence s
                     1
                     >0 and δ
                     bb
                     0
                     =0. For the last cycle, we distinguish between two cases, depending on whether s
                     
                        n

                     <
                     T, the BB policy incurs a total cost of H(s
                     
                        n

                        n
                     ,
                     T] or it does not and then its inventory level at s

The proof follows from Proposition 1.

In this proof, we modify the notation introduced in Section 2 as follows: For s
                     <
                     t and P a policy for the problem, let 
                        
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           t
                           )
                        
                      be the sum of the fixed order cost incurred by P in (s,
                     t] plus the linear order cost and holding cost incurred by the units used to serve demands in (s,
                     t]. For instance, assume that P orders at time v
                     ∈(s,
                     t] to satisfy demands in [u,
                     t] and at time r
                     <
                     s to serve demands in (s,
                     v). Then we have
