@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) have been found to act as etiological cofactors in several chronic diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity and neurological dysfunction. Immunosuppressive domain (ISD) is a conserved region of transmembrane protein (TM) in envelope gene (env) of retroviruses. In vitro and vivo, evidence has shown that retroviral TM is highly immunosuppressive and a synthetic peptide (CKS-17) that shows homology to ISD inhibits immune function. ISD is probably a potential pathogenic element in HERVs. However, only less than one hundred ISDs of HERVs have been annotated by researchers so far, and universal software for domain prediction could not achieve sufficient accuracy for specific ISD. In this paper, a computational model is proposed to identify ISD in HERVs based on genome sequences only. It has a classification accuracy of 97.9% using Jack-knife test. 117 HERVs families were scanned with the model, 1002 new putative ISDs have been predicted and annotated in the human chromosomes. This model is also applicable to search for ISDs in human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) because of the evolutionary relationship between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. Furthermore, software named ISDTool has been developed to facilitate the application of the model. Datasets and the software involved in the paper are all available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/isdtool/files/ISDTool-1.0.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections. Many insertions into the genome have taken place tens of millions of years ago (Blikstad et al., 2008). It's conservatively estimated that HERVs occupy 8% (Gifford and Tristem, 2003) of the entire human genome. Discovery, classification and nomenclature of HERVs followed an erratic path, which has led to different naming for the same sequences (Blomberg et al., 2009). In this study, the nomenclature (Kapitonov and Jurka, 2008; Smit et al., 1996) of RepBase/RepeatMasker (Jurka, 2000; Jurka et al., 2005) is used. Typical full-length HERVs are about 7–11kb in size and consist mainly of the coding regions for gag, pro, pol and envelope gene (env), flanked on both 5′- and 3′- ends by long terminal repeats (LTR). Most HERVs exist in the human genome with incomplete structure (Jern and Coffin, 2008), which contain multiple stop codons, insertions, deletions and frame shift mutations (de Parseval et al., 2001; Kim, 2001).

HERVs have been found to act as etiological cofactors in several chronic diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity and neurological dysfunction (Kim, 2012). Evidence from recent studies indicated that the envelope proteins of some HERVs families were expressed preferentially in human placenta (Kamat et al., 2002; Venables et al., 1995) and several types of cancer cell lines, such as ovarian cancer cells (Wang-Johanning et al., 2007), prostate carcinoma tissues (Wang-Johanning et al., 2003a), breast cancer cell line (Wang-Johanning et al., 2003b) and so on. It has also been reported that a conserved region in env, named Immunosuppressive domain (ISD), was translated in neoplastic cells (Benit et al., 2001; Lindeskog et al., 1993). ISD is a highly conserved region of transmembrane protein (TM) in env of retroviruses and with a typical length of 17 Amino Acids (AA) (Naito et al., 2003). A synthetic peptide (CKS-17) which shows homology to ISD inhibits immune function in vitro (Cianciolo et al., 1981) and vivo (Nelson et al., 1985). ISD is closely related to the immunosuppressive properties of retroviral envelope proteins (Benit et al., 2001; Mangeney and Heidmann, 1998), probably a pathogenic element in HERVs (de Parseval et al., 2001; Lindeskog et al., 1993). However, only less than one hundred ISD annotations in HERVs have been annotated by researchers so far, and it is only available in limited HERVs families with much redundancy.

In this paper, a computational model is proposed to identify typical ISD in HERVs based on genome sequences only. Among ten parameters of divided physicochemical property scores (DPPS) (Tian et al., 2009), hydrophobicity and hydrogen bond, that play important roles in immune system (Zhou et al., 2007), were selected for analysis. Combining position characteristic, hydrophobicity and hydrogen bond properties of amino acids with position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), a new hybrid feature extraction approach is proposed. Then weighted support vector machine (WSVM) is used to solve the classification problem of unbalanced samples. As a predictive algorithm for ISD, the model is more specific, more accurate and practical than some universal models for domain position prediction, such as Dompro (Cheng et al., 2006) and PPM-Dom (Sun et al., 2013). The model has a high classification accuracy using Jack-knife test. Using this model, massive DNA sequences corresponding to coding regions and LTR of 117 HERVs families were scanned. In addition, the model can also be applied to search for ISD in human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) because of the evolutionary relationship between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses (Antony et al., 2004). In order to facilitate the application of this model, software named ISDTool has been developed. This software consists of two modules, ISDFindera for amino acid sequences and ISDFindern for DNA sequences.

Amino acid sequences of HERVs, HTLV, STLV and MLV with ISD annotations were collected from NCBI (Sayers et al., 2012) at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/index.html. Sequences of HERVs and HTLV which are associated with human beings were used to train the model. A large number of sequences without ISD annotation were downloaded from websites to search for new putative ISDs in them. DNA sequences corresponding to coding regions and non-coding LTR of 117 HERVs families were extracted from a RepeatMasker output file named ChromOut.tar.gz (hg19, GRCh37) in UCSC (Meyer et al., 2013), which is available at http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips. Sequences of HTLV-1 were obtained from the Molecular Epidemiology Database (MEDB) (Araujo et al., 2012) at http://htlv1db.bahia.fiocruz.br, which involve DNA sequences corresponding to env and LTR genomic regions. Amino acid sequences of env of STLV-1 and MLV were downloaded from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) (Magrane and Consortium, 2011) at http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot. All Datasets above are summarized in Table 1
                        .

Training samples were prepared from the amino acid sequences with ISD annotations. Repetitive and singular sequences were removed from these initial amino acid sequences. Sub-sequences corresponding to ISD region in the remaining were extracted and used as positive training samples. The negative training samples consisted of two parts. One was obtained from random sequences in the regions lack of ISD, the other from overlapping sequences of ISD. This training sample preparation process could probably improve the identification accuracy of the model.

Because ISD is a highly conserved sequence and associated with inhibition of immune and inflammatory functions (Cianciolo and Pizzo, 2012), it is preferred that sequence position characteristic and several physicochemical properties of amino acids should be chosen as the candidate features. The DPPS descriptor, which involves electronic, steric, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond properties, is then chosen to characterize physicochemical properties of amino acids. In order to select appropriate physicochemical properties which have closer relationship with immunity, Fisher values of ten parameters in DPPS are calculated on the training sample sequences. In these parameters, V8 and V9 with larger Fisher values are chosen, which is consistent with known knowledge that hydrophobicity and hydrogen bond play important roles in immune system (Zhou et al., 2007).

Combining position characteristic of sequences, hydrophobicity and hydrogen bond properties of amino acids with PSSM, a new hybrid feature space construction approach is proposed. Standard PSSM is an effective way of encoding fixed size motifs into descriptors capable of being used to search sequences (Maudling and Attwood, 2004; Naughton et al., 2006), not involve physicochemical properties. In this paper, the motif has a size of 17 AA, just the length of typical ISD in envelope proteins. Twenty kinds of typical amino acids are considered. V8 and V9 physicochemical parameters in DPPS are clustered according to value similarity to meet requirements of PSSM. By PSSM, the position characteristic, hydrophobicity and hydrogen bond properties of a motif are mapped to a point in a three-dimensional feature space.

The support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on the statistical learning theory (Vapnik, 1999). The basic thought of SVM is to map the original data into a high dimensional feature space through a nonlinear mapping function and then construct a hyperplane as a discriminative surface between the positive and negative data (Cui et al., 2013). In this paper, feature data is normalized and weighted support vector machine (WSVM) (Chang and Lin, 2011) is employed to solve the classification problem of unbalanced samples (Fig. 1
                        ).

The model has a classification accuracy of 97.9% using Jack-knife test. The test is a cross-validation examination (Yuan, 1999), which allows the separation of a test sequence from the entire sample sequence suite, so that the remaining samples constitute training sets. The separated one is subsequently predicted and compared with its true value. The operation goes through iterations until each sample sequence has been traversed once (Manel et al., 1999). Jack-knife test is given by Matthews (1975):

@&#RESULTS@&#

The proposed model was used to search for new putative ISDs of 117 HERVs families from sequences without ISD annotations. A total of 94671 DNA sequences corresponding to coding regions and 148402 LTR sequences of HERVs from RepeatMasker have been scanned. 1002 new putative ISDs (Supplementary part 1) were predicted in coding region sequences, but no putative ISD in LTR. It agrees well with common sense, because ISD is a conserved region of transmembrane protein of env in coding regions, it does not exist in non-coding LTR. The exact locations of these new putative ISDs of HERVs in the human chromosomes have been described with CIRCOS (Krzywinski et al., 2009) software (Fig. 2
                        ).

DNA sequences of 737 env and 869 LTR genomic regions of HTLV-1 from MEDB were scanned, 490 new putative ISDs (Supplementary part 2) were predicted in env sequences, but only 4 putative ISDs in LTR.

A total of 157 and 97 amino acid sequences of STLV-1 and MLV corresponding to env from UniProtKB were scanned, 96 and 60 new putative ISDs (Supplementary part 3 and 4) were predicted.

Software named ISDTool for windows environment has been developed to facilitate the application of this model. This tool consists of two modules, ISDFindera for amino acid sequences and ISDFindern for DNA sequences, both of them receive sequences or file in FASTA format as input. As output, sequences and file are optional, and an ISD annotation will be appended to the original annotation line of an input sequence. The annotation will clearly indicate the starting and ending positions of ISD in the sequence. The software is easy to use, which automatically filters non-alphabetic characters, so that sequences in FASTA format on websites, such as NCBI, could be directly read and processed. ISDTool has a capacity to accept maximum 32767KB sequences input and the file input is recommended no larger than 200MB. For details, refer to the manual coming with the software.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

As a cross-validation examination of Jack-knife test, the model has a classification accuracy of 97.9%. As a self-test of the training sample sequences, the model has an accuracy of 100% to identify ISD of sample sequences. In addition, it is found that a model, just constructed from the samples of ISD in HERVs, has an identification accuracy of 100% to the samples of ISDs in HTLV, STLV and MLV, so ISDs of HERVs and the three retroviruses probably have a very high similarity in the three features selected, which is in line with the evolutionary relationship between them and becomes evidence of the model validation.

ISD is closely related to the immunosuppressive properties of retroviral envelope proteins, probably a potential pathogenic element in HERVs. The model is proposed to identify ISD in HERVs based on genome sequences only. It is hoped that this work will be helpful for those who are interested in ISD of retroviruses, especially of HERVs, and could provide valuable information to explore the relationship between HERVs and chronic diseases.

ISD is a conserved region in transmembrane protein of retroviral env and does not exist in non-coding LTR. However, in this paper, there are 4 new putative ISDs predicted by the model in LTR sequences of HTLV-1 from MEDB. The four corresponding LTR sequences, whose access numbers are Y16495, Y16496, AY342309 and AY342310, were extracted and analyzed. It is found that these four are annotated as env of HTLV-1 in NCBI as well as the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and all the triads have completely same DNA sequences (Supplementary part 5). Therefore, the four sequences, annotated as LTR of HTLV-1 in MEDB, may be actually coding env, not non-coding LTR. That is why the 4 new putative ISDs can be predicted by the model in the LTR sequences of HTLV-1 from MEDB.

The distribution of putative ISDs of HERVs in the 24 human chromosomes has been given in Fig. 3A and B. It is obvious that chromosome Y and 19 has higher ISD content per base pair (bp).

In addition, the number of ISDs in each HERVs family is much different (Fig. 3C), most ISDs belong to a few families. The seven largest distribution families occupy more than half the number of ISDs in a total of 117 HERVs families (Fig. 3D). Therefore, ISD of HERVs probably has family preference.

Motifs of ISD in HERVs and the other three retroviruses, including HTLV-1, STLV-1 and MLV, were detected based on the MEME version 4.9.1 (Bailey et al., 2009), which is devoted to discovery and analysis of sequence motifs. It is obviously that ISD sequence is highly conserved within each retrovirus itself. HTLV-1 and STLV-1, although involved in different species, have exactly the same ISD motif because of the close evolutionary relationship between them (Fig. 4
                        ).
