                  This paper examines the sailing speed of containerships and refueling of bunker in a liner shipping network while considering that the real speed may deviate from the planned one. It develops a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model to minimize the total cost consisting of ship cost, bunker cost, and inventory cost, under the worst-case bunker consumption scenario. A close-form expression for the worst-case bunker consumption is derived and three linearization techniques are proposed to transform the nonlinear model to a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. A case study based on the Asia–Europe–Oceania network of a global liner shipping company demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model and interesting managerial insights are obtained.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Liner shipping mainly involves the transportation of containerized cargo (containers) such as manufactured products, food, and garment (Meng, Wang, Andersson, and Thun, 2014). The unit value of the containers is generally much higher than bulk cargo. Hence, the speed of containerships is higher (e.g., 20–25 knots) to deliver the containers to their destinations in a shorter time. In fact, short transit time is important especially for consumer goods with a short life cycle such as fashion and computers (Notteboom, 2006). At the same time, the daily fuel consumption of ships increases approximately proportional to the sailing speed cubed (Ronen, 2011). Therefore, containerships burn more fuel (bunker) than other types of ships in general and hence it is vital for liner shipping companies to efficiently manage the bunker. For example, Ronen (2011) estimated that when bunker fuel price is around 500 USD per ton the bunker cost constitutes about three quarters of the operating cost of a large containership.

Bunker management has two aspects. The first one is optimizing the sailing speed. A higher speed implies a larger amount of bunker consumed; whereas it also leads to a shorter transit time and a smaller number of ships required to maintain a weekly service frequency. Hence, when the bunker price is high or when there is overcapacity of ships, liner shipping companies tend to deploy more ships to lower down the speed of all the ships plying to a service. Since 2007, many liner shipping companies have adopted the slow-steaming strategy to reduce bunker expenditure and curb the oversupply of shipping capacity (UNCTAD, 2011). It should be mentioned that containerships may not sail at a constant speed on a ship route. On legs with more containers to transport and legs where the bunker consumption is less sensitive to the speed, the sailing speed should be higher (Wang and Meng, 2012a).

The second aspect is the choice of refill port. Containerships load bunker at the ports on their itinerary to avoid detour. Some ports do not provide bunkering services. At the ports where a ship could load bunker (refill ports), the prices may also vary (Kim and Kim, 2012). Moreover, the quality and availability of bunker will be better guaranteed if a shipping company purchases a large amount of bunker at the same port. Consequently, a natural problem faced by a liner shipping company is: how much bunker a ship should load at each refill port?

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

There are some studies that focus on sailing speed optimization. Notteboom and Vernimmen (2009) and Ronen (2011) investigated the optimal uniform speed on a single ship route. Du, Chen, Quan, Long, and Fung (2011) and Wang, Meng, and Liu (2013c) have examined the possibility of slow steaming via collaboration between port operators and shipping lines. Qi and Song (2012), Wang and Meng (2012c), and Wang and Meng (2012b) have incorporated the choice of speed in a schedule design problem. Wang and Meng (2012a) studied the optimal speed on each voyage leg in a liner shipping network. Wang, Meng, and Liu (2013b) designed the speed while assuming that the container shipment demand depends on the sailing speed. Fagerholt, Laporte, and Norstad (2010), Norstad, Fagerholt, and Laporte (2011) and Hvattum, Norstad, Fagerholt, and Laporte (2013) investigated the optimization of sailing speed for tramp ships. Psaraftis and Kontovas (2013); 2014) and Wang, Meng, and Liu (2013a) have provided excellent reviews on studies related to sailing speed optimization models.

Little research has been devoted to the choice of refill port. Both Kim and Kim (2012) and Yao, Ng, and Lee (2012) worked on the speed optimization and the bunkering decisions based on a single liner ship route. Kim and Kim (2012) assumed that the bunker price at each port is independent of the bunkering amount whereas Yao et al. (2012) assumed a lower bunker price when the bunkering amount is larger. Plum, Jensen, and Pisinger (2014a) developed a mixed integer programme for bunker purchasing with contract that is solved by column generation.

The above literature review clearly shows that few studies have addressed the problem of joint speed and bunkering optimization for a liner shipping network. Moreover, all the aforementioned works have assumed that ships sail exactly at the optimal speed derived from mathematical models. However, as a consequence of factors such as wind and sea current, it is impossible for ship captains to guarantee that the real speed perfectly matches the optimal one. Therefore, the predicted total cost may be different from the real total cost and the planned “optimal” speed may no longer be optimal under the uncertainties of the real speed.

The objective of this paper is to address the practical problem of joint speed and bunkering optimization at the network level considering the uncertainties of real speed. We assume that the real speed may vary within a given range relative to the planned speed. For example, if the planned speed is 18 knots, the real speed may be any value between 17 and 19 knots. The captain will speed up (slow down) if the ship is behind (ahead of) schedule during the voyage to make sure that the ship arrives at the next port of call at the planned time. The bunker prices at different ports are different, and it is advantageous to refill at fewer ports to as the ports will guarantee better quality and availability of bunker. The liner shipping company designs the optimal (planned) speed and chooses the bunkering ports and the amount of bunker to load at each refill port, so as to minimize the worst-case total cost (ship cost, bunker cost, inventory cost) in view of the variability of sailing speed in reality. This problem is referred to as the robust bunker management (RBM) problem in the sequel. The contributions of the paper are three-folds: first, it takes the initiative to address the joint speed and bunkering optimization problem for a liner shipping network; second, it contributes the seminal mathematical model that considers the difference between the planned sailing speed and the real sailing speed. To the best of our knowledge, this practical consideration has not been mentioned in previous studies. Third, a number of interesting managerial insights from case studies are obtained and these managerial insights provide guidelines for shipping companies and refill port operators.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the problem. Section 3 formulates models for worst-case bunker consumption and the robust bunker management problem. Section 4 derives a close-form expression for the worst-case bunker consumption and proposes three linearization techniques for the robust bunker management model. Section 5 reports a case study based on the Asia–Europe–Oceania network of a global liner shipping company. Section 6 concludes.

                        where 168 is the number of hours in a week. The left-hand side of Eq. (2) is the rotation time, which is the total time required by one ship to complete a loop. The rotation time consists of the sailing times at sea and the port times. If, for example, the rotation time is 3 weeks, then a ship can re-visit the same port every 3 weeks. To ensure a weekly frequency, we will need to deploy three ships. Therefore, the rotation time (in hours) must be equal to 168 hours multiplied by the number of ships deployed.

A higher sailing speed implies a shorter transit time of containers, which leads to a lower inventory cost. Therefore we let β be the unit inventory cost of containers (USD per TEU per hour), and Wri
                         be the volume of containers (TEUs) transported on leg i of ship route r. Since the inventory cost of containers at ports is constant, we are only concerned about the inventory cost at sea, the sum of which can be calculated as:

In reality, a ship cannot sail at a fixed speed over a leg. The speed of the ship will be influenced by the conditions of the weather and sea and potential changes made by the captain. We consider the reasonable assumption that the real speed of the ship with time t on leg i of ship route r, denoted vri
                        (t), where t = 0 corresponds to the departure time from the (i − 1)th port of call, is within some range of the planned speed

                        We assume that despite the variability of the speed indicated by Eq.

It should be noted that although discounts for committing to a large contract do exist in reality, they are not very often. Shipping lines purchase bunker under contract mainly for the purpose of dealing with the same supplier, and this will ensure the quality and the availability of the bunker loaded to ships. Therefore, the “discounts” mentioned in this study are more of intangible benefits for the shipping lines. From a modeling point of view, a piecewise linear bunker cost function in Fig. 2 is more general and nests the situation of fixed bunker price at each port as a special case.

The aim of the study is to determine the planned speed

                         cannot be too small (because too many ships must be deployed) or too large (because too much bunker will be consumed). Note further that in the optimization model (5), the decision variable is a function vri
                        (t) rather than a scalar or a vector. Hence, conventional optimization approaches, such as simplex method and gradient descent, are not applicable to this problem.

The above (RBM) model can be modified to reflect the dependency of speed on the state of the shipping market. For instance, when the shipping market is booming, the freight rate is high and there are a lot of containers to transport each week. Hence, ships go faster so as to earn more income per unit time, and this has to be balanced with the additional fuel cost due to higher speeds. In particular, since the liner services are weekly, the fact that ships sail at a higher speed means fewer ships are required to provide the same routes, in other words, more routes can be operated, thus increasing the shipping capacity.

To revise (RBM), more candidate routes should be added, more containers are available and/or higher freight rates are achieved, and we should revise the objective function to maximize the profit per week, which is the revenue from shipping containers minus the total costs, including the operating costs of the ships, bunker costs, and inventory costs. Note that since the liner services are weekly, the objective function is still linear with the exception of the fuel consumption part. The fuel consumption part is convex and can be handled as shown by the paper. Finally, in a booming market, the daily charter rate of a ship is high and hence Cr
                         in the objective function should take a higher value (If the ships are not on time-charter, unused ships can be chartered out to other shipping companies to earn higher profits.).

We conduct a case study based on the Asia–Europe–Oceania network of a global liner shipping company to evaluate the applicability of the proposed models and methods. The network has a total of 46 ports, as shown in Fig. 4
                     . There are three types of ship and 11 ship routes, as shown in Tables 1
                      and 2, respectively. In the daily bunker consumption functions in Table 1
                     , the notation v means the sailing speed (knot). Seven refill ports, namely, Sokhna, Hamburg, Hong Kong, Rotterdam, Shanghai, Singapore, and Colombo are available, and their bunker price functions are the same expressed below:

                      in Eq. (29) is set at 100 for all r and i. This value is large enough that the approximation error can be negligible. Wri
                      is equal to 90 percent of the ship capacity deployed on ship route r. Unless otherwise specified, the unit inventory cost β = 0.5 and the speed variability v
                     err = 1.

We first examine the sensitivity of the solutions with the speed variability v
                        err. We change v
                        err from 0, 1,...,5. The optimal number of ships deployed in each case and the minimum total cost are shown in Fig. 5
                        . We observe that the total cost increases with the variability of speed. This result can be explained by Eq. (19): the worst-case bunker consumption increases with v
                        err and hence the total cost increases with v
                        err. Moreover, a larger v
                        err implies a higher sensitivity of the worst-case bunker consumption with the average speed. Therefore, more ships should be deployed to lower the bunker consumption when the variability of speed increases.


                        Fig. 6
                         plots the ship cost, bunker cost, and inventory cost with each value of v
                        err. It clearly shows the trade-off between ship cost, bunker cost, and inventory cost: a larger number of ships deployed imply a higher ship cost; at the same time, the speed can be lower and this leads to a lower bunker cost; nevertheless, a lower speed indicates a longer transit time, which results in a higher inventory cost. Note that the bunker cost when v
                        err = 3 is smaller than that when v
                        err = 2 because one more ship is deployed when v
                        err = 3 and the resulting average speed is lower.

We then investigate the sensitivity of the solutions with the unit inventory cost β. We change β from 0.25, 0.50,...,1.50. The optimal number of ships deployed in each case, the minimum total cost, the ship cost, bunker cost, and inventory cost are shown in Fig. 7
                        . We find that when β increases, ships have to speed up to counter the high inventory cost. As a consequence, the bunker cost increases and the number of ships decreases. Still, the inventory cost and the total cost increases dramatically. In addition, when β = 0.75, all the ships already sail at their highest speeds. Therefore, when β increases from 0.75, the ship cost and bunker cost do not change any more, and the inventory cost and the total cost increase proportionally to the increase of β.

We finally take a look at the amount of bunker purchased at each refill port, as shown in the column “Case 1” of Table 3
                        . At Hong Kong, only 65 tons of bunker is purchased every week because only ships on ship route 6 in Table 2 load bunker at Hong Kong. Ships on other ship routes that visit Hong Kong, including ship routes 2 and 11, all load bunker at Singapore, to take advantage of the price discount at Singapore. Moreover, ships on ship routes 1, 4, and 5 can only load bunker at Singapore. Therefore, the amount of bunker loaded at Singapore is very large. This result has two implications. First, in
 container liner shipping, because a ship visits many ports, it has many refueling options. Therefore, the competition between refill ports is intense, and major hubs (Singapore in this example) obtain the most revenue from bunkering services. Second, if a port is frequently visited along with a major hub, it will lose its bunkering revenue (Hong Kong in this example), unless it provides very competitive prices, as discussed below.

Suppose that Hong Kong (HK) realized that it must provide competitive prices to increase its market share, and it provides the following prices:

                        In other words, when the amount of bunker purchased is not greater than 1000 tons, the unit price at other ports is 500 USD/ton, and the price at Hong Kong is 490 USD/ton. When the amount is not greater than 2000 tons, at other ports the price is 450 USD/ton, and at Hong Kong it is 440 USD/ton. When the amount is larger than 2000 tons, at other ports the price is 420 USD/ton, and at Hong Kong it is 410 USD/ton. At first sight, the price at Hong Kong is competitive enough to guarantee that its market share will increase. Moreover, since the amount of bunker purchased at Singapore in Case 1 of Table 3 is very large (12,458 tons), if e.g. 3000 tons of the 12,458 tons of bunker changes the refill port from Singapore to Hong Kong, then at Singapore (SG) the liner shipping company still enjoys the price discount with

                        . We run the model and the result is shown in the column “Case 2” of Table 3. Surprisingly, the market share of Hong Kong does not increase. After careful examination, we identify the reason. First, ships on ship routes 1, 4, and 5 can only load bunker at Singapore and the amount of bunker loaded by ships on these three ship routes is 3224 tons, which is already greater than 2000 tons. Therefore, if ships on other ship routes load bunker at Singapore, the marginal price is 420 USD/ton. In Case 1 of Table 3, only 65 tons of bunker is purchased at Hong Kong. If ships were to load more bunker at Hong Kong, the marginal price of the first 1000 − 65 = 935 tons would be as high as 490 USD/ton, and the marginal price of the next 1000 tons would still be as high as 440 USD/ton. Hence, to attract the market share from Singapore, the shift of the amount of bunker from Singapore to Hong Kong should be at least as large as 10,480 tons, because

However, the total amount of bunker loaded by ships on ship routes 2 and 11 is only 9235 tons, which is less than 10,480 tons. Hence the shift of refill port from Singapore to Hong Kong cannot be justified.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In view of the fact that the real sailing speed of containerships may be different from the planned speed, we proposed a robust bunker management (RBM) problem that designs the optimal (planned) speed and chooses the bunkering ports and the amount of bunker to load at each refill port, so as to minimize the worst-case total cost (ship cost, bunker cost, inventory cost) considering price discounts at refill ports. A model for computing the worst-case bunker consumption on a leg with a given planned speed and a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model for the RBM problem are proposed. By exploiting the special structure of the problem, we derived the close-form expression for the worst-case bunker consumption. We subsequently developed three linearization techniques for the mixed-integer nonlinear RBM model. The proposed models are applied to a case study based on the Asia–Europe–Oceania network of a global liner shipping company. Results demonstrate that a larger variability of speed would lead to a higher total cost and more ships deployed. A larger unit inventory cost would lead to a higher total cost and fewer ships deployed. The choice of refill ports is very concentrated in liner shipping because a ship visits many ports and refill ports provide price discounts. Moreover, due to the structure of the liner shipping network, a lower price at a refill port does not necessarily mean an increase of the market share.

This study has assumed that the bunker prices are known. To consider the uncertainty caused by the fluctuations of bunker prices, we can use stochastic optimization approaches to minimize the expected total cost while treating the bunker prices are random variables. Moreover, how to design the optimal bunker hedging plan to control the risk in bunker management is a worthwhile research topic.
