                  Although numerous chemicals have been identified to have significant toxicological effect on aquatic organisms, there is still lack of a reliable, high-throughput approach to evaluate, screen and monitor the presence of organic contaminants in aquatic system. In the current study, we proposed a synthetic pipeline to automatically model and predict the acute toxicity of chemicals to algae. In the procedure, a new alignment-free three dimensional (3D) structure characterization method was described and, with this method, several 3D-quantitative structure–toxicity relationship (3D-QSTR) models were developed, from which two were found to exhibit strong internal fitting ability and high external predictive power. The best model was established by Gaussian process (GP), which was further employed to perform extrapolation on a random compound library consisting of 1014 virtually generated substituted benzenes. It was found that (i) substitution number can only exert slight influence on chemical׳s toxicity, but low-substituted benzenes seem to have higher toxicity than those of high-substituted entities, and (ii) benzenes substituted by nitro group and halogens exhibit high acute toxicity as compared to other substituents such as methyl and carboxyl groups. Subsequently, several promising candidates suggested by computational prediction were assayed by using a standard algal growth inhibition test. Consequently, four substituted benzenes, namely 2,3-dinitrophenol, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, 1,2,3-trinitrobenzene and 3-bromophenol, were determined to have high acute toxicity to Scenedesmus obliquus, with their EC50 values of 2.5±0.8, 10.5±2.1, 1.4±0.2 and 42.7±5.4μmol/L, respectively.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Algae are a polyphyletic and paraphyletic group of organisms that occur in most habitats and usually found in damp places or bodies of aquatic environments [1]. Diverse compounds have been reported to exhibit acute toxicity on algae [2]. However, it is too time-consuming and expensive to systematically conduct experimental assay on all existing and potential chemicals for their toxicity. Therefore, an important aspect of modern toxicology research is the prediction of toxicity of compounds from their molecular structure using quantitative structure–toxicity relationship (QSTR) approach [3,4]. Recently, a number of QSTR studies have been successfully performed to investigate the structural basis and molecular properties underlying compound toxicity to algae [5–9]. For example, Lu et al. developed a series of simple linear correlations between the molecular structure and acute toxicity of aromatic compounds using quantum chemical parameters and physicochemical features [10–12]; these correlation models were later extended to the joint toxicity of substituted phenols and anilines to algae [13–15]. Despite these successful cases, above works can only be regarded as preliminary QSTR studies on acute toxicity to algae owing to their small data size and simple regression method. In this respect, Lessigiarska et al. organized a large compound set to investigate fish, algae and Daphnia toxicity [16]. Recently, Gramatica and co-workers performed a case study of toxicity of (benzo)triazoles to the algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and suggested that a satisfactory QSTR model can only be built from elaborate selection of structural descriptor, regression method and data set [17].

In the current study, we first collected hundreds of organic contaminants and environmental pollutants and their acute toxicity to a variety of algae to define a distinct data set. Second, a new three-dimensional QSTR (3D-QSTR) methodology was developed to characterize the structural and nonbonded profile of organic molecules. Third, seven machine learning methods, including three linear and four nonlinear, were employed to correlate the generated descriptors with compound toxicity based on the collected data set. Forth, the acute toxicities of several promising candidates were evaluated in vitro using a standard algae inhibition test. In this way, we expect to obtain an optimized, general-purpose 3D-QSTR model that is able to carry out high-throughput screening of vast chemical space to determine potential toxicity for aquatic organisms.

A total of 873 organic contaminants with known acute toxicities to algae were compiled from a number of literatures [10–29] and publicly available sources. These compounds include diverse industrial chemicals and environmental pollutants such as nitroaromatics, phenols, anilines, triazoles and substituted benzenes, and their toxicity was experimentally determined as 50% effective inhibition concentration (EC50) for a variety of algae species such as Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlorella pyrenoidosa and P. subcapitata in 48 or 72h. Here, the EC50 values were converted to negative logarithm form (pEC50) for subsequent analysis. The 873 chemicals as well as their acute toxicity data are tabulated in Supporting Information Table S1.

In a high-profile article Golbraikh and Tropsha pointed out that internal validation appears to be the necessary but not the sufficient condition for a statistical regression model to have high predictive power, and they emphasized that the external validation is the only way to establish reliable model [30]. Therefore, we randomly split the data set into two parts with the ratio of ~3:1; the large part consisted of 655 compounds was used as internal training set to develop QSTR models, and the small part contained 218 samples and was served as external test set to blindly validate the developed models.

Previously, quantum chemical descriptors (e.g. the energies of the highest and lowest occupied molecular orbital) and physicochemical descriptors (e.g. dipole moment and hydrophobicity) have been widely used to perform QSTR modeling of compound toxicity to algae [10,11]. The drawback of these 2D descriptors is that they are incapable of capturing molecular 3D structure information. Currently, the most widely applied 3D-QSAR methodology is the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) [31]. However, CoMFA can only be applied to the cases where all investigated molecules share a common sketch to facilitate alignment manipulation. To solve this issue, we herein used a new 3D molecular structure characterization method that is free of the alignment manipulation step.

Organic molecules are commonly composed of atoms H, C, N, P, O, S, F, Cl, Br and I; they can be categorized into five classes in terms of their chemical attribute, that is, class I: H, class II: C, class III: N and P, class IV: O and S, and class V: F, Cl, Br and I. All the 15 possible combinations among the five classes of atoms are represented in 
                        Table 1. For example, the combination of classes III with IV includes four atom pairs N–O, N–S, P–O and P–S. Subsequently, three nonbonded interaction potentials that dominate biomolecular recognition, i.e. electrostatic, steric and hydrophobic, were calculated for all atom pairs in an organic molecule, and the resulting values were assigned into the 15 combinations. In this way, the nonbonded interaction profile of an organic molecule can be characterized using at most 45 nonbonded descriptors; the first, secondary and third 15 descriptors represent, respectively, electrostatic, steric and hydrophobic potentials for the 15 combinations of five atomic classes in an organic molecule.

The electrostatic, steric and hydrophobic interaction potentials between two atoms i and j in a molecule can be calculated using, respectively, Coulomb׳s law

Here, chlorobenzene was used as an example to illustrate the process of generating molecular descriptors. As shown in 
                        Fig. 1, the 2D molecular structure of chlorobenzene was automatically converted to 3D conformation using CORINA program [37], and the coarse-grained 3D conformation was then minimized with the MM2 force field [38] to achieve its energetic minimum. Subsequently, the electrostatic, steric and hydrophobic potentials were calculated for the chlorobenzene based on its minimized 3D structure. The chlorobenzene contains five hydrogen atoms, six carbon atoms and a chlorine atom, corresponding to classes I, II and V, respectively. The combination of classes I, II and V presents six possibilities, that is, I–I, I–II, I–V, II–II, II–V and V–V. Here, the chlorobenzene is unable to define the V–V combination since it has only one atom (chlorine atom) belonging to the class V. Therefore, five descriptors were finally generated for each nonbonded term, totally resulting in 15 non-zero nonbonded descriptors for the chlorobenzene molecule.

Seven sophisticated machine learning methods, including three linear and four nonlinear methods, namely, multivariable linear regression (MLR) [39], partial least squares (PLS) regression [40], back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) [41], support vector machine (SVM) [42], least square-support vector machine (LSSVM) [43], random forest (RF) [44] and Gaussian process (GP) [45,46], were employed here to perform statistical modeling. Here, a coarse-grained grid-searching scheme using root-mean-square error of cross-validation as the objective function was carried out to determine the optimum combination of model parameters.

Matlab toolboxes of ChemoAC_MLR, ChemoAC_PLS, NNET, SVMKM, LSSVMlab, RFTX and GPML were used to implement MLR, PLS, BPANN, SVM, LSSVM, RF and GP modeling, respectively.

The tested compounds, including one substituted benzene, one substituted aniline and two substituted phenols, were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., China (analytical reagent grade). The algal strain S. obliquus was used to perform the inhibition test that was conducted according to the OECD guidelines for the testing of chemicals. The culture was maintained in a liquid medium, prepared as described in Lu et al. [10]. In logarithmic growing period, the algae were incubated with the tested compound under a continuous light for 48h. The initial alga concentration in the culture is about 2×104 cells/ml. Algal growth was monitored using electron microscope.

Data were handled according to Chao et al. [50] Briefly, the equation μ=ln(N
                        
                           t
                        /N
                        0)/48 was used, where μ is the algal average growth rate, and N
                        0 and N
                        
                           t
                         are the initial cell concentration and the cell concentration after being cultured for 48h, respectively. The inhibition rate was calculated as I=(μ
                        
                           b

                           t
                        )/μ
                        
                           b
                        ×100%, where μ

                           t
                         are the algal average growth rate of the control and that under exposure of compounds, respectively. The EC50 values were determined through one variable linear regression analysis of compound concentrations and the inhibition rates as the relative toxic potency for each single chemical.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Previously, by examining in vivo fish acute toxicity data retrieving from the ECOTOX database Hrovat et al. found a significant variability for the toxicity test results; they also pointed out that the variability is difficult to be addressed reliably since a majority of data sources do not give rigorous control of data entries ensuring complete recording of testing conditions [51]. Here, in order to develop general-purpose QSTR models a large data set that contains structurally diverse compounds was compiled from different sources. However, almost all of these data sources only provide a single data point for a specific compound. Thus, we cannot evaluate the effect of data variability on the QSTR modeling results. Even so, most data used in this study take a geometric mean over repeated tests. In this way, the negative effect of data variability on QSTR modeling could be eliminated largely.

We used the newly developed 3D structure characterization method to parameterize the nonbonded profile of the 873 collected organic compounds. This group of compounds contains atomic types belonging to all the five classes, and therefore the characterization can totally result in 45 nonbonded descriptors, albeit a number of these descriptor terms may be zero for some molecules. Subsequently, we employed the seven machine learning methods to build 3D-QSTR models based on 655 training samples. In addition, considering that Golbraikh and Tropsha emphasized the importance of external validation in determining the reliability and predictive power of regression models [30], we further used the 218 test samples to blindly validate the seven 3D-QSTR models developed using different machine learning methods. The resulting statistics and plots of predicted against experimental values are listed in 
                        Table 2 and shown in 
                        Fig. 2, respectively.

As can be seen, the seven methods have a similar fitting ability on training set, although the nonlinear methods seem to perform slightly better than those linear ones. By visually examining scatter plots in Fig. 2, it is seen that the linear and nonlinear models exhibited different scatter profiles; the distributions of sample points generated from the two classical linear methods, i.e. MLR and PLS, are deviated obviously from the linear state and presents a crescent-shape profile, where the pEC50 values of low- and high-toxicity compounds are overestimated considerably by the models. A similar phenomenon can also be observed in the non-classical linear LSSVM model, implying that some nonlinear components may exist in the algae toxicity system. Even though, the linear dependence is thought to dominate the system, if considering that the three linear methods can also achieve a satisfactory result in fitting through the sample space (r
                        
                           f
                        
                        2>0.79).

For the other four nonlinear methods, the BPANN possesses high fitting ability on training set but low predictive power on test set (r
                        
                           f
                        
                        2=0.927 versus r
                        
                           p
                        
                        2=0.645). The wide difference of BPANN model working on training and test sets implies a strong overfitting involved in the model. It is known that neural network is a powerful learning tool that is, in theory, capable of mimicking any nonlinear relationship. However, the strong fitting ability makes BPANN also efficient in learning random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship, leading to the overfitting phenomenon. In addition, although the RF performed much well on training set (r
                        
                           f
                        
                        2=0.827), its cross-validation and external prediction are moderate (r
                        
                           c
                        
                        2=0.772 and r
                        
                           p
                        
                        2=0.763). As a bootstrapping method, RF can also engage out-of-bag (OOB) samples as a built-in testing to validate the modeling process. The predicted results for OOB samples are acceptable (r
                        
                           b
                        
                        2=0.784), which is close to cross-validation r
                        
                           c
                        
                        2.

The best regression models were constructed using SVM and GP; both the two methods displayed strong fitting ability (r
                        
                           f
                        
                        2=0.854 and 0.872, respectively) for training samples and high predictive power for test samples (r
                        
                           p
                        
                        2=0.806 and 0.817, respectively). As can be seen from Fig. 2D and G, all the sample points are evenly distributed around the slopes fitting through the sample spaces, and no obvious outliers can be found in the two plots, suggesting that the SVM and GP can model the compound toxicity system satisfactorily. It is known that SVM has been widely used in chemical and biological communities to treat complex nonlinear problems, and recently this method was successfully employed to predict the dynamic change of algae population in freshwater [52] and to identify algae species based on multi-feature integration [53]. The GP is a newly emerged machine method that combined constant term, linear term, squared exponential term and noise term in covariance function, and thus particularly suitable for treating the current linear and nonlinear-hybrid problem [54].

Aromatic compounds are widely distributed and relocated in the environment as a result of the incomplete combustion of organic matter, which is also one of the most important sources to water pollution. Substituted benzenes are the simplest aromatic compounds that have been observed to cause severe acute toxicity to diverse algal species. Here, 14 small chemical groups that have been widely found in aromatic environmental pollutants were used as substituents to define a random substituted benzene library that contains 1014 benzene derivatives, that is, 200 randomly generated compounds for each di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-substituted benzenes as well as all the 14 mono-substituted benzenes (
                        Fig. 3).

Considering that, in all the seven machine learning methods, GP possesses satisfactory fitting ability on training set (r
                        
                           f
                        
                        2=0.872) and highest predictive power (r
                        
                           p
                        
                        2=0.817) on test set, we herein employed the GP model to perform extrapolation on the 1014 substituted benzene compounds to determine their theoretical pEC50 values. In the 1014 random compounds, the algal toxicities of 12 molecules have been reported previously [10–13], which are a subset of the 873 organic contaminants. In the 12 molecules, 3 samples (1-nitro-3-chlorobenzene, 3-nitrophenol and aniline) were assigned into test set so that they were not used to develop the GP model. The plot of GP-calculated pEC50 against experimentally measured values for the 12 substituted benzenes is shown in 
                        Fig. 4A. As might be expected, a good consistence can be observed between the theoretical and experimental toxicities over the 12 samples, with a high correlation r
                        
                           p
                        
                        2=0.847, indicating that the model is indeed applicable to the virtual substituted benzene library. The slope of line fitting through the 12 sample points is 0.88 close to the expected value 1, suggesting only a slight systematic error existed in the GP model system. The systematic error may be caused by insufficient characterization of molecular structures and/or improper description of structure–toxicity relationship.

From Fig. 4B it is evident that the theoretical pEC50 distribution of the 1014 compounds exhibits a typical unimodality, in which most samples (~70%) have low or moderate toxicity with respect to their theoretical pEC50<4.0. However, there are a few compounds (~5%) that fall into the region representing the particularly high toxicity (pEC50>6.0), suggesting that only a fraction of substituted benzenes can cause severe acute toxicity to algae and other aquatic organisms, and these high-toxicity compounds are considered as the major aromatic source of water pollutants.

Further, we examined the dependences of toxicity on the number of substituted positions and on the type of substituents. As can be seen from Fig. 4C, the substitution number can only exert slight influence on compound toxicity, but low-substituted compounds (substitution number=1, 2 or 3) seem to have higher toxicity than those of high-substituted entities (substitution number=4, 5 or 6). This is expected because as compared to high-substituted benzenes the low-substituted ones possess larger lipophilicity and stronger transmembrane capability, thus leading to high toxicity on algal cells. In addition, the substituent type appears to have more significant effect on the acute toxicity of substituted benzenes; in the 14 substituents the nitro-, chloro- and bromo-groups show highest toxicity to algae Fig. 4D. In fact, the halogenated benzenes and nitrobenzenes have long been reported to exhibit strong acute toxicity to a variety of aquatic organisms [55,56]; they represent a typical class of water pollutants. A further 2-tailed student׳s t-test also confirmed this point. As expected, the substitution number does not have substantially effect on acute toxicity, as the p-values of most substitution number pairs are insignificant (>0.05). In contrast, the substituent type exhibits a noticeable relationship with the acute toxicity, that is, a large proportion of substituent type pairs possess small p-values (<0.05) and most of them are particularly significant (<0.01).

In the random substituted benzene library, the 10 compounds listed in 
                        Table 3 were predicted to have highest theoretical toxicities (top-10). As can be seen, all these compounds are either nitro-substituted or halogenated, and their substitution numbers range from 2 to 4. In fact, nitrobenzenes dominate the high toxicity pool; eight compounds are substituted by at least one nitro group. Subsequently, four out of the top-10 compounds were purchased and assayed for their acute toxicities to the alga S. obliquus, including 2,3-dinitrophenol, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, 1,2,3-trinitrobenzene and 3-bromophenol. As a result, the pEC50 values of the four substituted benzenes were measured to be 5.60, 4.98, 5.84 and 4.37 (EC50=2.5±0.8, 10.5±2.1, 1.4±0.2 and 42.7±5.4μmol/L), respectively. It is satisfactory as they showed moderate or high toxicity toward the algae, although the pEC50 values of all the tested compounds were overestimated by the GP model. The 1,2,3-trinitrobenzene was determined to have strongest toxicity (pEC50=5.84). This is expected if considering that its analogs 1,2-dinitrobenzene, 1,3-dinitrobenzene and 1,4-dinitrobenzene were also reported as high-toxicity compounds (pEC50=5.04, 4.85 and 4.96, respectively [10,11]).

There are a number of publications regarding the applicability domain (AD) of statistical regression models in predicting query chemicals [57–61]. The Setubal Workshop report provides conceptual guidance on defining the applicability domain (AD) of a QSAR model. It states that “the AD of a QSAR is the physico-chemical, structural, or biological space, knowledge or information on which the training set of the model has been developed, and for which it is applicable to make predictions for new compounds. The AD of a QSAR should be described in terms of the most relevant parameters i.e. usually those that are descriptors of the model. Ideally, the QSAR should only be used to make predictions within that domain by interpolation not extrapolation” [62].

In order to expand the AD of built QSTR models, this study employed a large data set containing various structurally diverse chemicals with determined acute toxicity data to train the models. In addition, the built models will used to perform extrapolation on 1024 substituted benzenes; this kind of compounds have been tested extensively in previous works so that our data set contains many similar chemicals, which should make the AD of the models covering the substituted benzenes. Here, we carried out principal component analysis (PCA) to examine whether the structural properties of the 1024 substituted benzenes are fallen within the chemical space of the 873 training samples. The PCA was performed on the multivariate nonbonded descriptors for separately the 873 training chemicals and the 1024 extrapolated substituted benzenes. These data points were then mapped into the first two-principal component space to visualize the overlapping between the training chemicals and the extrapolated substituted benzenes. As can be seen from 
                        Fig. 5, the distribution of sample points representing the 1024 substituted benzenes is evidently within the training chemical space; no obvious outliers can be found in the extrapolated compounds. Overall, we can conclude that (i) the QSTR models possess a relatively large AD since the they were trained by a large data set with structurally diverse chemicals, and (ii) those extrapolated substituted benzenes are covered well by the AD if considering that many structurally similar compounds were included in the training set to develop the models.

In addition, the biological variability is considered as the natural variability in a lab parameter due to physiologic differences among subjects and within the same subject over time. In the current study, we primarily aimed at the development of a general-purpose predictor to monitor algal acute toxicity of various potential organic contaminants; in order to achieve this we collected a compound data pool as large as possible. In this way, no multiple data are available for most compound samples, and some data may involve strong noise and uncertainty. Therefore, we herein are unable to evaluate biological variability with the current data. However, the biological variability would not cause an essential influence on the built 3DQSTR models and the conclusions obtained from this study if considering a sufficiently large data pool used here to perform the statistical modeling.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Nonbonded interactions are known to dominate various molecular behaviors such as recognition and interaction [63,64]. A new alignment-free 3D-QSTR method was proposed in this study to characterize the nonbonded interaction profile of organic molecules, which was then employed to parameterize the molecular structure properties of hundreds of organic contaminants retrieved from various literatures and publicly available source. The obtained structural descriptors were correlated with experimental acute toxicities of these contaminants to diverse algae species by using seven machine learning methods. Two nonlinear models built using SVM and GP showed both high fitting ability and strong predictive power. Subsequently, the best GP model was employed to screen a virtual compound pool that contains 1024 randomly generated substituted benzenes. As a result, ten compounds were identified as promising candidates that may cause severe acute toxicity to algae, from which four compounds were assayed to confirm their significant toxic effect on the algal species S. obliquus.
