                  This paper seeks to determine how the double marginalization phenomenon affects the tradeoff between polluting emissions and abatement activities related to pollution accumulation in a supply chain composed of one manufacturer and one retailer. The environmental consequence of this inefficiency, which emerges in a non-cooperative vertical setting governed by a single-parameter contract, is overlooked in the literature on pollution control. In the setup of a two-stage game, we investigate the impact of double marginalization for non-cooperative equilibrium. To check whether there are differences between dynamic and strategic effects of double marginalization on pollution accumulation, both the open-loop and feedback Nash equilibria are derived over a finite time horizon, with the cooperative solution as a benchmark.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The environmental economics literature has dealt extensively with the horizontal impact of decentralized decision-making on pollution accumulation, which consists in improper internalization of the social cost of pollution by firms or nations (for recent surveys, see Benchekroun & Long, 2011; Jørgensen, Martín-Herrán, & Zaccour, 2010; Long, 2010). Accordingly, strategy types (Dockner, Jørgensen, Van Long, & Sorger, 2000) in pollution dynamic game models are strongly influential in that commitment (that is, open-loop Nash equilibrium) strategies result in a lower steady state pollution stock than contingent (or feedback Nash equilibrium) strategies do.

In contrast, the vertical impact of decentralized decision-making in a bilateral monopoly (supply chain) on pollution accumulation has been under-investigated in both the economics and management literatures. It is well-known that poor supply chain coordination creates a common inefficiency: the double marginalization effect is maximized under conventional wholesale price contracts (Spengler, 1950). Accordingly, retailers pay suppliers a fixed transfer price per unit ordered, and mark-ups applied by both firms increase consumer prices, lower consumer demand, and reduce overall profits compared with centralized decision-making (Bresnahan & Reiss, 1985).

Because double marginalization decreases both channel profit and consumer surplus, it should be eliminated from the supply chain. Supply chain coordination has been advocated and can be induced via mechanisms like contracts (e.g., El Ouardighi, 2014; Hu, Caldentey, & Vulcano, 2013).

How does double marginalization affect pollution accumulation in a supply chain? The general perception is that greater collaboration and integration within a supply chain would also enhance firms’ environmental practices (Handfield, Walton, Seegers, & Melnyk, 1997; Hollos, Blome, & Foerstl, 2012; Klassen & Vachon, 2003; Lee, 2010; Simpson, 2010). Thus, compared with a non-cooperative supply chain, the mitigation of double marginalization in a cooperative supply chain intensifies greater abatement efforts by eliminating the underinvestment problem in a decentralized context. However, considering that mitigating double marginalization ultimately increases consumer demand and thus the absolute volume of pollution emissions as a by-product of production activities, it is unclear whether the increase in abatement efforts in a cooperative supply chain driven by the increase in revenues would far outweigh the increase in emission volumes. Put differently, double marginalization purportedly lowers the pollution stock due to lower consumer demand, yet because the underinvestment problem typically occurs in a decentralized context, the decentralized supply chain with double marginalization putatively expends less effort on pollution abatement. Therefore, the tradeoff between emissions and abatement is not straightforward.

A primary goal in this paper is to determine how double marginalization affects the tradeoff between polluting emissions and abatement efforts related to pollution accumulation in a supply chain. In particular, we investigate whether the virtue of supply chain coordination would be still valid from an environmental standpoint. Given the increasing importance of environmental sustainability and the traditional emphasis on supply chain coordination, this linkage deserves thorough examination. Should regulators encourage supply chain coordination to enhance environmental performance and social welfare? What would an optimal abatement strategy be for profit maximizing firms, along with optimal emissions in a cooperative or non-cooperative supply chain? Although the impact of double marginalization has been widely discussed in the literature, little research has addressed these issues simultaneously. To fill this gap and to respond to Tang and Zhou's (2012) call for future research on vertical interactions between supply chain members in the context of environmentally/socially sustainable operations, we address the following research questions:

                        
                           -
                           What is the impact of double marginalization in a supply chain from the environmental perspective, specifically on the tradeoff between emissions and abatement decisions?

From a broader perspective that considers social welfare and cumulative pollution, is the centralized supply chain more beneficial than the decentralized chain?

To investigate this issue, we use a non-cooperative two-stage game model of a simple supply chain with one manufacturer that sells a finished good to one retailer, which resells it to a final consumer. As a key component of the problem, pollution is interpreted as a stock variable in which pollutants would be generated per unit output as a by-product of the production process. However, it is reduced by the firm's abatement efforts throughout the planning horizon. Production is determined by price-dependent consumer demand: a make-to-order system is assumed in this paper. We analyze the supply chain's pricing and abatement effort decisions under a wholesale price contract. In this setup, the optimal transfer price is determined at the first stage of the game by the manufacturer, which presumably maximizes its best interest. The optimal contract can be reached by both firms if their resulting payoffs are positive. Due to the cumulative nature of pollution, a differential game of finite duration is played during the second stage of the game. To investigate optimal strategies and their dynamic effects on the environment, a differential game is often adopted in environment-related studies (e.g., Bertinelli, Camacho, & Zou, 2014; Boucekkine, Krawczyk, & Vallée, 2011; Chen & Sheu, 2009; for a review, see Jørgensen et al., 2010). Jørgensen et al. (2010) also explained that a differential game approach is particularly useful to model environmental issues that are intrinsically dynamic and influenced by interactions between firms over time, not just one-shot phenomena. To check whether there are differences between dynamic and strategic effects of double marginalization on pollution accumulation, both the open-loop and feedback Nash equilibria are derived over finite time horizons, with the cooperative solution as a benchmark.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 develops the game model. Sections 4–6 present the cooperative, open-loop and feedback Nash equilibrium strategies, respectively. In Section 7, we compare the results. Section 8 provides numerical illustrations. Section 9 concludes the paper.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Most of the research on the environment investigates how a single firm or regulator manages pollution or environment-related issues. It includes studies on the problem of emission technology selection in response to environmental policies (Krass, Nedorezov, & Ovchinnikov, 2013), the optimal pollution abatement effort or emission banking strategy with production-inventory dynamics (Li, 2013), and optimal environmental policies (Jung, Krutilla, & Boyd, 1996; Milliman & Prince, 1989). Extending these studies, the impact of horizontal interactions on the environment has been widely explored. In a horizontal context, interactions between firms’ or countries’ polluting emissions are often investigated (Bertinelli et al., 2014; Boucekkine et al., 2011). Subramanian, Gupta, and Talbot (2007) examined firms’ production, bidding and emissions abatement strategy when firms compete for scarce emission permits, or even for customer demand. Atasu, Van Wassenhove, and Sarvary (2009) studied economic and environmental impacts of take-back legislation when manufacturers engage in Cournot competition. Using a differential game, Chen and Sheu (2009) found that regulation standards should be gradually raised to enhance product recyclability and promote Extended Product Responsibility of firms competing for sales. Bagnoli and Watts (2003) examined firms’ competition for socially responsible consumers and found that a less competitive market promotes more eco-friendly activities by firms.

In a vertical context, however, the impact of double marginalization on environmental performance remains largely underexplored. Recently, a few studies investigated the impact of diverse contract schemes for environment-related issues in a supply chain or examined firms’ environmental decision-making in a supply chain network. For instance, De Giovanni (2014) investigated environmental collaboration between a manufacturer and a retailer in a closed-loop remanufacturing supply chain by implementing a reverse revenue sharing contract. Zhang, Wang, and You (2015) examined how consumer environmental awareness influences order quantity decisions for environmental and traditional products and the economic performance of supply chain members. They also investigated how a return contract coordinates a supply chain, assuming that the level of environmental quality is exogenously given. Cruz (2008) explored product flows, prices, and social responsibility activities (e.g., activities for environmental preservation or quality assurance) in a supply chain network consisting of multiple manufacturers, retailers and consumers, when each entity engages in multi-criteria decision-making behaviors such as profit maximization and minimization of emission and risk. Chung, Weaver, and Friesz (2013) studied how supply chain network members decide on outsourcing, shipment, distribution, emissions or pollution mitigation in response to environmental taxes. They found that taxes on the pollution stock should be carefully designed given the game structure.

Although these studies shed light on environmental issues in a supply chain, in-depth research into how double marginalization in a supply chain influences pollution dynamics is lacking. When supply chain centralization is considered in the environmental context, the commonly accepted view is that greater collaboration and integration within a supply chain enhances environmental performance (Handfield et al., 1997; Hollos et al., 2012; Klassen & Vachon, 2003; Lee, 2010; Simpson, 2010). However, given the motivation of profit-maximization, little is understood about how firms in a centralized or decentralized supply chain actually behave regarding the trade-off between pollution abatement decisions and pollution emission, and how firms’ behavior influences environmental performance and firms’ profits and consumer surplus throughout the time horizon.

We consider a supply chain with one manufacturer (upward firm) and one retailer (downward firm) involved in a make-to-order system where no firm can carry an inventory. We assume that the manufacturer and retailer first agree on a wholesale price contract, and supply consumer demand over a finite time horizon. Consumer demand is assumed to depend negatively on price. At the first stage of the game, the manufacturer sets the optimal transfer price that prevails throughout the game. In the second stage, consumer demand generates polluting emissions that accumulate over time. Specifically, pollutants are generated per unit of output as a byproduct of the manufacturer's production. We assume that each unit of good produced and sold results in one unit of emitted pollutant.

Production activities of manufacturing firms are major sources of pollution, and pollution emissions are a by-product of manufacturing processes (Klassen & Whybark, 1999; Krass et al., 2013; Piot-Lepetit, 2014). The United States Department of State (2010) reports that manufacturing accounts for approximately four-fifths of total energy use in the industrial sector resulting in CO2 emissions. Emissions from industrial processes such as production activities and transformation of raw materials ranked third highest, followed by emissions from the energy and agriculture sector. Chung et al. (2013), examining a supply chain network with multiple manufacturers and retailers, also assumed that the costs associated with pollution stock and pollution abatement effort are incurred only by manufacturers, not retailers. They identified two sources of pollutants at the manufacturer stage; one related to the use of specific production inputs and the other to manufacturing operations and production of goods. We therefore assume that the pollution stock entails a cost incurred by the manufacturer only
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        We also examined the assumption that both the manufacturer and the retailer emit pollutants and found that our major findings still hold qualitatively under this assumption.
                     .

To reduce the pollution stock and related costs, the manufacturer can invest in abatement efforts (e.g., Fowlie, 2010). Given thermodynamic restrictions on the extent to which emissions can be reduced, abatement efforts should be bounded to account for partial reduction of emissions. We assume that the manufacturer's production process and abatement operations are mutually independent so that the abatement effort is non-proportional to the output.

The environmental absorption capacity of pollution is approximated by zero. This approximation is consistent with recent empirical observations that terrestrial and oceanic natural pollution sinks are becoming much less efficient (Canadell et al., 2007; Le Quéré et al., 2007) and will either become saturated or turn into a pollution source after 2050 (e.g., Cox, Betts, Jones, Spall, & Totterdell, 2000; Piao et al., 2008; Zhao & Running, 2010). These trends suggest that our approximation of a zero environmental absorption capacity of pollution describes the current situation more accurately than standard assumptions based on linear or non-linear environmental absorption capacity of pollution (for a review, see El Ouardighi, Benchekroun, & Grass, 2014). In practical terms, the supply chain cannot benefit from a natural abatement of the pollution stock. As an economic counterpart of such absence of environmental subsidy, the initial pollution stock is normalized to zero to account for the specific part of the supply chain in the pollution accumulation process and thus determine a proper economic imputation of the manufacturer's corresponding pollution cost.

                      Price-dependent linear demand is one of the most commonly used demand specifications (Krishnamoorthy, Prasad, & Sethi, 2010), long used in the economic and management literature as a basic demand function to investigate a problem of double marginalization and vertical coordination (e.g., Bresnahan & Reiss, 1985; Carr & Karmarkar, 2005; Cui, Raju, & Zhang, 2007; Dellarocas, 2012; Mishra, Raghunathan, & Yue, 2009). It is also commonly applied in environment-related studies (e.g., Krass et al., 2013; Majumder & Groenevelt, 2001).

Each firm's objective is to maximize its cumulative profits over the planning period. We assume a fixed and finite planning horizon, T < ∞, and omit the discounting of future profits.

                     1 > 0 is the (constant) transfer price to the retailer, and c ≥ 0 is the manufacturer's unit production cost. For simplicity, c is normalized to zero, without loss of generality.

The negative externalities of the pollution stock are valued as an increasing convex cost function of pollution, that is, fy(t
                     )
                     2/2, where f > 0 is the cost coefficient associated with the manufacturer's pollution. This quadratic form of cost associated with the pollution stock is commonly accepted in the literature on pollution control (e.g., Bertinelli et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2013; El Ouardighi et al., 2014; Li, 2014; Michel & Rotillon, 1995). It is also of practical relevance because manufacturers producing high pollution face pressures not only from the institutional environment (e.g., taxes or fines imposed by regulators, protests from environmental groups) but also from shareholders. A quadratic pollution cost function means that the damages due to the pollution stock entail a social cost that increases more than proportionally with the pollution stock. In practice, it is often difficult to assess exhaustively the social cost of pollution damages that should be imposed to polluters. Nevertheless, the current trend for regulators is to include in the social cost of pollution —though approximately— damages like rising sea levels, the increased number of Katrina-level hurricanes or sustained droughts (Wald, 2013). Recently, six companies in China were imposed fines which amount to 26 million dollars in total for their accumulated pollution (Wong, 2014). The fine was the biggest of any Chinese environmental pollution case, signaling that the agencies in China regard the pollution as a top concern. On the other hand, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) works with hundreds of institutional investors along with governments and international institutions (e.g., UN and EU) to disclose the greenhouse gas emissions of major companies. CDP disclosed emission performance of over 4,500 companies in 2013 and specifically identified ‘high emitting’ companies in each industry sector. Because investors are often averse to long-term investment risks, they might avoid companies with low environmental performance. Klassen and McLaughlin (1996) also found a link between firms’ environmental crises and major negative stock returns. They explained that firms with weak environmental performance might incur environmental spills, crises and liabilities, triggering negative market reactions. Therefore, firms with huge emissions are often imposed a tremendous cost from the damage of reputation and from the loss in stock value that far exceeds the environmental taxes (Hamilton, 1995; Pierce, 1998).

Finally, we suppose that that abatement efforts are subject to diminishing returns and that their cost is an increasing quadratic function for the manufacturer, that is, ev(t
                     )
                     2/2, where e > 0 is the cost coefficient associated with the manufacturer’ investment in pollution abatement. It encompasses resources (e.g., capital, human resource, time) a manufacturer needs to introduce and operate environment-friendly technology/facility/equipment, innovate in operating processes, train employees, and set up superior management systems/infrastructure for emission reduction. The literature often assumes that investment in pollution abatement has a rising marginal cost, that is, reducing additional pollution becomes increasingly difficult due to the need for more advanced technology or more costly investment (Bertinelli et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2013; Liu, Anderson, & Cruz, 2012; Ni, Li, & Tang, 2010). For simplicity, we assume that 
                        
                           e
                           =
                           1
                        
                     , without loss of generality; that is, the cost coefficient of pollution abatement (e) is normalized to one. A similar assumption is made in Bertinelli et al. (2014). It implies that f, the cost coefficient associated with the pollution stock, could be interpreted relative to e, the cost coefficient of the pollution abatement effort.

                      summarizes the parameters and variables of the model.

A particular feature of the game (1)–(3) is that the manufacturer's problem is linear-quadratic and the retailer's problem has the linear-state property. This feature makes it difficult to predict whether the strategy types (open-loop and feedback Nash equilibrium strategies) will have different outcomes. Therefore, both strategy types are analyzed.

This section analyzes the cooperative setting where the manufacturer and the retailer centralize their decisions to maximize their joint profits, as in the case of vertical integration.

Skipping the time index for convenience, the cooperative objective criterion is:

                     , the manufacturer's and retailer's OLNE payoff are both positive. Therefore, the wholesale price contract is agreeable for both firms.□

If information on pollution stock is available to both firms throughout the game, they can condition their actions on the current value of this stock, and on time. In this case, a standard approach is to look for a feedback Nash equilibrium (FBNE). We use the superscript of "fb" to denote the equilibrium strategies in the open-loop Nash setting.

                     Proposition 1 implies that manufacturer's abatement effort is greater in a cooperative case than in a non-cooperative case if the effectiveness of the abatement effort is sufficiently large or demand sensitivity to price is weak. In a more profitable context, firms can more easily invest in abatement efforts. This is why the cooperative supply chain participates in the pollution abatement more actively than in the non-cooperative case. In the opposite context, the non-cooperative supply chain might heighten the manufacturer's abatement effort, which increases environmental virtue.□

This means that consumer demand in a cooperative case is greater than in a non-cooperative case throughout the planning horizon if the manufacturer's effectiveness of abatement effort is great enough to avoid an excessively high pollution cost. It follows that polluting emissions may be lower during an initial time interval and higher over the subsequent time interval in the cooperative case than in the non-cooperative case.□

Hence, the cooperative case generates a greater pollution stock than the non-cooperative case. Although an increase in revenues driven by mitigation of double marginalization in a cooperative supply chain may result in greater abatement efforts, the efforts do not outweigh the increase in emissions and thus lower the pollution stock. In other words, a cooperative supply chain might choose to sacrifice environmental performance rather than increase abatement effort. In a non-cooperative supply chain, there is a lesser burden of abatement effort due to relatively small polluting emissions.□

In a cooperative game, more efforts are generally allocated to pollution abatement because the supply chain's costs and revenues are both affected, while only the manufacturer's costs and revenues are affected in a non-cooperative game. However, an increase in abatement efforts is less beneficial to a cooperative supply chain if its marginal ability to reduce pollution is low and there is little room to raise the consumer price due to high price sensitivity of demand. Therefore, greater initial abatement efforts (while the pollution stock is still relatively low) would raise the consumer price, which would reduce demand.

From (12) and (24), the cumulative abatement efforts for the entire planning horizon in the cooperative and non-cooperative cases are:

Whether firms’ pollution abatement effort at each period is greater in the cooperative case than in the non-cooperative case depends on parameter values such as demand sensitivity to price and marginal effectiveness of abatement efforts, yet numerical results show that the cumulative abatement efforts over the whole period are greater in the cooperative than in the non-cooperative case; up to twice that of the non-cooperative manufacturer (Fig. 2
                        ).

This result corroborates the findings that cooperation within a supply chain is related to extensive environmental efforts (Hollos et al., 2012; Klassen & Vachon, 2003; Simpson, 2010; Vachon & Klassen, 2008).

                        (t) holds ∀ t, which implies that Dc
                        (t) > Dnc
                        (t), resulting in more emissions in the cooperative than in the non-cooperative case. Conversely, these inequalities do not always hold, notably in the case of a large pollution cost coefficient. As suggested in Eq. (10), the consumer price patterns are consistent with those of abatement efforts in the cooperative case.

While double marginalization usually leads to higher consumer prices, we show that consumer prices in the cooperative case might not be strictly larger than in the non-cooperative case for a given time interval. Specifically, when the abatement effort is ineffective, a cooperative supply chain often imposes similar or even higher consumer prices than a non-cooperative supply chain in the initial periods. The intuition behind this result is that low abatement effectiveness increases total abatement cost to maintain low pollution stock. This increases the consumer price in both cooperative and non-cooperative supply chains. However, in the cooperative case, the increase in consumer price is often concentrated in the initial periods, while consumer price decreases sharply in the later periods.

                        , is maximized (minimized) when both demand sensitivity to price is low (high) and abatement effort effectiveness is high (low). For high demand sensitivity to price and low marginal effectiveness of abatement effort, a large pollution cost coefficient involves more abatement effort in the non-cooperative case than in the cooperative one. Hence, this configuration mitigates the double marginalization effect.

Stated differently, the cooperative supply chain results in lower environmental performance than the non-cooperative supply chain, although the pollution abatement effort is generally greater due to an increase in revenue. This result implies that the abatement effort in the cooperative supply chain would not suffice, despite its high volume, to outweigh high emissions.

This compromise in environmental performance is less apparent in the non-cooperative supply chain because the required level of abatement effort is lesser due to low emissions. In addition, in the cooperative case, consumer demand is higher during the later periods. Because the abatement effort decreases and vanishes by the final period, the pollution stock in the later periods is more significantly influenced by consumer demand than by the abatement effort. Conversely, the pollution stock is influenced more by the abatement effort in the initial periods, and thus the cooperative supply chain might be a more eco-friendly configuration during those periods.


                        Fig. 5b shows that, in terms of cumulative output, the cooperative supply chain still results in a higher pollution stock per unit of cumulative consumer demand than the non-cooperative supply chain, confirming the lower environmental performance of the cooperative supply chain. This result continues to hold, regardless of pollution cost coefficient, marginal effectiveness of abatement effort and demand sensitivity to price, and suggests that the cooperative supply chain makes in average less per unit abatement efforts than the non-cooperative supply chain.

Finally, Fig. 6
                        
                         compares firms’ payoffs in the cooperative and non-cooperative settings. The Nash bargaining scheme (e.g., Dockner et al., 2000) is used to compute the manufacturer's and retailer's cooperative payoffs as follows:

For a given pollution cost coefficient, the best configuration of firms’ payoffs both for cooperative and non-cooperative equilibria is that where sensitivity of demand to price is low and the manufacturer's effectiveness of abatement effort is high. Conversely, the worst configuration both for cooperative and non-cooperative equilibria is where the sensitivity of demand to price is high and the manufacturer's effectiveness of abatement effort is low. The predominant influence of demand sensitivity to price over marginal effectiveness of abatement effort is obvious in the ranking of the payoffs of the two remaining intermediate configurations.

We investigate the impact of double marginalization in a supply chain from a global perspective including both social welfare and the environmental impact. To do so, we introduce a measure of eco-friendly social welfare, defined as the amount of social welfare generated at the expense of the pollution stock. Social welfare for the entire period t ∈ [0, T] is defined as the sum of firms’ total profits and total consumer surplus as follows (Long, 2010), that is:

                        Fig. 7 shows the eco-friendly social welfare, SW/y(T), as a function of demand sensitivity β in cooperative and non-cooperative settings. The most interesting implication in Fig. 7 is that a cooperative supply chain does not always yield higher eco-friendly social welfare than a non-cooperative supply chain. Whether a cooperative supply chain generates higher eco-friendly social welfare is influenced by market characteristics and the institutional environment – i.e., demand sensitivity to price (β) and the pollution cost coefficient (f).


                        Fig. 7 shows that a cooperative supply chain tends to yield greater eco-friendly social welfare than a non-cooperative supply chain as the market becomes more price-sensitive. In contrast, when consumers are not much responsive to price changes, a non-cooperative supply chain tends to generate more eco-friendly social welfare than a cooperative supply chain. The intuition behind these results is that the advantage of large consumer surplus resulting from low prices in the cooperative case tends to be more significant as demand price sensitivity rises. Thus, despite a large pollution stock, the advantage of high social welfare in the cooperative supply chain dominates when price sensitivity is high, leading to higher eco-friendly social welfare than the non-cooperative supply chain.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper assessed the impact of decentralized decision-making on pollution accumulation in a supply chain composed of one manufacturer and one retailer under a conventional wholesale price contract. To do so, we suggested a differential game model of vertical pollution control with nonexistent natural abatement of the pollution stock.

We showed that the game allows a unique and subgame perfect equilibrium irrespective of whether moves are simultaneous or sequential, and that the influence of the double marginalization effect on pollution accumulation is unaffected by strategy types, that is, open-loop vs. feedback Nash equilibrium strategies. While the pricing strategy is farsighted in the cooperative case, it is myopic in the non-cooperative case because the retailer does not internalize the cost of pollution. In the cooperative case, the abatement effort path generally shapes the consumer price path. Further, greater abatement efforts reduce consumer demand (and emissions). In the non-cooperative case, abatement efforts are negatively influenced by the transfer price, which in turn positively affects the consumer price. As a result, double marginalization is amplified because lower abatements are concomitant with lower emissions.

This paper contributes to the literature first by bringing the double marginalization effect in a vertical supply chain explicitly to environmental economics. Although the virtue of supply chain coordination has been widely accepted, we show that this statement is only partially correct when an environmental aspect is considered. The cooperative supply chain results in lower sales price and consequently higher consumer demand in general. Also, it indeed leads to higher cumulative abatement efforts as is commonly believed, driven by an increase in revenue. However, these efforts are not sufficient to offset the greater emissions as by-products from higher production activities in the centralized supply chain because abatement efforts often require substantial investments in environment-friendly technologies, facilities and processes (Krass et al., 2013). As a result, the cooperative supply chain emits more cumulative pollution and pollution per unit output than a decentralized chain and compromises on environmental performance until it increases the supply chain profit. In the non-cooperative supply chain, however, this problem is less apparent because the level of required abatement effort is lower due to low polluting emissions. In addition, abatement efforts might be higher in the non-cooperative supply chain during the initial periods under the particular configurations involving high price-sensitive demand or low effectiveness of abatement efforts. Stated differently, although the non-cooperative supply chain ruled by a wholesale price contract and its corollary, the double marginalization effect, have been commonly recognized as inefficient, they have environmental virtue because they not only reduce polluting emissions via lower production, but also heighten manufacturer's abatement efforts.

Next, we introduced a notion of eco-friendly social welfare, measured as social welfare per unit of pollution stock, to explore the impact of double marginalization from a broader perspective including supply chain profit, consumer surplus and environmental performance. We find that the elimination of double marginalization in the cooperative supply chain generates higher eco-friendly social welfare only in some cases. When demand is highly sensitive to the sales price, a cooperative supply chain often generates greater eco-friendly social welfare than a non-cooperative chain. However, a decentralized supply chain and the presence of double marginalization tend to be more socially desirable in the converse case.

We also provide several insights for regulators. First, the general perception that a centralized supply chain is more socially desirable should be reexamined if an environmental aspect is considered. Which supply chain configuration (i.e., centralized vs decentralized) should be promoted varies depending on the priorities. If regulators intend to maximize social welfare only (i.e., firms’ profits and consumer surplus), they should facilitate a centralized supply chain. Yet if their main goal is to reduce emissions, then regulators should encourage a decentralized supply chain rather than supply chain coordination, because the elimination of double marginalization in a centralized supply chain results in greater cumulative emissions and higher emissions per unit output despite higher abatement efforts. This could be particularly relevant to industries where pollution is the most urgent issue and significant emission reduction is crucial. Moreover, if the regulators consider broader aspects of the entire economic system, including not only the environment but also both firms’ profits and consumer surplus, the optimal supply chain configuration would vary depending on the market characteristics. Specifically, regulators should encourage supply chain coordination to increase eco-friendly social welfare only when the market is price-sensitive enough. Otherwise, it might be more effective to focus on maintaining a double marginalization effect in a supply chain.

Our findings also imply that the benefits of supply chain coordination might vary depending on the firm's objective. If the goal of the firm is purely profit-seeking, managers should try to move toward a centralized supply chain. Yet if the profit-maximizing firm also cares about long-term environmental sustainability, then managers should be aware of a downside of supply chain coordination: lower environmental performance. Managers should learn how to overcome this environmental issue in a coordinated supply chain and find ways to balance short-term profit maximization and long-term environmental sustainability.

This paper has demonstrated the importance of double marginalization on pollution accumulation. For future research, our vertical pollution game can be extended to account for price competition in a bilateral duopoly. This important topic is high on our research agenda.

                     A4. Assuming that the manufacturer is the leader and the retailer the follower, the retailer's necessary condition in (22) does not contain the retailer's costate variable, which therefore does not affect the manufacturer's Hamiltonian in (16), and confirms that the unique open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium. Conversely, assuming that the retailer is the leader and the manufacturer the follower, the manufacturer's necessary condition in (18) and the costate equation in (17) lead us to rewrite the retailer's Hamiltonian as:

Solving this differential system with the related transversality conditions, the retailer's costate variables associated with the pollution stock and manufacturer's costate variable are both zero over the whole game, which confirms that the unique open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium also in this case.


                     A5. Plugging the expression from (23) in (A3.9) and (22), and solving gives (27) and (28).


                     A6. Here also, the game is solved backward. To identify a FBNE, we first construct the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations of the two players, that is:

                      holds. Finally, plugging the right-hand side of (29) in (A6.19)–(A6.21) respectively gives (30)–(32).


                     A7. Assuming that the manufacturer is the leader and the retailer the follower, plugging the retailer's necessary condition in (A6.4) in the manufacturer's HJB equation in (A6.1) does not affect the manufacturer's necessary condition in (A6.3), which confirms that the unique feedback Stackelberg equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium. Conversely, assuming that the retailer is the leader and the manufacturer the follower, we plug the manufacturer's necessary condition in (A6.3) in the retailer's HJB equation in (A6.2) and see that the retailer's necessary condition in (A6.4) is unaffected, which implies that the unique feedback Stackelberg equilibrium is also a Nash equilibrium.


                     A8. Plugging the expression from (29) in (A6.21) and the expressions from (29) and (31) in (2), respectively, and solving the resulting expression gives (33) and (34).

                     . Then, whether Gv
                      > 0 holds depends on the parameter values β and φ. We highlight below the role played by the parameters β and φ in the value of Gv
                     . Although the range of β and φ such that Gv
                      > 0 cannot be obtained explicitly, we can show that Gv
                      > 0 holds for smaller values of β and/or larger values of φ, other things being equal, as shown in Table A10.1. From the limit value analysis, we conclude that there exists a threshold

                      holds. Therefore, y(T)/ yol
                     (T) > 1 holds when k ≥ 3 and γ( < 1) approaches zero. Whether (37) holds analytically is less clear when k ≥ 3 and γ < 1, than for the case where k < 3 and for the case where k ≥ 3 and γ > 1 due to the complexity of (A12.1). However, it can be shown that (37) holds numerically for all (k, γ) because the minimum value of
