                  This paper analyzes risk management contracts used to handle currency risk in a decentralized supply chain that consists of risk-averse divisions in a multinational firm. Particular contracts of interest involve transferring risk to a third party by using risk-transfer contracts such as currency options and re-arranging risk between supply chain members using risk-sharing contracts. Due to decentralization, operational and risk management decisions are made locally; however, a headquarter who is interested in total supply chain profit has some controllability over those activities. We question if each kind of risk management contract can improve the utility of all supply chain members compared to the utility without any of those, and how the conditions to achieve such improvements are different. Further structural differences are investigated via sensitivity analysis with respect to the transfer price, the variability of exchange rates, and the location of the headquarter. We also find that using the two kinds of contracts jointly does not necessarily result in better outcomes.
               
            

As global operations in multinational firms grow in popularity, the internal transactions of such firms are increasingly carried out internationally. This phenomenon makes profits and losses heavily dependent on the movements of exchange rates. While it is relatively rare to observe significant changes in production costs within a short time, it is not uncommon to see radical changes of exchange rates in the same period. For example, the US dollar fell by 11% against Brazil’s real in 2011 from January to August (Economist, 2011) and Brazilian suppliers suffered big losses. That year, on the other hand, the Japanese yen fell by 5% against the US dollar (Kim, 2012), incurring losses for US buyers. In fact, currency fluctuations of 
                        
                           20
                           %
                        
                      in one year are not rare (Dornier, Ernst, Fender, & Kouvelis, 1998). Thus, not surprisingly, risk from exchange-rate uncertainty is one of the top concerns of supply chain executives, as reported in The Economist’s recent survey of 500 global firms’ executives (Economist Intelligence Unit, 2009).

This paper considers a decentralized supply chain of a multinational firm whose divisional and total profits are affected by exchange-rate uncertainties. If the variability of total profits is high due to fluctuating exchange rates, maximizing expected profits without consideration of variances may not lead to practical decisions. For this reason, profit variance, which stands for riskiness, is an important element of our model. Our supply chain model involves a multinational firm with a retail division and a supply division whose decisions are affected by such riskiness. Indeed, the operations management literature has shown growing interest in decisions made by risk-averse suppliers and retailers. The work of Lau (1980a) is one of the seminal papers that consider a single risk-averse newsvendor whose ordering decision depends on total exposure to demand uncertainty. Lau and Lau (1999), Tsay (2002), and recently Gan, Sethi, and Yan (2004) consider a supply chain where both the retailer and the supplier are risk-averse. For the analysis of decisions in a risk-averse supply chain, we follow the literature (e.g., Ding, Dong, & Kouvelis, 2007; Choi, Li, Yan, & Chiu, 2008; Buzacott, Yan, & Zhang, 2011) and use mean–variance utility.

In such situations, risk-averse decision makers in a supply chain naturally wish to manage the mean and the variance of profits to improve their utilities, possibly with effective risk management tools. Various types of contracts have been implemented for this purpose. One popular method is to transfer risk to a third party by buying, for example, currency options from local financial markets or banks (O’Brien, 1996), which we call hereafter as risk-transfer contracts. For example, when a firm plans to pay in a foreign currency, losses due to adverse movements of the foreign exchange rate can be mitigated by buying currency call options. This contract gives its holder the right to convert the domestic currency into the foreign currency at a pre-determined rate. Clearly, this conversion would be made if the spot exchange rate were higher than the pre-determined rate, which lessens the impact from currency rate changes (Sodhi & Tang, 2012, chap. 8). Thus purchasing hedging contracts enables a firm to transfer some or all currency risks to a third party, that is, the options seller.

Another popular method of managing exchange-rate uncertainty is to share risk with other parties involved in operations. The survey of Carter and Vickery (1988) shows that more than 50% of responding firms used some form of risk sharing with their suppliers. This approach, which we call risk-sharing contracts, is made between transaction parties, who commit themselves to sharing profits or losses resulting from exchange-rate movements (Eliteman, Stonehill, & Moffett, 2004) if, for example, exchange-rate is outside a pre-determined range. For example, a retailer in the United States can agree to adjust the price in euros for a supplier in Europe if the exchange rate becomes very high or very low, depending on whether the supplier’s currency is strong or weak (Fisher et al., 2007). Thus a risk-sharing contract enables a firm to re-arrange currency risks between transaction parties of a risk-averse supply chain. Note that this does not entail extra payments or fees outside the chain. There is an additional incentive to consider risk-sharing because in the options exchanges typical options contracts are specified in terms of currencies, maturities, and strikes. Also, there may be a limited supply and volume for a specific contract. Thus, one may find it difficult to execute a risk-transfer contract that fits his/her purposes, and this makes risk-sharing an attractive option to consider.

A supplier and a retailer in separate firms can locally manage currency risks for each one’s best interest. The management of currency risks for a multinational firm who owns both as its sub-divisions, however, is more complicated since the firm’s total profits should also be considered. According to US and international accounting standards, a multinational firm is required to prepare a consolidated financial statement in each period by converting the net profit of each division into the single reporting currency in which the firm’s main business is conducted. See, e.g., Accounting Standards Codification 830 of Financial Accounting Standards and International Accounting Standard 21 of International Financial Reporting Standards. The impact of exchange-rate uncertainty on such total net profits can be significant. For example, McDonald’s Corporation operates across 119 countries and converts local currencies back into US dollars to prepare a consolidated statement. It is reported that the firm suffered a 
                        
                           4
                           %
                        
                      decrease in its net income in the second quarter of 2012 due to unfavorable changes in exchange rates (AP News, 2012). Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the headquarters (HQ) of a multinational firm is concerned about its total supply chain profit being converted into one main currency, even though HQ may not be directly involved in the operational decisions of a decentralized supply chain.

The attitude of HQ toward currency risk can differ from that of local divisions in a supply chain due to different business environments, sizes, or managers’ preferences. Kanodia (1979) and Yahya-Zadeh (1998), for instance, study efficient coordination and risk sharing when central and divisional managers are different in risk aversion in the context of the design of transfer price systems. Such different preferences naturally lead us to the question of whether a desirable outcome for HQ can be achieved when the local divisions actively implement effective risk management tools. In addition, we are interested in studying the conditions under which HQ’s overseeing activities and local divisions’ risk managing activities eventually become beneficial for all members of a supply chain. We investigate the two ways of managing exchange-rate risk: (i) transferring risk to a third party with a risk-transfer contract such as currency options and (ii) re-arranging risk within the chain with a risk-sharing contract. For each kind of contracts, we study if there exists a set of contract terms such that utility of all members of a supply chain can increase compared to the utility without any of those. We also ask what are the impacts of exchange-rate variability and re-location of HQ. We believe that our model provides helpful information regarding desirable terms of such contracts, and thus should be useful to operational managers of multinational firms seeking effective currency risk management tools.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review. Section 3 describes our model and provides a preliminary analysis of a benchmark model. Section 4 analyzes risk management contracts, and conducts sensitivity analysis and comparative statics. Section 5 concludes the study and suggests future research directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The literature on operational decisions under exchange uncertainty is vast. These include but are not limited to the works of Kogut and Kulatilaka (1994), Huchzermeier and Cohen (1996), Dasu and Li (1997), Kouvelis and Gutierrez (1997), Kouvelis (1999), and recently Liu and Nagurney (2011). The modeling details and focuses of studies are quite diverse. However, the literature neglects to consider currency option and risk-sharing contracts together in a single context. These two types of contracts, both popularly practiced, are comparable in the sense that one transfers currency risk to a third party by purchasing a financial contract and the other rearranges currency risk between local divisions in a supply chain without external fees. Hence, the interactions between members of a supply chain of a multinational firm are of great interest when different types of risk management activities are involved. Particularly interesting are the structural differences in the conditions under which a certain risk transfer tool is beneficial for all members of a supply chain.

Let us briefly review the literature related to the contracts to transfer or share currency risks. Regarding risk-transfer contracts, the use of options is part of the classical risk management toolkit. For example, in the operations management literature, Gaur and Seshadri (2005) calculate an optimal hedging portfolio with call options in a single-period model to manage demand risk. Chen and Parlar (2007) discuss the usage of a put option to reduce losses from low demand in the same single-period stochastic demand model. More specifically, in managing exchange-rate uncertainty, the literature considers currency options. For instance, Ding et al. (2007) study production (postponement) and financial hedging (currency call and put options) portfolios to manage exchange-rate risk. However, few papers study risk-sharing contracts. For instance, Li and Kouvelis (1999) consider a risk-sharing contract in finding an optimal procurement policy to manage price uncertainty under fixed demand. Arcelus, Pakkala, and Srinivasan (2002) consider risk-sharing with a simple two-price type contract under exchange-rate uncertainty, as we do. While Arcelus et al. (2002) focus on finding the best ordering cycle in a continuous review inventory model of a risk-neutral retailer with risk-sharing, we are concerned about establishing contract terms such that the risk-averse utility of members of a supply chain improves. Furthermore, we focus on comparing the impact of the two kinds of contracts on utility of all members in a risk-averse supply chain.

As mentioned in Section 1, maximization of expected profits under the assumption of risk-neutral supply chain members is not likely to yield an optimal decision in practice. This is also noted by Lau (1980a) and Eeckhoudt, Gollier, and Schlesinger (1995) in the context of managing demand uncertainty. Further information on this issue of risk-averse agents can be found in the works of Lau (1980b), Bouakiz and Sobel (1992), and Agrawal and Seshadri (2000), for example. More recent papers include those of Keren and Pliskin (2006), Chen, Sim, Simchi-Levi, and Sun (2007), Tang and Rudi (2010), Wu, Wang, Chao, Ng, and Cheng (2010), and Chernonog and Kogan (in press). Our model uses mean–variance utility, which has been widely used in the literature, in analyzing decisions made by risk-averse divisions in a supply chain. For instance, Lau and Lau (1999) study pricing and the return credit strategies of a manufacturer with mean–variance utility. Chen et al. (2000) also apply the mean–variance utility framework to a single-echelon basic inventory problem. Wu, Li, Wang, and Cheng (2009) consider the newsvendor problem under mean–variance utility with stockout cost. Recently, Buzacott et al. (2011) analyze commitment–option contracts in a supply chain that consists of risk-averse agents with mean–variance utility. In addition to mean–variance utility, a downside risk-averse retailer has been proposed. See Nawrocki (1999), Gan, Sethi, and Yan (2005), Gotoh and Takano (2007) and Wu, Zhu, and Teunter (2013), for example. A comprehensive review on the risk analysis in a supply chain can be found in e.g., Chiu and Choi (in press). However, as mentioned by Grootveld and Hallerback (1999), downside-risk and mean–variance utilities do not exhibit significant differences in many cases. Also, Choi and Chiu (2012) reports that the solution scheme of the optimal ordering decision under the mean–variance utility and downside-risk utility are the same. We thus content ourselves with mean–variance utility in this paper, leaving other possibilities to be explored in the future.

The HQ in a decentralized supply chain may have only limited controllability over operational decisions. Regarding controllability over risk management activities, there is a wide spectrum of modeling possibilities; however, in this work HQ is assumed to oversee the risk management activities of local divisions by allowing risk-transfer or risk-sharing (which HQ would if such activities were beneficial). Such an assumption regarding HQ’s power on risk management activities can be rationalized for large multinational enterprizes: Buckley and Strange (2011) explain potentially large governance and transaction costs and the differences between key decision makers in attitudes toward risk. For this reason, Mulvey and Erkan (2006) study optimal decentralized risk management strategies, even though their interests lie with financial companies rather than supply chains. Kapitsinas (2008) reports in their study of Greek firms that while many firms implement centralized risk management, centralized coordination with decentralized risk management is also popular.

For a multinational firm’s decentralized supply chain, coordination of the chain is an important issue. Gan et al. (2004) define utility coordination and analyze it for a supply chain with a risk-averse retailer and supplier. The authors define coordination as a contract that can maximize the sum of the expected utilities of the retailer and the supplier. Choi et al. (2008) also study the coordination of a supply chain with risk-averse agents with mean–variance utilities under demand uncertainty. In their model of one retailer and one supplier, the supplier acts as the supply chain coordinator and the chain’s coordination is defined as matching the retailer’s optimal order quantity to that of the supplier, whose concern is the entire supply chain’s performance. Our study differs from these papers because we consider HQ a separate member of a supply chain, with its own utility. While not directly involved in operations decisions, HQ oversees local risk management activities and terms of contracts to maximize the utility. Thus, our model can be considered a generalized version of the model of Choi et al. (2008). Different risk appetites between members are quite plausible because, for example, environments, incentives, or rewards may be very different. We then define the coordination in this decentralized risk-averse supply chain as a contract such that the optimal order quantity for a retailer coincides with the order quantity that maximizes HQ’s utility.

Since we focus on internal transactions made by the divisions of a single multinational firm, the transfer price plays an important role for both incentive alignment and tax reporting purposes. A number of papers in the literature consider transfer price as one of the main decision variables; Vidal and Goetschalckx (2001) study the optimal transfer price in a supply chain network design with an upper and lower bound restriction on a transfer price. Shunko and Gavirneni (2007) and Shunko, Debo, and Gavirneni (2014) study the impact of transfer pricing on operational decisions and the corresponding profits under cost uncertainty. While we compare utility changes by two risk management approaches under exchange-rate uncertainties, Huh and Park (2013) compare supply chain performances by two popular transfer pricing rules, that is, cost plus and resale price methods under demand uncertainty. Although these papers consider the transfer price an important modeling feature, we prefer to take the transfer price as given by assuming it is set by the incentive alignment between the retailer and the supplier. By fixing the transfer price exogenously, we can focus on the impacts of currency risk together with risk management tools in our supply chain model. At the very least, we analyze the impact of the transfer price on conditions for utility improvements.

Although not our main interest, alternatively, the operational hedging of currency risk has received considerable attention. For example, Huchzermeier and Cohen (1996) and Kogut and Kulatilaka (1994) study operational hedging with excess capacity and the switching of production facility/country. We also refer the reader to Kouvelis (1999), Kazaz, Dada, and Moskowitz (2005), Liu and Nagurney (2011), and references therein for more details on this research direction.

Let us begin by describing our model and conducting a preliminary analysis. We assume that a retail division and a supply division are risk-averse with different risk preference parameters. The retail division (hereafter the retailer) resides in country R, the supply division (hereafter the supplier) resides in country S. We first assume that HQ is located in country R. Since the location of HQ affects the net profit in our model, we will consider the opposite case later in Section 4.4. Due to decentralization, HQ has limited control over risk management activities but we consider a situation where HQ is at least able to disallow risk-transfer or risk-sharing contracts between the retailer and the supplier. This decision depends on whether such a contract improves HQ’s utility. In the case of risk-sharing, all members of a supply chain negotiate the terms of the contract. In the case of risk-transfer, we assume that currency options are considered and their notional amounts are the decision variables. In any case, the retailer decides the order quantity to maximize his utility. Clearly, this quantity is dependent on the type of risk management contracts the retailer enters.

The sequence of events in our model is as follows.
                        
                           1.
                           Upon receipt of an order from the retailer, the supplier produces the supply at a cost of 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          c
                                       
                                       
                                          m
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               (S) per unit and delivers at the beginning of a selling season at the transfer price w (S) per unit.

The retailer who buys the supply from the supplier makes final products at an additional cost of 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          c
                                       
                                       
                                          r
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               per unit in currency (R). He sells them in the retail market with deterministic demand D at the unit price p, again in currency (R).

At the end of the selling season, the retailer makes the payment in currency (S) by purchasing the currency at the spot exchange rate.

Note that we assume a deterministic demand, as do Dasu and Li (1997), Li and Kouvelis (1999), Kazaz et al. (2005), and Shunko et al. (2014). This feature allows us to focus on exchange-rate uncertainties. The spot exchange rate at the end of the selling season is denoted e, meaning that one (R) is exchanged with e (S).

We summarize the symbols in our model in Table 1
                     .
                        Remark
                        Depending on the currency used in international transactions, the supplier may or may not take the currency risk. For example, if a transaction is made in currency (R), then all currency risks are on the supplier. In this work, we study the effects of risk management contracts in a fixed supply chain network. However, it would be an interesting future research topic to study the effects of different network designs, including who takes the currency risk.

We start our analysis with the benchmark case, which does not consider any risk management contracts. The end-of-season realized profits in the benchmark case are given as follows:

                     The supplier’s profit has zero variance since it is assumed that w is paid in currency (S), hence she is not exposed to any currency risk.

It is reasonable and justifiable to tax authorities to set w and p in such a way that the retailer and the supplier make nonnegative expected profits. Such nonnegative expected profits are guaranteed by the next two assumptions on our model parameters.

We do not model the decision of optimal transfer price since both legal and incentive objectives are involved. Instead, we study whether a given transfer price is beneficial to the members of a supply chain with risk-transfer or risk-sharing contracts.

The retailer sets the order quantity to maximize his utility. It is easy to see that the optimal order quantity is

                     The optimal order quantity is determined by balancing marginal expected revenue (which increases the mean of the profit) and marginal exposure with currency risk (which increases the variance of the profit). Thus, although the demand is deterministic, the utility can be maximized by ordering less than D. Since the retailer and HQ have different risk preference parameters, the order quantity that maximizes the retailer’s utility does not necessarily maximize HQ’s utility. The left panel of Fig. 1
                      compares the optimal order quantities of the retailer and HQ depending on risk preference parameters. We observe that critical values of risk preference parameters exist for the retailer and HQ—say

                     —beyond which both optimal order quantities are less than D.

From Fig. 1, we can make another interesting observation. When the optimal order quantities of both the retailer and HQ are less than D, those quantities coincide for risk preference parameters on the oblique line. In other words, the optimal order quantity of a centralized supply chain (the quantity HQ would have set) is also optimal for the decentralized one (the order quantity of the retailer). We thus turn our attention to when the coordination of optimal order quantities happens. If both the retailer and HQ are extremely risk-averse or D is large enough, the order quantities that maximize their utilities are strictly less than D. In this situation, both order quantities coincide if and only if

In practice, a transfer price is set by considering profit allocations to the retailer and the supplier, and other legal restrictions. We thus assume in our model that a transfer price is given by considering such incentives and restrictions. However, Eq. (3.1) still provides useful information in setting a transfer price when it comes to the coordination of a risk-averse supply chain. Let us say that w induces coordination if (3.1) is satisfied for given risk preference parameters. Then, as long as the retailer is less risk-averse than HQ, a coordination-inducing transfer price higher than the production cost can be found. This is contrasted with the channel coordination of a risk-neutral supply chain. However, this coordination never happens when HQ is less risk-averse than the retailer; otherwise, the transfer price should be less than

                      and this is not justifiable to tax authorities. When a multinational firm has a diversified portfolio of businesses, HQ is likely to be less risk-averse than the retailer. (In a related context, it has been noted in the literature that firms with larger sizes are less risk-averse, Kihlstrom & Laffont (1979), for instance.) The next section shows that such limitation on coordination with less risk-averse HQ can be overcome through risk-transfer or risk-sharing.

                                 λ
                              
                              
                                 R
                              
                           
                           /
                           
                              
                                 λ
                              
                              
                                 HQ
                              
                           
                        
                     . It shows that such transfer prices decrease in this ratio. This can be understood as a more risk-averse HQ than the retailer would require a higher transfer price to reduce the retailer’s order quantity to the level that matches 
                        
                           
                              
                                 q
                              
                              
                                 HQ
                              
                              
                                 o
                              
                           
                        
                     . However, quite intuitively, setting such a high coordination-inducing transfer price would be very difficult since the retailer’s profit would be too low.

Before we move onto the next section, we add the last comment on the market demand. While we have assumed a deterministic demand, it is still important to understand how the risk averse ordering decision would change for random demand under exchange rate uncertainty. It is easy to obtain the retailer’s utility under demand and exchange rate uncertainty as follows:

                     We notice that there is no longer a simple closed-form for the optimal ordering decision from this equation. However, we observe from (3.2) that the variability of D decreases the retailer’s utility just like 
                        
                           1
                           /
                           e
                        
                     . On the other hand, the correlation between 
                        
                           D
                           ,
                           
                           1
                           /
                           e
                        
                      also affects the order quantity if they are not independent. Thus, we expect that the joint behavior of D and 
                        
                           1
                           /
                           e
                        
                      would tilt the retailer’s decisions. Such considerations lead to the problem of joint risk management of demand and exchange rate uncertainties altogether, which is itself an interesting research question. However, as we focus on exchange rate risk management via financial or sharing contracts, we leave this as a potential topic to be explored in the future.
                        Remark
                        While the mean–variance utility is widely used in the literature in analyzing risk-averse decisions, the downside-risk utility has been increasingly popular as well. It is therefore worth investigating how our results change under the downside-risk utility which is defined as follows:

                           While the mean–variance utility does not differentiate the upside and downside outcomes, the downside-risk utility imposes penalties only when the profit does not exceed a certain threshold 
                              
                                 θ
                              
                           . However, our preliminary numerical analysis shows that, similar to the case of the mean–variance utility, there is the same trade-off between profit and variability, leading to optimal order quantities less than D. This happens when the marginal probability exceeds the marginal expected profit in the downside-risk utility and it is more prominent as the exchange rate has heavier tails. From the numerical analysis, we see that the risk-averse retailer’s overall decision making behavior may not significantly depend on the choice of the utility, at least for the purposes of this paper. Nonetheless, it would be still interesting to study the impacts of the exchange-rate distributions on the downside-risk utility and the optimal decisions of supply chain members. We leave this as a potential future research topic.

In this section, we analyze both currency options and risk-sharing contracts. We study the optimal usage of currency options and the terms of risk-sharing contracts in maximizing a local division’s utility. We also investigate the impact of such contracts on the utilities of other members in a supply chain.

As stated in the previous section, we assume that the retailer pays the supplier in currency (S). The retailer would suffer a loss if the currency (S) appreciated, that is, e decreased. To compensate for this possible loss, if allowed by HQ, the retailer buys a call option with notional value N on the exchange rate 
                           
                              1
                              /
                              e
                           
                         with strike K. There are certainly many different choices for hedging using financial derivatives, but we focus on a single option because all the other choices would play essentially the same role in maximizing utility, that is, balancing the expected return and variance. Our choice simplifies analysis without losing the main managerial insights. The retailer decides the order quantity q and the notional amount N of the option contract. Each member’s realized profit in the supply chain with the currency option becomes

                         with respect to N for given q. We mention that a general version of this result using multiple currency options is reported in Ding et al. (2007). From (4.1), we observe that the notional amount is proportional to the total exposure to exchange-rate uncertainty, that is, wq. In addition, the notional amount is decreasing in

                        , which means that the retailer buys a smaller size of the option as the risk premium of the option increases. Finally, such an effect of a large risk premium of the option dissipates if the retailer becomes highly risk-averse. The following lemma records the optimal order quantity and the optimal notional of the currency option contract for the retailer.

                         implies that the risk premium of the option is costly to the extent that a positive notional of the currency option does not increase the retailer’s utility even if it is allowed by HQ. In this case,

                         and the retailer’s optimal order quantity does not change from that of the benchmark case. Otherwise, a positive amount of financial hedge is beneficial to the retailer. It is because, in this case, the benefit from the decrease in the variance of the retailer’s profit outweighs the effect of the decrease in the expected profit. In the special case of 
                           
                              Δ

                         is always violated and thus it is optimal for the retailer to strictly increase his order quantity.

Let us take a closer look at the condition. The right-hand side consists of two terms: The first term,

                        , depends on how well the option payoff explains the exchange rate 
                           
                              1

                        . It is the regression coefficient when we regress the option payoff on 
                           
                              1

                        . From the condition, a risk-transfer contract is likely to be implemented as this quantity increases. The second term, 
                           
                              (

                        , depends on the profit margin and transfer price. As the profit margin increases or the transfer price decreases, the retailer tends to make more profit. Then the condition suggests that the retailer has more room to improve his utility by entering into a currency option contract. However, as the mean of 
                           
                              1

                         increases, the retailer makes less profit and such flexibility becomes more limited.

The optimal order quantity for HQ is easily obtained from the above lemma by substituting w with

                        Proposition 4.1 shows that a financial hedge by the retailer makes the utility of HQ more sensitive to the ratio of the risk preference parameters of the retailer and HQ. Recall that this risk-transfer results in

                        , then HQ is quite risk-averse and the utility in the benchmark case is already negative. In this situation, increasing the order quantity only makes HQ’s utility more negative. An intuitive explanation for this phenomenon is that risk-transfer contracts in general encourage operational activities of the retailer but these affect HQ who actually needs to slow down the retailer. Therefore, we can conclude that risk-transfer contracts may not be beneficial to HQ and hence will not be allowed if HQ is significantly more risk-averse than the retailer.

We now consider the case where the transfer price w is different from 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                                 
                                    m
                                 
                              
                           
                        . It is easy to see that as it increases, the retailer’s utility tends to decrease due to the decreasing mean and increasing variance of profits. If compared to the benchmark case, however, the retailer’s utility improvement grows in w. Nonetheless, it is not obvious how the transfer price affects HQ’s utility due to the combined effects of

                         numerically shows that HQ’s utility improvement tends to decrease in w. Two curves correspond to the differences between HQ’s utilities under the benchmark case and the risk-transfer case. But the dotted line in the figure also shows that the utility difference can increase when w is slightly higher than

                         are no greater than D (see Appendix A for a derivation of this result). While this finding does not have a simple explanation, it appears that a nonlinear dependence of HQ’s utility on w exists.

Regarding the supplier’s utility, it is clear that it has a linear relationship with w with a nonnegative slope. Since the retailer’s order quantity increases, that is,

                                    H

                         as proved in Lemma 4.1, it follows that the supplier’s utility increases as well. Therefore, if risk-transfer improves HQ’s utility, it improves the utility of every member of the supply chain. In the right panel of Fig. 2, we numerically calculate the interval of w, say, 
                           
                              I
                           
                        , such that a risk-transfer contract (currency call-option in our case) that is beneficial for the retailer improves HQ’s utility as well. We plot this interval, especially 
                           
                              max

                        . If a given transfer price is within the interval 
                           
                              I
                           
                        , the retailer’s financial hedge improves everyone’s utility. But we observe that as

                                    R
                                 
                              
                           
                         increases, such improvements are more difficult to achieve because the interval 
                           
                              I
                           
                         becomes narrower. Therefore, as HQ becomes more risk-averse than the retailer, a given transfer price is more likely to be outside of the interval so that HQ’s utility is no better than the benchmark case. Then HQ has no incentive to allow such a risk-transfer. Therefore, we can conclude that a flexible range exists for the transfer price for utility improvements with risk-transfer contracts, but that the range decreases as the difference in risk preferences increases.

It is also of our interests to see the behaviors of the outcomes with positive risk premium 
                           
                              Δ
                              >
                              0
                           
                        . From the results in the earlier part of this section, we observe that the optimal notional decreases for a sizable risk premium of the option. And this makes the effect of risk-transfer diminished. In addition, depending on parameter values, it may be optimal for the retailer not to enter into hedge transactions, as the condition in Proposition 4.1 implies. We also numerically investigate if our results are robust with respect to changes in 
                           
                              Δ
                           
                         and K. Fig. 3
                         shows the utility improvement of the HQ with the risk-transfer contract. Those graphs are the sensitivities of the utility difference as a function of the risk premium 
                           
                              Δ
                           
                         and the option strike K, respectively. The left one shows that overall the structure of the result is not very sensitive to 
                           
                              Δ
                           
                        , suggesting that the results do not significantly depend on 
                           
                              Δ
                           
                        . However, we observe from the right panel that the impact of K on the utility difference is relatively high and the utility difference is more sensitive when K is around 
                           
                              E
                              [
                              1

                              ]
                           
                        . Also, it appears that the utility improvement is decreasing in K, which is expected because the contract gets closer to a forward contract as K decreases in this particular example.
                           Remark
                           So far, we have assumed that the retailer is a joint optimizer of the order quantity and the notional value. However, it is also plausible that the retailer uses financial instruments only after exposure to currency risk, wq, is determined for some reason. Then, it is not difficult to show that the utility differences for HQ (hedging versus no hedging) are given by

We now study a risk-sharing contract under which cash flow between the retailer and the supplier depends on the realized exchange rate. Such a contract is different from a risk-transfer contract because currency risk is rearranged within a supply chain. Although there are various forms of risk-sharing between parties to a contract, we adopt one specific form described in Li and Kouvelis (1999) and Fisher et al. (2007): it has a currency band consisting of two predetermined rates such that the profits and losses are shared if the exchange rate is outside the band. More specifically, there are three parameters such that

We assume that the parameters of a risk-sharing contract are negotiated by the divisions and HQ of the supply chain. This is a reasonable assumption because any change in the contract parameters would affect the utilities of all members. While we do not explicitly model such a negotiation process between members, our model can provide some helpful information regarding a contract’s desirable terms. In particular, we investigate whether a parameter set of a contract exists such that the utilities of all members improve for a given transfer price. As usual, the order quantity is determined by the retailer. We denote the corresponding utilities by

The condition in Proposition 4.2 is quite involved. However, it is a useful tool to see if the terms of a risk-sharing contract could yield a desirable outcome to both the retailer and HQ. Note the similarity between this inequality and (3.1). As in the latter equation, the condition in Proposition 4.2 is satisfied if 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    λ
                                 
                                 
                                    HQ
                                 
                              
                           
                         is sufficiently large. If this is the case, the proposition shows that a risk-sharing contract has the potential to become an effective tool for channel coordination. Even if 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    λ
                                 
                                 
                                    HQ
                                 
                              
                           
                         is not so large or smaller than 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    λ
                                 
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                              
                           
                        , we observe that the condition can be satisfied as long as 
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                         is suitably set. Thus as the supplier shares more risk with the retailer who initially takes all exchange-rate risk, a risk-sharing contract has more potential to achieve channel coordination. However, satisfying the condition does not mean that it also improves the utilities of the other members of the supply chain. If not, such a contract may be difficult to negotiate. Hence, we investigate conditions such that a sharing contract improves everyone’s utilities simultaneously.

                        , if the risk preference parameters of all the members satisfy (4.6), then a risk-sharing contract achieves both channel coordination and improves all utilities. Unlike a risk-transfer contract using currency option (which can involve non-negligible prices or service fees), such results can be achieved without any payments to a third party. Hence, a risk-sharing contract clearly is a good candidate for a risk management tool for a risk-averse supply chain. Fig. 4

We see that it may be easier to find the terms of a risk-sharing contract that satisfy two inequalities in (4.7) if the transfer price is relatively high. To elaborate on this, let us denote the region of 
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                         that satisfies (4.7) by 
                           
                              J
                              (
                              w
                              )
                           
                        . If we consider another region, say,

                        , there is more flexibility for the choice of 
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                         to achieve utility improvements. A numerical example is shown in Fig. 5
                        . Those graphs illustrate the amounts of utility improvements for each member with risk-sharing compared to the benchmark case. Such improvements are presented as functions of the transfer price w. From the figure, we note that the utilities of HQ and the supplier are negative at 
                           
                              w
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                                 
                                    m
                                 
                              
                           
                         but become positive when w is suitably large. When the transfer price is high, the supplier earns a relatively large profit compared to the retailer and the retailer’s order quantity is smaller than in the case with relatively small w due to risk aversion. A risk-sharing contract is useful in easing this situation so that the order quantity increases without hurting the supplier’s utility.

We also study the interactions between risk preference parameters and the transfer price. Fig. 6
                         shows the regions for the transfer price such that all members are benefitted through risk-sharing, in terms of the ratio

Thus far we have analyzed two well-known exchange rate management schemes separately. However, while the risk transfer contract is pervasive, it is not always guaranteed to obtain the specific contract from the local bank or the local financial market; the currency options contract is not always liquid enough and not all currency options are popularly traded in the market. Furthermore, even if it is possible to obtain the risk transfer contract, the price of options would increase if the demand increased for a given supply. On the other hand, while the risk sharing contract may be beneficial to all members in a supply chain, it is still possible that each member is better off if a particular risk transfer contract is also acquired. It is thus natural that the players in a supply chain would consider a combination of risk-transfer and risk-sharing contracts as a viable option.

Suppose that supply chain members agree upon the terms of a risk-sharing contract. Then, the retailer and the supplier are exposed to currency risks and are allowed to handle their currency risk exposures. Even though it is natural to assume that both the retailer and the supplier transact with local banks, we restrict ourselves to the case in which the retailer only implements a risk-transfer contract to avoid unnecessary mathematical complications. Then, the final payoffs to the supply chain members can be written as

                        . To summarize, the effects of risk-transfer and risk-sharing on the retailer’s utility are the same. By a certain ratio, the optimal ordering quantities increase and so do the utilities. Therefore, as long as a suitable risk reduction can be made, the retailer is indifferent between risk-transfer and risk-sharing. In other words, both approaches are substitutable to the retailer.

                        These observations imply that, first, risk-transfer on top of risk-sharing affects the utility of HQ by a simple multiplier, which is observed in the case of a risk-transfer contract only, while the effect of risk-sharing is associated with the magnitude of

                        . Therefore, judicious use of both contracts is required to boost the benefits of HQ. Second, due to the parameter 
                           
                              γ

                         under which the above inequality is valid is smaller than for the case of risk-sharing only. Combining this with the condition

                        , we obtain a similar equation to (4.6). We therefore conclude that the joint usage of the two types of contracts does not necessarily lead to utility improvements, even though each type of contract results in increased utilities. However, when these more restrictive conditions are satisfied, the outcomes are obviously more beneficial.

In this section, we discuss the impact of exchange-rate variability on the conditions for the utility improvement of supply chain members. We also study how such conditions are affected when HQ is located in country S so that HQ and the retailer have opposite currency-risk exposures.

Let us fix the mean of e at one and increase its variance as in the left panel of Fig. 7
                         where three different regions are plotted by varying the distribution of the exchange rate. Each region denotes the area in which risk-transfer benefits all supply chain members. This figure shows the region for the ratio

                                    HQ
                                 
                              
                              /
                              
                                 
                                    λ
                                 
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                              
                           
                         and the transfer price for which the utilities of the retailer and HQ improve under a risk-transfer contract. We observe that the region tends to decrease as 
                           
                              Var
                              (
                              e
                              )
                           
                         increases overall but we also note that such behavior is not monotonic in

                                    HQ
                                 
                              
                              /
                              
                                 
                                    λ
                                 
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                              
                           
                        , as seen in the figure. The upper bounds of these regions are determined by the maximum transfer price satisfying Assumption 2.

Recall that, in sharing, the supplier’s utility also changes and it is important to verify the supplier’s utility improvement. Due to this addition, we plot the conditions for the utility improvement of all members in the right panel of Fig. 7 where again three different regions for the ratios of risk-averseness parameters are plotted with different exchange rate distributions. The transfer price is fixed at a constant. As in risk-transfer, the region for utility improvement together with channel coordination decreases and thus becomes more restrictive to achieve as 
                           
                              Var
                              (
                              e
                              )
                           
                         increases. But, unlike in risk-transfer, the impact of this variability appears to be monotonic.

So far we have focused on the case where the retailer and HQ are located in the same country, R. There are several other possibilities for the supply chain network design. Depending on the locations of the supply chain members, their exposures to exchange-rate risk are different, possibly resulting in different optimal risk-management policies. In particular, we are interested in the case where HQ is located in the same country as the supplier. Then, the retailer still assumes the currency risk in the form of the transfer price 
                           
                              w
                              /
                              e
                           
                        , but HQ faces the currency risk from sales, that is, 
                           
                              (
                              p
                              -
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                                 
                                    r
                                 
                              
                              )
                              e
                           
                         per unit sale. We use tilde marks in the notation to differentiate this from the case where HQ is located in country R.

Let us consider a risk-transfer contract. Since the situation is the same for the supplier and the retailer, their realized profits and utilities are unchanged. But HQ now has the profit function

                         exists such that the risk-transfer improves the utility of HQ. It turns out that this threshold can be a lower bound or an upper bound, depending on parameter values and the distribution of the exchange rate. Rather than reporting lengthy equations, let us present some numerical results.

                         due to Assumption 2. The region denoted by oblique lines shows when HQ is located in country R, while the region denoted by horizontal dotted lines shows when HQ is located in country S. It is notable that for small transfer prices, only extremely risk-taking HQ benefits from risk-transfer. This result weakens as the transfer price increases. This case is contrasted with that when HQ is in country R, where, as the given transfer price increases, it becomes easier to improve utility in terms of the ratio of

A more interesting finding is presented when the variability of currency risk jointly changes. The right panel of Fig. 8 shows the boundaries of these regions as the distribution of the exchange-rate changes. We consider three cases: first,

                        . These cases have the same mean but increasing variances. The graph shows that when HQ is in country R, the region becomes smaller so that increasing variability induces more restrictive conditions for utility improvement. On the contrary, when HQ is in country S, the region becomes larger so that utility improvement becomes easier to achieve. The size difference of these regions implies that the alignment of HQ’s location and that of the retailer who is the risk taker is important. However, this difference diminishes and eventually disappears as the currency market becomes extremely volatile.

Before we end this section, let us derive some results that are analogous to (4.4)–(4.6). When a risk-sharing contract is considered, the utilities of the supplier and the retailer are the same as in Section 4.2. The utility of HQ, say,

The left panel of Fig. 9
                         illustrates these findings. Notice that the overall shapes are quite similar to those of Fig. 2. This suggests that a risk-sharing contract is less affected by the location-risk alignment of HQ and the retailer than a risk-transfer contract. The right panel of Fig. 9 shows possible utility improvements when the transfer price is greater than

                        . A similar argument as in Section 4.2 applies.

We studied risk-transfer and risk-sharing contracts used for currency-risk management in a decentralized and risk-averse supply chain of a multinational firm. In particular, this supply chain has a retailer and a supplier that are located in different countries and thus their profits are calculated in different currencies. In addition, HQ has a risk appetite that differs from that of local divisions. We chose to work on these two types of contracts because they present different styles of risk management: A risk-transfer contract (currency option in our analysis) transfers risk to a third party (possibly at some cost) and a risk-sharing contract rearranges currency risk within the chain. We investigated the conditions under which the mean–variance utilities of the members of a supply chain improve when risk management contracts are in effect.

First, as for risk-transfer, there is a condition for a risk premium of the option such that it is optimal for the retailer to enter into financial contracts as long as the option is not costly. Then, we examined the impact of this optimal retailer decision on HQ’s utility and found it to be related to the ratio of the risk preference parameters of the retailer and HQ. We numerically demonstrated that utility improvements can be achieved for a wide range of transfer prices. We next turned our attention to risk-sharing. As in risk-transfer, it is possible to improve the divisional and HQ utilities by rearranging currency risk between members. However, the conditions to achieve such improvements are different from those in risk-transfer. For instance, in risk-sharing, the relation between the risk preference parameters of the retailer and supplier becomes important too. In addition, there are cases where utility improvements are possible in risk-sharing but not in risk-transfer and vice versa. One notable feature of risk-sharing is that channel coordination is feasible in the sense that a retailer’s optimal action also results in the optimal order quantity for HQ. What makes this case possible is the risk preference parameters and a transfer price in a suitable domain, which is specified analytically.

We considered the possibility of jointly using the two types of risk transfer methods. Our interesting and somewhat counterintuitive finding is that once the utility improvements of all the members in a supply chain are not feasible with one method, using the other type of contract in addition does not necessarily change the situation. Hence, the impact of the joint usage of these contracts may not be significant in facilitating the improvement of all utilities. In addition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis and comparative statics with respect to exchange-rate variability and HQ’s location. While the increased variability generally makes utility improvements more restrictive, the outcomes seem to exhibit more complicated dynamics in risk-transfer than in risk-sharing. On the other hand, regarding the alignment of HQ’s location and the risk-taking retailer, we find that the range of risk preference parameters for HQ’s utility improvement significantly changes in risk-transfer. However, in risk-sharing, the shape of such a range remains quite similar with respect to the location change.

Based on these results, we obtain several important insights for the operational managers of multinational firms who consider risk management contracts such as risk-transfer and risk-sharing to deal with currency risk in a risk-averse supply chain. First, utility improvements can be achieved with both types of contracts. Such improvements can be achieved relatively easily through risk-transfer as long as hedging costs or the risk premiums of the options are not prohibitive. However, if further conditions are met, risk-sharing can improve all the utilities, which cannot be achieved through risk-transfer. Second, coordination of optimal order quantities in a risk-averse supply chain can be attained for a suitably chosen transfer price in the benchmark case only if the HQ is more risk-averse than the retailer. If the HQ is less risk-averse, such coordination can still be achieved with an appropriately designed risk-sharing contract. Third, jointly using those two types of contracts does not necessarily increase the likelihood of utility improvements. Considering the cost of managing two contracts together, it may not be worth implementing in practice. Fourth, if HQ considers relocating from one country to another, risk management with risk-transfer appears to be more affected by this decision than with risk-sharing. Finally, when the transfer price is determined, in addition to other incentives and legal restrictions, a manager may want to consider its effects on the utilities of all members together with the risk management methods implemented.

There are several interesting extensions to this paper. First, in addition to exchange-rate uncertainties, it is natural to also consider demand uncertainties. We expect that the correlation of demand and exchange rate uncertainty would have an impact on the risk-averse retailer’s ordering decision. One could also investigate whether channel coordination can be achieved for a decentralized supply chain under demand risk and currency risk. Second, it would be interesting to see how the result changes under other utilities, e.g. the downside-risk utility. Our preliminary analysis shows that while the structure of our results may not change significantly under the downside-risk utility, the ordering decision depends more heavily on the distributional properties, particularly heavy tails, of exchange rate under downside risk utility than under the mean–variance utility. Third, our model could be extended to models with operational hedging, including switching, postponing, and other production flexibilities. Furthermore, it would be intriguing to develop a unified model for risk management activities for currency risk, jointly including risk-transfer, risk-sharing, and operational hedging.
