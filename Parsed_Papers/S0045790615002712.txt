@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recent technological trends such as cloud computing, wireless communication, and wireless sensor networks provide a strong infrastructure and offer a true enabler for health information technology (HIT) services over the Internet. With the increasing popularity of mobile devices and development of wireless communication network technologies, more and more studies integrate mobile devices and context-aware technology for developing healthcare service platforms to support personalized health management to enhance the effectiveness of preventive medicine [1]. In addition, there have been more and more studies on applications of mobile communication technology, context-aware technology, and wireless sensor networks to Healthcare service [2]. Despite its great potential, more research is still needed as to how to effectively integrate these IT technologies and apply them to healthcare service.

In light of the advancement of HIT and communication technologies, many organizations have provided much on-line medical information available for general public. Specifically, more and more people use the information for personal health care management or patient-oriented decision making [1]. Through the on-line social media, people connect with others who have the same disease or condition, and track and share their own experiences. Many studies have shown that such effects influence the patient-physician relationship, as patients tend to become empowered as active participants in the health care decision-making process [3], especially those living with one or more chronic illness [4]. However, the information relevant to the patient’s concern is usually scattered across many different web sites. It is, therefore, difficult for patients to find reliable healthcare information with the number of site and information source choices increasing and the overwhelmingly large volume of data to review. Furthermore, from the research on mobile health conducted by the Pew Research Center since 2010, it is found that integrating mobile devices in health information landscape nowadays is a trend, especially in groups of young people [5]. Through a wide variety of smart mobile devices (iPhone, Android, Blackberry, iPad, etc.) users can download or browse large quantities of health information anytime, anywhere, and thus the intention of people to use the Mobile web to assist self-health management has increased.

With this in mind, this study proposes a framework which integrates Cloud Computing, Wireless Communication, and Wireless Sensor Networks technology, and applies a Collaborative Filtering (CF) technique to develop a Mobile Health Information Recommendation service to help users to obtain their preferred health information more efficiently. Bobadilla et al. [6] argue that the recommendation system has proved to be a useful tool to process Internet information overload phenomenon, and can effectively reduce problems caused by an excessive amount of information. The study enhances the effectiveness of receiving health information by the user and develops two health information recommendation service functions: physiological indicators-based recommender and collaborative recommender.

After a brief introduction in Section 2 on the background to this paper, our system framework and functions for the development of Mobile Health Information Recommendation service is introduced in Section 3. In Section 4, the approach used by the proposed scheme of Grid Wireless Sensor Networks is described, then its performance efficiency is evaluated. The implementation of the collaborative recommender and the physiological indicators-based recommender are discussed in Section 5. The usability of the system is evaluated in Section 6. Discussion and conclusions follow in Sections 7 and 8.

In recent years, mobile health information systems have been integrated with ubiquitous wireless communication technology to capture physiological signals and symptom information. These data are collected by mobile sensors and transmitted to a remote server for analysis. Then the results of analysis are sent to the user as the feedback for treatment or a health care reminder. Deng et al. argues that mobile health service is to provide health care, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring services through a mobile device [7].

Some researchers argue that the purpose of a mobile health service system is to provide medical and health care services to professionals so that their work can be better supported. As for the average consumers, mobile health information services allow them to obtain useful health information and guidance to achieve better health self-management [7]. Through the use of mobile health information services, healthcare administrators can enhance their management system, thereby reducing operating costs. The rising number of chronic diseases nowadays has become an increasingly heavy burden for health care organizations. The remote home health monitoring will help reduce health care costs [8] of constantly monitoring the health status of patients with chronic illness. In particular, via mobile health information services, it is possible to provide remote health monitoring with low cost and improved efficiency [8]. In addition, mobile health applications have become increasingly widespread, such as developing the health system to providing diabetes health education information, as well as encouraging users to talk to physicians through the mobile information system [9].

Nowadays, the health information landscape tends to integrate mobile device applications [5]. Through a variety of smart mobile devices, users can download or read a large quantity of health information to assist health self-management. Therefore, this study integrates mobile devices, context-aware technology, and collaborative recommendation algorithms to develop a health care system. The major application of this system is as a daily health care information recommendation service. The target subjects are young people. It is hoped to assist users of this system to pay more attention to preventive health care and health self-management.

The present system is based on the cloud computing environment, integrating mobile communication technology, context-aware technology, and wireless sensor networks to build a cross-platform for the Mobile Web for Personalized Health Information service. The health information database of this study is from one online electronic health information resource in Taiwan and is used as testing data. Since the database must store a large amount of health information and perform real-time dynamic recommendation calculations, the system is set up in the cloud VMware Workstation in order to ensure computing performance of the system. By doing so, multiple users may share a virtual machine and the effectiveness of searching for online health information will be improved. The database adopted MySQL, and uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and jQuery as the main programming languages.

The Mobile Web for Personalized Health Information service established by the study obtains the effect of a cross-platform through Mobile Health Information Recommendation service application (APP) by PhoneGap packing. It can be used in tablets or cellphones whether the operating system is iOS, Android, Windows Phone or some other. The functions of the personalized health information service of the study include the collaborative recommender and the physiological indicator-based recommender. It is expected that this will provide users with health information service under different conditions. First, the collaborative recommender is mainly based on preferences and needs of users to apply the FRSA (Fusion of Rough-set and Average-category-rating) algorithm to calculate and recommend health information to the user. On the other hand, the physiological indicator-based recommender is mainly based on the user’s physiological indicators to recommend health information. This feature is combined with other physiological indicator measuring devices such as blood pressure monitors, weight meters, pulse and blood oxygen meters, heart rate monitors, etc. to transmit physiological data signals to the cloud database records via wireless sensor networks. The system would then recommend health information matching their physiological needs to users based on pre-established rules of reasoning.

In order to understand performance of the system and responses of users, this study further conducted experimental tests of usability on the prototype system. It was found that the subjects have positive responses towards the recommendation service of this system as detailed in 6.2 Usability Analysis. However, the experimental test procedures reveal that sensors for physiological indicator measuring devices draw heavily on power during signal transmission. Insufficient power would affect the validity of the recommended outcome. In order to improve the efficiency of signal transmission from sensors of physiological indicator measuring devices to physiological indicator-based recommender and to reduce sensor node power costs, we further propose a hybrid predictive model, which combines the Grey Theory and Markov chain to predict a moving object’s path. The system determines the sleeping and waking schedules for each sensor node. This will decrease the cost which arises from tracking errors and prolong the network’s lifetime. The simulation analysis results are discussed in 4.2. The detailed description of the structure of the system environment is shown in Fig. 1
                        .

In this study, the proposed recommendation system has five components: a cloud computing based database; the hybrid predictive model of PEGASIS; a web based user interface; a health information query module; a collaborative recommender; and a physiological indicator-based recommender. The functions of each component are described below.
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 Cloud computing-based database – The system uses virtualizes and cloud of VMware to build a cloud server. It stores a large volume of health knowledge provided by a Taiwan health and medical information portal, recommendation system user profile, rough-set-based prediction [10] generated matrix table and a physiological indicator database. The user profile and rough-set-based prediction generated matrix table mainly support the computing process of collaborative recommender. The data for physiological indicator database is mainly received from a multi-interface biomedical modular platform [11] and physiological measurement devices by mobile devices. The multi-interface biomedical modular platform sends physiological data to Mobile Health Information Recommendation System via smart phones equipped with WiFi wireless or 3G communication. The platform also connects physiological measurement modules with embedded Android devices or smart phones using communication interfaces e.g. serial cables, Bluetooth communication, or ZigBee wireless communication [11,12]. An interface-independent uplink and downlink packet communication protocol is established to monitor vital signs, such as pulse and blood oxygen, blood pressure, respiration, and body temperature. Related physiological data is stored in the physiological indicator database to support the health recommendation computing process of physiological indicator based recommender. The cloud database runs on a cloud-computing platform with many benefits (please see [13] for detail discussion).


                                 The hybrid predictive model of PEGASIS – In order to enhance the performance efficiency of a prediction model, we improved Fuemmeler’s scheme. We used the Grey Theory to predict the target tracking path in each grid. Then the Markov chain was used to calculate the probability of targets appearing in each grid. To increase the accuracy of tracking the target path, we then calculated the position of the targets that appeared in each sensor node. Our scheme can predict a more accurate position of the targets that appear in each sensor node. Hence, the number of active nodes and the energy consumption of the scheme will be decreased noticeably so that the network life will be prolonged. The detailed flow is described in Section 4.


                                 Web-based user interface – Patients use the interface to search useful health information. Through an internet-based visual interface, users can receive the results of health recommendations from the collaborative recommender and the physiological indicator-based recommender more easily. It was developed using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and PhoneGap techniques so that users are able to use the system to query the health information anytime, anywhere, and via any device (e.g. desktop computer, laptop computer, iPad, Smartphone, etc.).


                                 Classified Health information query module – The health information query feature is presented as a way of subject classification; users can select a subject classification menu according to their needs and search and browse the health information that they are interested in. Users can query health information by clicking on classified items, such as drugs and health products, diseases and conditions, first aid, health diet, children and teens’ health, women’s/men’s health, and seniors’ health.


                                 Collaborative recommender – The health information recommendation feature is based mainly on users’ profile and usage records. Health information that conforms to user preference is automatically recommended through association rules and the FRSA (Fusion of Rough-set and Average-category-rating) algorithm. The feature helps users to filter extensive health information and effectively obtain the health information that meets their interest. It applies the FRSA algorithm proposed by Su et al. [10] to calculate and recommend health information matching the user’s preferences. Through this service function, users can not only access content of consistent information, but also dramatically reduce information searching time. The detailed flow is described in Section 5.1.


                                 Physiological indicator-based recommender – The physiological indicator-based recommender is based mainly on physiological indicators of the user to recommend health information. The module uses the physiological indicator data base provided by multi-interface biomedical modular platform (e.g. blood pressure monitors, pulse and blood oxygen meters, etc.) [11], and physiological measurement devices (e.g. weight meters, pulse and heart rate monitors, etc.) to recommend health information. Physiological indicators collected by the physiological indicator database can support the physiological indicator-based recommender to run the recommendation computing process so health information conforming to users’ physiological needs is recommended to users. The detailed flow is described in Section 5.2.


                                 Web service management web site – This feature is network-based system operation interface. It is the basic feature of back-end management of the system, including basic functions such as maintenance of user’s basic information, user registration management, and system management.

In [14], Fuemmeler et al. proposed a scheme which is based on a Markov chain. It assigns sleep time to each sensor node according to probability. The probability is computed by the Markov chain: the now event position is related with the past event position. The next time event position can be predicted by the Markov chain. The authors assume the target will finally leave this network. There are, in total, (n
                     +1) states. A probability transition matrix p is used to compute the probability of the target position.

                     where 
                        
                           Z
                        
                      is a 
                        
                           n
                           ×
                           n
                        
                      matrix.

This will generate a large amount of calculation and the size of each grid becomes too large. As a result, it causes a higher tracking error rate. To enhance the performance efficiency of the prediction model, the Fuemmeler’s scheme was improved. The Grey theory was used to predict the target’s tracking path in each grid. Thus, the Markov chain was used to first calculate the probability of targets appearing in each grid. To increasing the accuracy of target tracking path, the position of targets appearing in each sensor node was then calculated. Because the scheme could predict the more accurate position of targets appearing in each sensor node, the number of active nodes and the energy consumption of this scheme will be decreased tellingly so that the network life will be prolonged.

A hybrid predictive model is proposed which combines Grey theory and Markov chain to predict an object’s moving path. The system determines the sleep and wakeup schedules for each sensor node. This will decrease the cost which arises from the tracking error and prolongs the network lifetime. The flowchart diagram of the hybrid predictive model of PEGASIS architecture is shown in Fig. 2
                        .

The proposed scheme could be divided into three phases: grid chaining phase of PEGASIS architecture; predict the object moving path phase; and determine state of the sensor nodes.
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 Grid chaining phase of PEGASIS architecture:
                              

By using grid computing in the sensing field, the sensing field could be divided into several grids.

First of all, the whole sensing field is divided into 
                                    
                                       N
                                       ×
                                       N
                                    
                                  grids by grid-chaining [15].

In grid-chaining phase, there are four steps to determine the grids.
                                    
                                       (A)
                                       Setup grid step:

The quantity of grid will be set up first, for example, the setup of the quantity of.


                                          
                                             
                                                N
                                                ×
                                                N
                                             
                                           grids.

Grid deployment step:

Each network node will be evenly distributed. If the node number cannot be evenly distributed to all grids, the grid closer to the base station will have one more node.

Intra-grid chaining step:

Form chain to the nodes within the grid. A Gredy algorithm is used to form a chain for nodes within the grid, and this is called grid chain.

Inter-Grid chaining step:

Form chain between grids which is called the area chain. This follows the rule from left to right (odd row) or from right to left (even row), hence the chain will be made from first grid to last grid.


                                 Predict the object moving path phase:
                              

After the grid-chaining construct, it is assumed that each grid can connect with its neighbor grids. This ensures that each neighbor grid can transmit a message to each other. Then, we move the observation model of the target probability of appearing in the grid into the Markov chain probabilities transition matrix.

The Grey theory is used to predict in the grid which is the maximum probability of target appearing in each grid. In other words, the Grey theory is used to predict the target tracking position in the grid whose

After the prediction of probability of target appearing in each grid, the predicting range is reduced by using Grey theory. This can find the more accurate position of the target path.

After the prediction of the Grey system theory, the position of target in the grid with the maximum probability of target appearance is obtained. When the process of prediction for all target paths is complete, each sensor node’s sensing ranger is checked for whether or not it covers the target path. If the sensor node’s sensing range covers the target path, it should be an active node. If a sensor node’s sensing range is not covered by any target path, it could be a sleep node and does not perform a sensing task. We denote that 
                           
                              b
                              (
                              covered
                              )
                           
                         is a Boolean function. When the value of 
                           
                              b
                              (
                              covered
                              )
                           
                         is 1, the sensor node has covered the target path, which can be active nodes. On the other hand, when the value of 
                           
                              b
                              (
                              covered
                              )
                           
                         is 0, the sensor node has not covered any target path, so should go into sleep mode.

Only the sensor node which covers the predicted path needs to go into the active mode. Fuemmeler’s scheme is based on the grid as a unit in sleep mode, so the proposed scheme can reduce the number of active nodes, thereby reducing the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks so that the overall wireless sensor network lifetime will be prolonged.

Finally, the proposed scheme determines the sensor nodes which cover the target path to be active nodes, and the sensor nodes which do not cover the target path to be sleep nodes. As a result, the energy consumption of the proposed scheme will be decreased.

The performance efficiency of the Fuemmeler et al. proposed scheme [14] and the proposed scheme is evaluated in this section. There are three simulation situations in this section. First, the simulation is made in the context of a sensor field of 100m

                         and the number of sensor nodes is 200. As can be seen from simulation results, the novel scheme demonstrates the least amount of total energy consumption each round compared with Fuemmeler’s scheme. The proposed scheme ensures a small number of sensor nodes are active. The tracking error rate is described by

                        where n(track) is the total number of the target paths are covered and thetotalpathis the total number of the target paths. The proposed scheme could reduce the tacking error rate further than Fuemmeler’s scheme.

As illustrated in Fig. 3
                        , the proposed scheme could obtain a lower number of active nodes than Fuemmeler’s scheme in each round. Because the system needs all sensor nodes to detect the target, the predicted range is reduced by using the Grey theory so that the number of active nodes will be decreased. At the fiftieth round, the number of active nodes in our proposed scheme is 79 and in Fuemmeler’s scheme is 128.

As shown in Fig. 4
                        , the energy consumption of proposed scheme is less than Fuemmeler’s scheme in each round. Since the sleep nodes do not perform any tasks they consume no energy. At, fiftieth round, total energy consumption of our proposed scheme and Fuemmeler’s scheme are 39.5 (
                           
                              J

                         respectively.

In our proposed scheme, the Grey theory is used to predict the position of the target path after the calculation of the probability of target appears in each grid. Hence, a more accurate position than Fuemmeler’s scheme can be obtained. In Fig. 5
                        , at the fiftieth round, the tracking errors of our proposed scheme and Fuemmeler’s scheme are 0% and 5%.

The rough set algorithm directly analyzes and infers data to discover implicit knowledge and reveal potential regulations. Through a common set, the lower and upper approximation is described [18]. This is a method of data mining or knowledge discovery and has been widely applied in academic research. This method is particularly suitable for qualitative data processing and the characteristics of qualitative data of search indicators of the health information items (articles) of the knowledge base of this system. Therefore, this study uses FRSA (Fusion of Rough-set and Average-category-rating) created by Su et al. [10], integrating multiple contents, collaborative information and rough-set theory to develop collaborative health information recommendation services. The collaborative recommender is mainly based on the user’s preferences through the Collaborative Filtering approaches to recommend health information to users. We apply the FRSA (Fusion of Rough-set and Average-category-rating) algorithm proposed by Su et al. [10] to calculate and recommend health information matching the user’s preferences. The system will record characteristics of users in the cloud database and keep records of users’ health information profiles, through three tables: a user profile table; an item profile table; and a user-item matrix. The process of the algorithm has three stages: data pre-processing; users clustering; and target information prediction.


                        Stage 1. Data pre-processing – A transaction corresponds to an interest content of a user, and items in a transaction are terms extracted from its content [19]. The main task of this stage is to analyze the transactions gathered from different system users. Each transaction consisting of multiple contents and a rating that is split into three tables: a user profile table; an item profile table; and a user-item matrix. The user profile table stores the registered user’s demographic information, information searching history, and the information item corresponding with the rating score, etc. The item profile table consists of characteristics (e.g. drug name, disease type) of the information item that are easily discovered. And the user-item matrix encodes the individual preferences of users for items in a collection. The next step in this stage is to discover the user content,item content and rating score (U–I–R) relationship rules from the transaction data.


                        Stage 2. Users clustering – In this stage, the algorithm clusters the users into several groups by computing Pearson Correlation Coefficient
                        [19]. The main purpose of the clustering is to reduce the computation cost [20]. The discovered rules in Stage 1 and the clustered user-item matrices are stored in the databases. The u

                        Stage 3. Target information prediction – The prediction function starts to work from a user (called active user) who first time searches for specific health information (called target item). The target item values for the active user can be inferred by cluster determination, imputation of unknown values and target-item-value prediction [10]. The algorithm assumes that users with similar characteristics/opinions always make similar item options. Based on this assumption, the irrelevant users will be removed from the user cluster that the active user was in. Then, the algorithm determines the related user-item cluster matrix. Using U–I–R relationship rules imputes all of the unknown values in the particular matrix. Finally, through fusing rough-set-based prediction and average-category-rating calculation, the target health information (items) in the found matrix are reasoned.

Firstly, a new user needs to register to the system to use the services. The system stores the user’s demographic information and service preference (e.g. health diet) in the user profile table. When the user revisits the system to search for the pertinent health information, the collaborative recommender applies rough set-based prediction and average categorized-rating calculation to predict the user’s target information. Then, the system records the user’s browser log and uses the information for other user’s target information prediction. The recommendation process is as shown in Fig. 6
                        .

The physiological indicator-based recommender is mainly based on physiological indicators of the user to recommend health information. This feature combines with other physiological data measuring devices such as blood pressure monitors, weight meters, Pulse and Blood oxygen meters, heart rate monitors and so on. These devices have been embedded with sensors which can record and transmit physiological data signals to the database or smart mobile devices. A hybrid predictive model is proposed to enhance the signal transmission performance through wireless sensor networks and to reduce the power consumption costs of sensors. Signals of physiological data are transmitted via wireless sensor networks to the cloud database and the system will recommend health information matching their physiological indicators to the users based on pre-established rules of inference. Users can read the information of their own physiological indicators via smartphones and browse the health care information recommended by the system so that it assists the user in terms of personal health management. When the user uses physiological measuring devices for routine health management, whether they are measuring their weight, pulse, blood pressure, or blood oxygen concentration, the data can be wirelessly transmitted to the cloud database for storage via the embedded sensors in the measuring devices. Based on the rules of reasoning, the system may judge physiological indicators of users and recommend health care information to them. (see Fig. 7
                         for the system’s usage and operational processes). The system will calculate the values of physiological indicators based on data collected from different physiological measuring devices as a basis of determination of recommended health care information. The calculation of the BMI (Body Mass Indicators) as a physiological indicator is an example. When the system obtains information about the user’s height and body weight, it will calculate the BMI physiological indicator according to the BMI formula defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and then recommend health care information to the user. Whether the user is underweight (BMI<18.5), healthy (18.5⩽BMI<24), or overweight (overweight: 24⩽BMI<27, mild obesity: 27⩽BMI<30, moderate obesity: 30⩽BMI<25, severe obesity: BMI⩾35), the system will remind the user to reduce, maintain or gain weight in accordance with their weight data. Also, the system will recommend different health care information based on different degrees of obesity. When the user uses any physiological measuring device, the physiological measurement data will be transmitted through the Wireless Sensor Networks in a timely manner to the cloud database. The system will also infer and send health information to the user’s mobile phones to help the user manage their health at any time.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

The Mobile Health Information Recommendation service developed by this research is mainly to provide health care information services to users to help them to build personalized health management habits and health self-management awareness. Therefore, the system focuses on preventive health information rather than professional medical diagnosis. Target groups of this system are not limited to specific groups of patients. Instead, the general public can take advantage of the system. However, according to the research report on mobile health carried out by the Pew Research Center in 2010, the health information landscape tends to combine mobile devices, particularly among the young groups [5]. Since young adults are the main users of mobile application services, if users of this group can establish personalized health management habits and health self-management awareness, it will be beneficial to them for their personal preventive health care. Therefore, the subjects of this experiment are college students: 152 people aged between 13 and 18years and 50 people aged between 19 and 30years old; a total of 202 subjects.

The study built an online evaluation questionnaire by reviewing literature of usability evaluation [21–24] and the Health IT Usability Evaluation Model. All questionnaire items were measured using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”. Constructs of evaluation questionnaire include:
                              
                                 •
                                 User satisfaction: This refers to the evaluative and emotional responses after personally experiencing system services [21,22]. When the perception of the system services outperforms expectation, the user’s satisfaction increases accordingly; but, when the perception of the system services falls short of expectation, the user’s satisfaction decreases;

Perceived usefulness: When users perceive a function is useful, they will possibly buy and use it in the future [22];

Perceived value: When users perceive that the system service is worth paying for, the intention to use the system is high. On some occasions, it may help speeding up understanding user satisfaction and the effect of use intention [21,23]; and

Perceived trust: When users perceive the system service is trustworthy, they believe the system can reach the expected efficacy. Through user’s perceived trust, user satisfaction with the system can be increased [24].

The procedures of experiment and the operation guides of Mobile Health Information Recommendation service system, were explained to the participants and then installed in mobile phones of Android system. At the beginning, participants operated all functions of the system. Experimenters were ready to assist participants whenever it is necessary for operating the system. After the end of experiments, participants were asked to fill in the usability evaluation questionnaire.

The statistical analysis method used for this study was partial least squares (PLS), a second generation statistical technique for conducting structural equation modeling (SEM) based analysis. The partial least square is used to analyze (1) individual items, loading, mean, standard deviation; (2) composite reliability and Cronbach’s alpha; and (3) average variance extracted (AVE), discriminant validity of each aspect, and finally to analyze the response of users to usability of the recommendation function of the system. We follow the recommendation of Straub [25] and re-examine the survey instrument in terms of reliability and construct validity. The original nineteen variables initially included in the survey instrument are analyzed in PLS. Only one variable factor loading is less than .70 and has been deleted. Factor loadings of the other 18 variables are more than .70, a threshold level considered generally acceptable [25]. Table 1
                            summarizes the results for the items comprising the model.

Reliability measurements (Cranach’s Alpha) of all factors range 0.74–0.80 meet the reliability threshold 0.7. The results also show composite reliability (CR) exceeding 0.8 [25]. AVE, which can also be considered as a measure of reliability, exceeds 0.5 as recommended by [25]. Together CR and AVE attest to the reliability of the survey instrument. Calculating the correlation between variables’ component scores and individual items confirmed that intra-variable (construct) item correlations are very high compared to inter-variable (construct) item correlations attesting to the discriminate validity of the instrument. In addition, discriminate validity is confirmed if the diagonal elements (representing the square root of AVE) are significantly higher than the off-diagonal values (representing correlations between constructs) in the corresponding rows and columns. As shown in Table 2
                           , the instrument demonstrates adequate discriminate validity as the diagonal values are greater than the corresponding correlation values in the adjoining columns and rows. Overall, the instrument has achieved an acceptable level of reliability and construct validity.

Descriptive statistics indicate that all constructs were rated very positive, i.e. on average above value of Table 3
                        . The participants’ response on “Satisfaction” is the highest with score 5.4406. The second factor is “Expectation-confirmation” of 5.3927, the third is “Perceived trust” of 5.3057, the fourth is “Perceived usefulness” of 5.1386, and the last is “Perceived value” of 4.8086. Compared with other dimensions, the average response score 4.8086 of “Perceived value” is slightly lower. However, the average response score of all usability measurement dimensions is higher than 4.5. In accordance with these results, it is found that participants have a positive response to the system.

With regard to “Satisfaction,” subjects are satisfied with “Collaborative recommender” (average response score=5.4455). With the analysis results, the subjects are satisfied with “Physiological indicator-based recommender” (average response score=5.5396). Overall, subjects respond positively to the overall system structure (average response score=5.3911) and functions provided by Mobile Health Information Recommendation system (average response score=5.3861).

With regard to “Expectation-confirmation,” subjects consider “Collaborative recommender” function is better than expected (average response score=5.4604). Analysis results showed that subjects are also satisfied with “Physiological indicator-based recommender” (average response score=5.3762). Overall, subjects respond positively to the overall system structure (average response score=5.3416). Based on the analysis results, subjects believe the Mobile Health Information Recommendation service meets their personal expectations.

With regard to “Perceived trust,” subjects believe that the “Collaborative recommender” function provides health information that they need (average response score=5.2624). The analysis results show that subjects also believe that “Physiological indicator-based recommender” function can help them control physiological indicators and personal health information (average response score=5.2673). Overall, the subjects believe the system is reliable (average response score=5.3564). Subjects also show a high degree of willingness to use Mobile Health Information Recommendation system (average response score=5.3366).

With regard to “Perceived usefulness,” subjects believe the “Collaborative recommender” function helps them screen for health information they need (average response score=5.1683). The analysis results show that subjects also believe that the “Physiological indicator-based recommender” function helps them effectively control their personal physiological indicators and health information (average response score=5.2228). Overall, subjects believe that using this system can promote their personal health management (average response score=5.005), and it is effective to use the system to manage their personal health (average response score=5.1584).

With regard to “Perceived value,” subjects believe the screening function of “Collaborative recommender” for health information is valuable (average response score=4.9802). The analysis results show that subjects also believe that “Physiological indicator-based recommender” function is valuable in helping them control their physiological indicators and health information (average response score=4.6386). Overall, subjects believe that using this system to manage personal health is worthwhile (average response score=4.8069).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This study uses VMware to establish a cloud computing environment to improve the effectiveness of collaborative recommendation calculus and support the system to deal with the huge demand of real-time online health information searching by users. The system presents health information recommendation services: the collaborative recommender, and the physiological indicator-based recommender. The collaborative recommender mainly uses collaborative information and rough-set theory to develop a collaborative recommender of health information service. The function enables the dynamic real-time recommendation of health information receiving positive comments from users with similar preferences. This feature can strengthen the static keyword search by classifying keywords. In addition, the physiological indicator-based recommender combines context-aware technology and receives data of physiological indicators of users collected from other measuring devices (such as blood pressure meters, scales, and smart sports watches) via the cloud database. Also, with inference rules established from the rule-based database, it is possible to recommend health information to users that meets their needs according to their physiological indicators.

With usability evaluation results, it was discovered that subjects have positive responses towards the Mobile Health Information Recommendation system and the overall operation structure. In particular, they are highly satisfied with functions of the system. Subjects also think that the Mobile Health Information Recommendation service meets their personal expectations. In addition, subjects also believe the “collaborative recommender” and “physiological indicator-based recommender” functions meet their personal expectations. They also believe that using the “collaborative recommender” to screen for health information matching their needs is reliable and that using the “physiological indicator-based recommender” can help them control personal physiological indicators and health information. Overall, subjects highly trust the present study and the system structure. Subjects believe that using the “collaborative recommender” function can help them screen for the health information they need. Subjects also believe that using the “physiological indicator-based recommender” function can help them effectively control personal physiological indicators and health information. Overall, subjects think that using this system can promote their personal health management and it is effective to use the system to manage their personal health. From the analysis of the perceived values of subjects, it was discovered that subjects believe the “collaborative recommender” is valuable in helping them screen for the health information they need. Subjects also believe that the “physiological indicator-based recommender” is worthwhile in helping them control personal physiological indicators and health information.

The collaborative recommendation algorithm used in this study is primarily based on the FRSA (Fusion of Rough-set and Average-category-rating) algorithm to calculate and recommend health information to users that meets their needs. From the experiment results of Su et al. it is confirmed that this method can successfully reduce the gaps between the user’s preferences and the automated recommendations [10]. In addition, the study results also found that FRSA can associate the recommended items with user’s interests more effectively than other existing well-known systems in terms of accuracy. In particular, the rough-set algorithm can be used effectively in the analysis of qualitative data. This feature meets the characteristics of the data of this research, so the collaborative recommender developed by the study uses this calculation method as a basis to design a personalized health information recommendation service preferred by the user. From the usability evaluation results, it is found that subjects respond positively to this function. However, it is hoped that in the future the system can have more backend health information items for the “collaborative recommender” to provide more health information to the user. In addition, with the increase of the number of registered members, the collaborative recommendation service performance can be enhanced.

The “physiological indicator-based recommender” developed by the study combines various context-aware physiological measuring devices. Some devices must have wireless sensing functions such as wifi, bluetooth transmission, or Zeebe. Without this feature, it is impossible to achieve the effects of full calculation and automatic recommendation. However, the prototype of the system in the experimental testing phase is mainly applied in basic daily personal health information services, so the physiological measuring devices integrated in the experimental stage are mainly equipment generally used at home. In the future, there is a need to establish more diversified physiological measuring devices according to the needs of the application context to enhance the effectiveness of system services. From the usability evaluation results, it was found that subjects respond highly positively to this function. However, the experimental tests showed that the signal transmission of physiological measuring devices requires timely dynamic processing to maintain the recommendation effect of the system. However, the correctness and performance of signal transmission is affected due to limitation of battery life of current physiological measuring devices. To enhance effectiveness of signal transmission of physiological indicators measuring device sensors and to reduce power consumption costs, we further propose a hybrid predictive model, which combines the Grey theory and Markov chain to predict the moving object’s path. The system determines the sleeping and waking schedules for each sensor node. This will decrease the cost which arises from tracking errors and prolong the network’s lifetime.

Finally, in the assessment results, subjects show highly positive responses in all aspects. Related literature indicates that these aspects are important factors to predict future use intent of users. At this stage, this study only uses a usability engineering method to evaluate system usability. In the future, it would be worthwhile to research from the perspective of user behavior theory to further explore the impacts of related inter-aspects. Although subject response to perceived value of the system is relatively lower than other aspects, its appraisal value is still above 4.5, which shows that subjects have positive perceived value towards the system functions and structure. However, after analyzing why the aspect of perceived evaluation is relatively low, it might be that as the experiment was done in a laboratory, which limited the space and time of the experiment, this made it difficult for subjects to feel the application effects of the system in real-life situations. As a result, their evaluation of the system is affected. However, the system is still in the development stage of prototype. It is hoped that in future more contexts can be added to the “physiological indicator-based recommender” to promote the application of the system.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

According to the structure proposed in this study, the research further establishes functions with context-awareness, recommendation calculus, as well as personalized services. This study makes five contributions to the area of research.
                        
                           (1)
                           The Mobile Health Information Recommendation service based on cloud computing can solve the problem of massive computing and data access of the system.

The proposed scheme of Grid Wireless Sensor Networks can help in reducing the energy consumption of scheme and prolongs network life.

Through the collaborative recommender service, users can more effectively obtain consistent health information, and reduce the energy and time consumption for data search.

The physiological indicator-based recommender combines with context-aware technology to strengthen the health information referral service. With the aid of this feature, users can obtain individual physiological indicators and corresponding health information in a timely manner.

Finally, the usability responses of subjects towards this system and system computing structure via usability tests help in understanding the user satisfaction, expectation-confirmation, perceived usefulness, perceived value, and perceived trust of user in regard to the system.

However, there are some limitations to this study and they deserve further exploration in the future. Since the present study is still in the prototype development stage, experimental tests were conducted in a laboratory. In the future, various practical applications for different situations such as home care or remote medical care can be included. As for system structure, the cloud environment established by the research is a private cloud environment. If health organizations introduce a related method and structure in the future, the IT security issue of cloud environment also requires further exploration. Finally, due to constraints of time, the study cannot observe the behaviors of users of the system for a long period, or whether the system can help users establish good health management practices. These research topics are worth further exploration in the future.
