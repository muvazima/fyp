                  This paper studies a firm’s time-to-market decision and subsequent sales channel, pricing and production decisions under three main sources of uncertainty: possibility of qualifying for lucrative sales channels, competitors’ time-to-market behavior and price-sensitive uncertain demand. In particular, we consider a firm that can potentially sell through two distinct channels. Selling through the primary channel requires the firm to first get its product qualified. The secondary channel does not require qualification. Prior to market entry, the firm performs product and process design activities which improve manufacturing yield and the chances of getting qualified for the primary sales channel. A long delay in market entry allows competitors to enter the market before the firm, reducing the firm’s market share. This delay also affects the firm’s sales channel strategy. While deciding when to enter the market, the firm also needs to decide what price to charge and how much to produce at each period of a finite planning horizon. Demand distributions depend on the product’s price through general stochastic demand functions. Pricing and production decisions can be specified dynamically as a function of the state of the system and they are intertwined with the time-to-market decision. The paper provides a unified model that captures the key relationships and trade-offs among time-to-market, sales channel, pricing and production decisions. Explicitly modeling the linkages among these key decisions enables us to characterize and quantify their joint role in profit generation. This paper provides managers with a tool and a process that can guide them in determining an optimal policy for market-timing, pricing and production decisions that maximize firms’ expected profits.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A firm’s profitability depends, to a large extent, on determining the right time to market its product, the right sales channel to sell through, the right price to charge and the right quantity to produce during the product’s life cycle given the uncertainties in the development process, demand and competitor behavior. This paper studies the decisions faced by a firm that develops a new product (such as hard disk drives) that is integrated to the firm’s key customers’ product line (such as a personal computer, or a mainframe). To be a qualified supplier, the firm is required to go through stringent tests to ensure manufacturing process integrity and fit for the customer’s end product within a qualification time window. The customer tests the product for performance and manufacturing integrability; audits the firm’s production sites as well as its suppliers; and verifies whether the firm is ready for mass production. Demand realized through this channel constitutes the firm’s primary sales channel. The firm can also sell its product through distributors that do not require qualification. Demand from such distributors constitutes the firm’s secondary sales channel. This paper studies such a firm’s key decisions and trade-offs in deciding an optimal time to market its product, sales channel mix, pricing, and production decisions.

The market timing decision during an arduous product development process depends on whether the firm should invest more time in manufacturing process design and improvement or push the product to market before competitors. This trade-off impacts various profit drivers and functional areas within a firm. From the marketing perspective, early entrance to market translates into a large market share. Depending on the success of the product, a dynamic pricing strategy can be used to increase revenue. From the manufacturing perspective, delaying market entry results in higher production yields and lower costs. The time window prior to market entry is the opportune time to improve manufacturing yields. From the research and development perspective, process improvement activities resulting from minor tweaks in product design increase the likelihood of getting the product qualified per the customer’s stringent requirements. Only the qualified firm can sell its product to key customers, which constitute the firm’s primary sales channel. However, a long delay may cause the firm to miss the qualification window altogether. Unqualified product can only be sold through a secondary channel, which is often used to salvage product development efforts. From the accounting and finance perspective, the opportunity cost of building and carrying the new product is weighed against not entering the market at all. To better manage these trade-offs, we provide an integrated framework and policy for optimal dynamic time-to-market, sales channel, pricing and production decisions.

Several suppliers of key components from various industries face these trade-offs. Our study was originally motivated by our close collaboration with Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (currently known as HGST). The company recruited us to help them streamline their new product introduction processes and develop a tool to quantify the impact of related decisions on profitability. To do so, together with HGST we identified key tradeoffs associated with their market timing, sales channel, pricing, and production decisions. Hitachi Global Storage Technologies had a well-established place in the hard disk drive industry. It was founded in 2003 and was formed as a result of the strategic merger of IBM’s global storage technology business. In 2012, Western Digital acquired HGST, while keeping the brand name intact. At the time of our engagement, HGST produced hard disk drives for all three of mobile computer, desktop computer and server segments. In each segment, HGST had three to ten product families. Each product family had one to five product lines. HGST mainly manufactured two types of products: generic hard drives and custom drives. Generic hard drives were sold to multiple customers, including manufacturers and distributors. For these products, the prevailing market determined prices that were paid for generic hard drives. Custom drives were sold to specific group of customers for whom the product was specifically developed. Custom drives were sold through both primary (if qualified) and secondary channels. The company had some flexibility in setting prices and adjust them over the product’s life cycle. This paper focuses on a custom component sold through two channels and the firm that produces it has the flexibility to set prices throughout the product’s life cycle. We refer the reader to the case study on HGST by Özer (2009) and Özer and Uncu (2013) for a detailed account of challenges faced in introducing a new hard-disk drive to market. We remark that suppliers of key components from various industries from telecommunication, semiconductors, to automative, face similar trade-offs (see, for example, Gerling, Preussger, and Wulfert, 2002). We occasionally refer to the above case only to help conceptualize the trade-offs.

From the research and development perspective, a firm that invests more time in manufacturing process design prior to market entry is more likely to qualify and satisfy the customer’s requirements. Hence, firms in various industries have well structured product development procedures, check points and contingency plans. Özer and Uncu (2013) provide an extensive discussion of qualification and post-qualification production processes in the hard disk drive industry. Gerling et al. (2002) describe the qualification process and the technical requirements for semiconductor companies. Terwiesch and Bohn (2001) describe the detailed processes required to transition from pilot production runs to mass production after a firm is qualified. Although these procedures and check points reduce the uncertainty around the process of new product development, they do not eliminate it. The qualification process involves lengthy, extensive and costly procedures. Hence, the firm often has one opportunity to apply for qualification and the outcome cannot be predicted in advance. Missing the qualification time window or failing to qualify is a possibility.

From the marketing perspective, when introducing a new product the primary goals are establishing market share, relationships with the customer and effective pricing policies. In addition, the firm may establish a secondary sales channel that does not require qualification. This secondary channel is often used to salvage new product development efforts in case of an unsuccessful product qualification for the primary customer. Hence, the firm sells through two types of channels: a primary channel that requires qualification and a secondary sales channel that does not require qualification. In both channels, the firm’s market share depends on the order of market entry. Early entrants make headway in establishing relationships and contractual agreements which positively affect their market share (e.g., Lieberman and Montgemary, 1988). Hence, the order of entry into a market is inversely related to market share (e.g., Özer and Uncu, 2013; Robinson, 1988; Urban, Carter, Gaskin and Mucha, 1986). Note, however, that it is not obvious how the firm can use the early entrant market share advantage because competitors’ time-to-market decisions are almost always uncertain. Hence, marketing divisions tend to favor early entry. Nevertheless, the firm can obtain some information about the likelihood of competitors’ time-to-market through trade show information, analyst reports and past competitive behavior (e.g., Bayus, 1997). As a result, the firm often has some information about the likelihood of a competitor entering the market. For some products (such as custom hard drives), the firm can also dynamically adjust prices in response to available inventory, uncertain demand and remaining product life. Such pricing and revenue management practices are known to improve profits significantly (Özer and Phillips, 2012; Talluri and van Ryzin, 2005).

From the manufacturing perspective, the firm needs to establish production processes, prepare facilities for production ramp up, improve manufacturing yields for profitability prior to market entry and decide on how much and when to produce during the life of the product. Prior to market entry, the firm improves manufacturing yields through better manufacturing process design that allows faster assembly, less manual labor, fewer parts and lower overhead costs. The firm builds prototypes, tests them for any assembly issues, checks performance and manufacturing related issues and prepares the facilities for the qualification and production process. For example, in the hard disk drive industry, the manufacturing yield improves if more time is allocated to manufacturing process design prior to market entry. Similar yield improvements prior to market entry are observed in various industries from pharmaceutical industry and information technology (Pisano, 1996; Sambamurthy and Subramani, 2005). This improvement is due to accumulative learning experiences prior to mass production, widely known as learning-before-doing. After market entry, the firm ensures effective transition and replication of processes and yield achievements from pilot runs to actual production. During actual production, the yield also improves because accumulated experience in manufacturing processes reduces costly errors. This improvement is referred to as learning-by-doing, and is also empirically observed in industries such as semiconductor, automobile assembly, chemical processing and hard disk drive manufacturing (Hatch and Mowery, 1998; Lieberman, 1984). Given imperfect yield and uncertain demand, the firm needs to decide how much and when to produce.

Developing a new product requires several years starting from concept design to initiating mass production. During this time, the firm faces numerous decisions from product portfolio selection, product design, investment decisions, supplier and production site selection to manufacturing process design and so on. This paper cannot and does not aim to study all trade-offs and decisions involved in new product development. Instead, we focus on the final stage of product development just before mass production. This stage is sometimes referred to as launch readiness. The firm freezes majority of design related decisions before this final stage. During launch-readiness stage, final revisions to execution plans are made before market introduction. For example, Hitachi GST fills out a cross-functional checklist database to ensure proper progress is made in all aspects of manufacturing process design and qualification readiness. Prototypes of the product are produced in small and large volumes and tested for any issues in manufacturing and assembly processes. During this time window, cross-functional business analysis teams study the aforementioned trade-offs and data from various functions (as summarized in Fig. 1
                     ) to support the market timing decision. Cross-functional meetings are held where marketing and manufacturing teams present their analysis results. Based on these meetings, the firm decides market timing. This timing decision impacts the firm’s pricing, sales channel and production related decisions and hence, the resulting expected profit. Our aim is to develop a tool to quantify the impact of these decisions on profitability and use this tool to optimize related decisions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

In addition to the references mentioned so far, we bring together three distinct literature streams to study the aforementioned dynamics and profit drivers. They are (i) the literature on pricing, (ii) the literature on production and inventory control under imperfect yield, and (iii) the literature on dynamic new product introductions. Each of these streams is rich and extensive. Hence, we briefly review a few related work and refer the reader to excellent reviews.

Pricing literature has shown that firms can increase profits by adjusting prices as a function of available inventory and remaining sales periods (Bitran and Mondschein, 1993; Gallego and van Ryzin, 1994). The earlier works of Ernst (1970),Zabel (1972) and Thowsen (1975) show the optimality of a base-stock list-price policy for periodic review joint pricing and inventory control problem under various conditions on costs and demand distributions for lost sales and backlogging cases. Federgruen and Heching (1999) build on these papers to show that this optimality result holds under general price-dependent demand functions for inventory problems with linear ordering cost and backlogging. Li and Zheng (2006) build on this paper to study joint pricing and inventory decision under uncertain yield. They show that optimal policy is a threshold type and that the introduction of yield variability causes the solution to lose its base-stock structure, as well as the list price structure. Dong, Kouvelis and Tian (2009) study dynamic pricing and inventory control of substitutable products. Zhu (2012) extends the classic joint pricing and inventory control problem to account for returns and expediting. We refer the reader to Aviv and Vulcano (2012) and Chen and Simchi-Levi (2012) for a comprehensive review of the related papers. They also provide an excellent tutorial on the state of the art in dynamic list pricing and joint pricing and inventory management. We contribute to the pricing literature by incorporating the time-to-market decision and characterizing the impact of post-entry pricing and production decisions on the time-to-market decision and vice-a-versa. For example, we show that, despite uncertain yields, the optimal post-entry pricing and production policy is a state-dependent base-stock list-price policy when the firm is mandated to deliver only functioning products to the customer. We also show that the optimal base-stock level and list price should be revised based on the firm’s time-to-market decision, the qualification outcome and hence the sales channel choice. Conversely, when demand price sensitivity increases, the firm’s optimal list price decreases, squeezing the profit margin. Hence, in an effort to maintain profit margin, we show that the firm should optimally enter the market late to improve yield and reduce production cost.

Almost all manufacturing systems in practice face imperfect yields. Hence, several researchers have been interested in establishing effective manufacturing policies for such systems. Yano and Lee (1995) provide a comprehensive review of the earlier literature. Parlar and Wang (1993), and Parlar, Wang, and Gerchak (1995) are among the first group to study the replenishment problem with multiple suppliers with uncertain yield. More recently, Kutzner and Kiesmller (2013) study production policies for a periodic review production system with uncertain yields that depend on the state of the production system. Dong, Kouvelis and Tian (2009) study performance of contingency responses, such as emergency production and expedited shipping, of a firm who procures from suppliers with uncertain yield. Recently, Kazaz and Webster (2011) build on Kazaz (2004) model that assumes exogenous selling prices, and show how yield-dependent cost affects the optimal selling price and production quantity under supply uncertainty. The present paper studies the complementary problem in which the firm sells through two sales channels with different qualification and price requirement. In other words, the present paper studies the supplier’s problem in the aforementioned literature. Our paper also contributes to this literature by focusing on imperfect yield and studying the impact of yield improvement due to learning-before-doing and learning-by-doing on the optimal time-to-market, pricing and production decisions.

A final stream of research investigates time-to-market decisions and their impact on profits in dynamic environments. For example, Terwiesch and Bohn (2001) focus on yield improvement during production ramp up. They characterize the trade-off between the short term costs of learning and its long term benefits. Souza, Bayus, and Wagner (2004) study an infinite horizon problem in which a firm periodically makes product timing and quality decisions based on competitor market entry decisions and price erosion rate. Li and Zhu (2009) study the role of acquiring forecast information in new product introductions. Li, Graves, and Rosenfield (2010) study the option of product substitution as a hedge against demand–supply mismatch during a product transition. Building on this work, Li and Graves (2012) show how pricing can similarly be used as a hedge against this mismatch. Recently, Özer and Uncu (2013) study dynamic time-to-market decisions in connection with post-entry production decisions. We build on and extend their work in two important ways: (1) We consider a general stochastic, price-sensitive demand during each sales season. The firm can set and dynamically adjust prices during the planning horizon. (2) The firm, in our case, can sell its product through multiple channels over multiple periods. The firm decides which channel to sell its product and what price to charge depending on the channel choice and qualification outcome. The present paper contributes to this literature by integrating the firm’s stochastic time-to-market, pricing and production problem in a dual sales channel environment. Doing so enables us to understand and quantify the impact of pricing and production decisions on the time-to-market decision. We show, for example, adjusting prices optimally mitigates the risk of entering the market early or late. We also study the role of the secondary sales channel on timing, pricing and inventory decisions. An auxiliary result is that we provide a method in our proofs to characterize optimal policies for large scale optimal stopping problems.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 3, we describe the elements of our model. In Section 4, we formulate the two stage stochastic decision problem. In Section 5, we characterize an optimal dynamic time-to-market policy as well as the optimal combined production and pricing policy. In Section 6, we provide managerial insights regarding profit improvement due to the optimal dynamic time-to-market strategy. In Section 7, we conclude.

There are two stages in our model: the manufacturing process design stage corresponding to the final stage in new product development and the pricing and production stage corresponding to the product’s life cycle (or the finite planning horizon). The decision time frame during the process design stage is given by the qualification time window. During this first stage, the firm decides when to stop process design for qualification and apply for it. The firm has one opportunity to go through the qualification process. If the firm is qualified, it can produce and sell through both the primary and secondary channels. Otherwise, it can sell only through the secondary channel. Hence, this stage is also often referred to as qualification-readiness stage. The timing decision affects the firm’s market share, price-dependent stochastic demand, the likelihood of qualification and the manufacturing yield during the sales and production periods. During this second stage, the firm decides what price to charge for its product and how much to produce during each sales period throughout the life of the product so as to maximize its expected profit.


                     Competitive position: To model competitors’ behavior, the process design stage is divided into N periods, indexed from 1 to N, such that at most one competitor can be qualified in each period. In period n ∈ {1, …, N}, a competitor qualifies with probability pn
                      ∈ [0, 1] and no competitors qualify with probability 1 − pn
                     . Let kn
                      denote the random variable representing whether or not a competitor enters the market in period n:

                     Let v(in

                      is the total number of competitors in the market when the firm stops the process design. If the customer qualifies the firm, then in
                      indicates the firm’s rank among all other qualified firms. Note that this rank does not change regardless of how many other competitor qualifies later.

                        We remark that any number of competitors (zero or N − n) may enter after period n. At period n, the only information available to the firm is the current state of the system (not the future state), that is, the number of already qualified competitors. Effects of uncertain future are embedded in the profit functions as an expectation (e.g. in the functional form of the market share function and probability of other competitors entering the market later they are accounted for in the model). Recall from discussions in the introduction that what matters is the rank of the firm in terms of its order of market entry, i.e., first to enter, second to enter, third to enter and so on. Once the firm stops and enters the market, its rank can never change. For example, assume that two competitors were qualified before the firm and that the firm decides to enter the market, applies for qualification and gets qualified. His rank would be third to enter the market (and in
                            = 2). This rank cannot change regardless of how many other competitors enter the market later. Market share depends on this rank.
                      Entering the market after competitors affects the firm’s market share adversely: v(in
                     ) is decreasing in in
                     . We use the terms increasing and decreasing in the weak sense; i.e., increasing means non-decreasing. The realization of kn
                      during the process design stage will define how in
                      evolves over time.

                      ∈ [0, 1] denote the probability that the firm qualifies if it applies for qualification at the beginning of period n. We have qn

                     Demand model: Demand for the firm’s product depends on the decisions and uncertainties realized during the first stage when the firm makes its time-to-market decision. Hence, demand depends on the qualification outcome sn
                      and the firm’s market share v(in
                     ).Demand for the product also depends on the firm’s pricing policy during each period t ∈ {1, …T} of the product’s life cycle, i.e., the pricing and production stage. Hence, demand has the following form.

                      and note that κ(w) = 1 and τ(w) = 0 correspond to the additive and multiplicative models, respectively (see also Chen and Simchi-Levi, 2004; Federgruen and Heching, 1999). The multiplicative approach v(i)D allows one to decompose the problem of forecasting total demand from the problem of estimating market share (Phillips, 2005). Marketing analysts at Hitachi GST forecast the total demand for a product and the firm’s market share in a similar way.


                     Expected profit: The firm produces and sells the product during the pricing and production stage over a finite planning horizon. During each period t ∈ {1, …, T} of the pricing and production stage, the firm charges wnt
                      per unit demanded and incurs ct
                      per unit produced. The firm produces under imperfect yield. Each item produced is either defective or nondefective. Production cost is incurred on all items including the defective ones. Yield depends both on the time of market entry and on the period of production because of learning-before-doing and learning-by-doing. Specifically, yield is rnt
                      ∈ (0, 1] if the firm enters the market in period n of the process design stage and is producing at period t of the pricing and production stage. We assume the firm can improve yield via learning before doing; i.e., r
                     1t
                      ≤ r
                     2t
                      ≤ …rNt
                      for all t.

The firm’s expected profit depends on several factors such as the production cost, yields, prices, inventory holding and penalty costs and stochastic demand over the production horizon. Some of these factors are affected by the firm’s time-to-market decision. Therefore, the pricing and production stage problem and the resulting profit depend closely on the following three state variables: (1) the period in which the firm enters the market, n, (2) the number of competitors that enter the market before the firm, in
                     , and (3) whether the firm is qualified, sn
                     . Let Jn
                     (in, sn
                     ) be the firm’s expected profit. We will define this profit function explicitly in Section 4.2 when we formulate the pricing and production stage problem.

The framework is based on closely coupled two-stage, stochastic sequential decision problems. The first stage is formulated as an optimal stopping problem to provide an optimal time-to-market policy. The solution of the stopping problem and the resulting profit used in the formulation depend on the solution of the second stage periodic-review, pricing and inventory control problem. This second stage problem’s solution provides an optimal pricing and production control policy. Yet, its solution depends on when the firm decides to stop process design. Hence, these two stochastic optimization problems are nested and can only be solved jointly. Next, we formulate the first stage stochastic optimization problem followed by the second stage problem.

This section introduces the formulation of the dynamic program to determine the optimal time for the firm to stop the process design. The state space is given by the number of competitors that enterthe market before the firm, in
                        . Recall that the state also equivalently defines the rank of the firm among all qualified suppliers. The sequence of events is as follows. At the beginning of each period n ≤ N, the firm observes the number of already qualified competitors in the market, in
                         and decides between the following two alternatives:

                        where Jn
                        (in, sn
                        ) represents the firm’s expected profit from producing and selling the product. We will define this function explicitly in the following section. If the firm applies for qualification, then it gets qualified, i.e., sn
                         = 1, with probability qn
                        . Hence, the first term in brackets is the firm’s expected profit if it decides to apply for qualification. If the firm does not apply for qualification, then sn
                         = 0 with probability 1. Hence, the firm’s expected profit is given by the second term. Alternatively, the firm may decide not to enter the market at all. The firm chooses among these three alternatives that maximizes its profit.

We remark that the firm’s decision to apply for qualification is also its sales channel choice decision. In other words, the firm decides through which sales channel to sell its product, i.e., through both the primary and secondary sales channels, or only through the secondary sales channel, or not to sell anything at all. Once this decision is made, the outcome depends on the realization of qualification outcome, that is qn
                        , if the firm decides to sell through both channels. The firm can increase the likelihood of qualification by delaying market entry and allocating more time to process design. However, delaying time to market (or equivalently sales channel choice) decision may adversely affect the firm’s market share when other competitors act first and enter the market before the firm. Next, we formulate a dynamic program to capture this trade off and find the optimal time to stop process design.

The firm’s reward function is defined as follows. For all periods n ∈ {1, …, N},

                        . The cash flows take place during the pricing and production stage, which starts at the end of period N. Hence, the firm’s optimization problem is to maximize its expected profit at the beginning of pricing and production stage

                           One can obtain the present value of the expected profit by multiplying the expected profit with a (time-dependent) discount factor. Doing so does not affect the firm’s optimization problem and the resulting decisions. Hence, we do not include discount factors for the process design stage.

                        (in
                        ), it is optimal for the firm to delay the market entry and continue improving process design and qualification. Otherwise, it is optimal to stop the process design and decide whether to enter the market and through which sales channels to sell its product.

To be able to solve the above optimal stopping problem, here we provide an equivalent formulation. We mention in passing that this transformation makes it possible for one to solve a large scale optimal stopping problem. The importance of this approach becomes clear only if one delves into the proofs. We refer the interested reader to the proofs. We define Qn
                        (in
                        ) ≡ Bn
                        (in
                        ) − An
                        (in
                        ), and substitute Qn
                        (in
                        ) + An
                        (in
                        ) for Bn
                        (in
                        ) in Eqs. (3) and (4) and subtract An
                        (in
                        ) from both sides of these equations to obtain an equivalent formulation. The resulting dynamic programming formulation for n = 1, …, N − 1 is given by

                        (in
                        ) ≥ 0, it is optimal to continue process design; otherwise it is optimal to stop. In the following section, we model the production stage problem.

To obtain the firm’s expected profit function from stopping the process design in period n; i.e., An
                        (in
                        ) defined in Eq. (2), we need to solve the firm’s pricing and production problem. Hence, next we explicitly formulate the second stage problem and show how to embed its solution into the optimal stopping problem formulated in the previous subsection. At the beginning of each pricing and production period t ∈ {1, …, T}, the firm reviews available information and decides how much to produce, znt
                         ≥ 0, and what price to charge, wnt
                         ∈ [w
                        min, w
                        max]. The production lead time is zero. Production cost is ct
                         per unit. Only non-defective items are added to inventory. Demand is realized and satisfied through on-hand inventory if any; otherwise it is backordered. The firm charges wnt
                         per unit; incurs a holding cost ht
                         per unit of on-hand inventory and a backorder cost bt
                         per unit of backordered demand. At the end of the pricing and production stage, any remaining non-defective inventory is salvaged for c
                        
                           T + 1 per unit. Backorders are satisfied by a final production that costs c
                        
                           T + 1 per unit. All revenues and costs are discounted by α ∈ (0, 1] in each period.

The state space is given by (xnt, v(in
                        ), sn
                        ), where xnt
                         is the net inventory before production; i.e. inventory on hand minus backorders. At the end of period t, the state space is updated as

                         is the net inventory after the production decision. The net-inventory depends on production period t as well as the firm’s period of entry to the market. Note that the firm’s time-to-market and sales channel decision from previous stage affect demand for the product as well as production yields through learning-before-doing. Hence the net inventory xnt
                         is a function of the period n in which the firm decided to enter the market in addition to period t in product’s life cycle.

Based on the end-of-period net inventory, the expected holding and backorder cost charged to period t is given by

                        We define the modified unit production cost as cnt
                         ≡ ct
                        /rnt
                        , for t ≤ T + 1. We assume that bt
                         > cnt
                         − αc

                           n, t + 1 − cnt
                         for t ∈ {1, …, T − 1}; and hT
                         > αc
                        
                           T + 1 − cnT
                        . We also assume that a price charged in a given period is at least as large as the item’s replacement value in the next period: wnt
                         ≥ αc
                        
                           n, t + 1. These assumptions exclude the trivial cases where it is optimal to produce nothing and accumulate backlogs or produce infinite amounts.

The following dynamic program provides the optimal expected profit when T − t + 1 periods are left before the end of the pricing and production stage:

To solve the two-stage stochastic, nested dynamic programs formulated in the previous section, we first solve the pricing and production stage problem described in Section 4.2. We determine an optimal joint pricing and production control policy and the resulting optimal expected profit. We embed the optimal expected profit into the dynamic programming formulation of the process design stage described in Section 4.1. By solving this process design stage, we provide an optimal market timing and a sales channel policy that the firm can follow to maximize its expected profit.

This theorem shows that the optimal expected profit, optimal expected production cost and the optimal base-stock levels are proportional to the market share. This result allows us to solve the pricing and production stage problem by first solving the problem assuming that the firm has 100 percent market share, i.e., v(in
                        ) = 1. We multiply the results by the firm’s market share to obtain the corresponding profit and production policy.

                                       ) = v(in

                                       ), where jn

                                       ) ≡ V

                                       The function jn
                                       (sn
                                       ) is increasing in n.
                                    

The function jn
                        (sn
                        ) is the expected profit when the firm enters the market and captures 100 percent market share. This result states that the optimal expected profit is increasing with market entry timing if market share is unaffected. Next, we study the optimal time-to-market problem and the firm’s sales channel decision.

Recall from Eq. (2) that An
                        (in

                           Theorem 4
                           
                              The following statements are true for all n:

                                 
                                    1.

                                       ) = v(in

                                       .


                                       The function an is nonnegative increasing in n.
                                    

This theorem establishes some properties of an
                         and An
                        . Part 1 shows that the expected profit can be written as the product of two factors that favor early entry and late entry, respectively. The optimal market timing decision is the outcome of a trade-off between these two factors. On the one hand, market share v(in
                        ), and hence the demand for the product, stochastically decline over time, favoring early entry to market. On the other hand, qualification probability and manufacturing yield improve over time, favoring late entry.

Next, we turn to the dynamic programming formulation in Eqs. (6) and (7) and state the optimal stopping result. To do so, we identify the points where Tn
                        (i) crosses the zero line. For n = 1, i = 0 and therefore the decision is based on T
                        1(0). For n = 2, …, N − 1, we define Ωn
                         ≡ {0, 1, …, n − 1}, which is the set of realizable values of i at the beginning of period n. We define

This theorem shows that market timing policy has a threshold structure. Under this policy, the firm optimally stops the process design when the number of competitors in the market exceeds the threshold 
                           
                              i

                        . Next the firm decides whether to enter the market by solving Eq. (2). The decreasing differences in market share implies that as the number of competitors in the market in
                         increases, the potential market loss from not entering the market increases as well. When the number of competitors in the market exceeds the threshold

                                 n
                                 *
                              
                              ,
                           
                         the benefit of continuing process design does not meet the cost of potential market loss. Hence, it becomes optimal to stop process design. We remark that the decreasing differences condition is sufficient but not necessary. Later in the numerical section we use several market share functions that do not have decreasing differences. The policy for those cases continue to follow a threshold structure.

Part 1 shows that a higher likelihood of competitor entry results in a higher tendency to stop the process design and decide whether to apply for qualification and which sales channel to sell through. Stopping the process design earlier is justified to avoid losing market share which is more likely to be lost to competitors as the firm delays its sales channel decision. Part 2 shows that a higher likelihood of qualification also leads to a higher tendency to stop the process design earlier. If the chances of qualification are higher, the firm has less incentive to further postpone market entry to improve process design and hence increase the chances of selling through both primary and secondary channels.

Here, we investigate how a firm should optimally adjust its market-timing, pricing and production decisions with respect to varying various operating (such as yields) and market conditions (such as price sensitivity) conditions. We provide insights into the relationship among time-to-market strategy, sales channel choice, pricing and production decisions. In particular, we focus on the relation of pricing and market-timing decisions and illustrate how a pricing policy can complement time-to-market policy (e.g., enhance an effective or mitigate the adverse effect of a mis-judged time-to-market decision). The following describes the setup for the study.


                     Cost, price and yield structure. All cost parameters are stationary: ct
                      = c, ht
                      = h, and bt
                      = b. The yield function is of the form rnt
                      = 1 − e
                     −θ(n − 1) − βt
                     . The parameters θ > 0 and β > 0 represent the learning-before-doing and learning-by-doing rates, respectively. We vary θ and β to investigate the effect of learning.


                     Market share. The market share function is of the form v(i) = a − beγi
                     , where γ models the marginal loss in market share. When γ > 0 (resp., γ < 0) market share function has decreasing (resp., increasing) differences. We vary γ to investigate the overall effect of market share.

The competitor entry probability is stationary, pn
                      = p. By varying p, we investigate the impact of competitor entry. The qualification probability follows the form qn
                      = 
                        q
                      +ζn, where 
                        q
                      is the base qualification probability and ζ ∈ [0, (1 − 
                        q
                      /n] is the rate of improvement in qualification probability. Higher values of ζ correspond to scenarios where the firm improves the process design significantly every period.

In the base scenario, we use the following parameter values: μ
                     1 = 1000, σ
                     1 = 200, μ
                     2 = 200, σ
                     2 = 40, d = 20, m = 1, h = 1, b = 6, c = 3, α = 0.95, θ = 0.5, β = 0.5, γ = 0.6, p = 0.5, 
                        q
                      =0.6, and ζ = 0.025, N = 6, and T = 5. Fig. 2
                      illustrates the resulting yield and market share curves.

The optimal dynamic strategy under the base scenario is given by the optimal thresholds, which are

                     . The threshold levels for periods 1 and 2 state that it is optimal to continue the process design at least until period 3. At the beginning of periods 3 and 4, the firm checks the number of competitors in the market; if this number exceeds 1, then it is optimal to stop process design and decide which sales channel to target. At period 5, it is optimal to stop process design if the number of competitors exceeds 0. The corresponding optimal expected profit is π* = 127, 328. We remark that the threshold policy is optimal in all our numerical examples, i.e., even when v(i) does not have decreasing differences. This observation suggests the threshold policy is robust when one considers any reasonable scenario.


                     Table 1
                      reports the optimal base-stock levels and list prices corresponding to a successful qualification outcome as a function of both the period in which the firm enters the market, n, as well the sales and production period t. Here we report policy parameters corresponding to 100 percent market share. The actual policy parameters as a function of competitor behavior can be obtained by multiplying these numbers with the corresponding market share function v(in
                     ) (Theorem 2). We highlight a few key observations regarding both base-stock level and the list price. First, the base-stock level is increasing with n. If the firm delays market timing, it improves manufacturing yield due to learning before doing. Hence, it is optimal for the firm to produce less when yield is low and increase production quantity when the yield is higher. Second, the list price is decreasing as the firm delays entering the market or the firm advances to later stages of product’s life cycle. This decline in list price is also due to the improvement in manufacturing yields. We remark that the actual list-price depends on the market share and it may be higher or lower depending on the number of competitors in the market. This table shows optimal list-price corresponding to 100 percent market share, e.g., in the absence of any competitors.


                     Impact of price sensitivity: 
                     Fig. 3
                      illustrates the impact of price sensitivity m. The optimal thresholds for all periods increase with m. Here, we illustrate only 
                        
                           i
                           4

                     . This observation suggests that the firm has a higher tendency to continue process design when demand is price sensitive. Similarly, the optimal list price 
                        
                           
                              w

                              *
                           
                           
                              (

                              ,
                              1
                              )
                           
                        
                      decreases with m. Price-sensitive demand pushes the firm to reduce prices, which squeezes its profit. In an effort to maintain higher profits under price sensitive demand, the firm optimally stops process design later to increase production yield and hence, reduce production cost. The optimal profit decreases with m as well.


                     Impact of learning before doing: 
                     Fig. 4
                      shows that the optimal threshold, 
                        
                           
                              i
                              4
                              *
                           
                           ,
                        
                      decreases with θ, implying a higher tendency to stop process design. When the firm reaches high yields earlier (i.e., when θ is large), it has less incentive to further postpone market entry. Optimal list prices decrease with θ because high yields result in low production costs. Accordingly, the firm has more room to cut prices and boost demand. The optimal profit increases because of higher yields achieved due to learning-before-doing. These observations suggest that a firm that learns faster before actual production benefits more from a dynamic strategy.


                     Impact of learning by doing: 
                     Fig. 5
                      illustrates that the optimal threshold, 
                        
                           
                              i
                              4
                              *
                           
                           ,
                        
                      decreases with β, implying a higher tendency to stop process design. Larger β implies that the yield improvement during production is higher. High learning by doing compensates for low yield improvement during the process design stage. Hence, there is less benefit to continue process design. Optimal list prices decrease with higher β because higher yield levels result in low production costs. Accordingly, the firm has more room to cut prices. Note also that the optimal profit naturally improves when learning is faster.


                     Impact of likelihood of qualification or competitor entry: 
                     Fig. 6
                      illustrates that the optimal threshold, 
                        
                           
                              i
                              4
                              *
                           
                           ,
                        
                      increases with ζ, implying a higher tendency to continue process design. Intuitively, when ζ is large, process design activities are more effective and hence, stopping closer to the last period is optimal. In other words, the firm can improve its chances of selling through both primary and secondary channels. The optimal profit increases with higher ζ since the process design activities provide more improvement. Optimal list prices do not depend on qualification probability because these prices are charged after the process design stage ends, i.e., after the qualification process. The prices depend on the outcome of the qualification, not on the likelihood of qualification. Hence, we do not provide a figure for list prices as a function of qualification probability.


                     Fig. 7
                      illustrates that the optimal threshold, 
                        
                           
                              i

                           ,
                        
                      decreases with p, implying a higher tendency to stop when competitors are more likely to enter the market. The optimal profit decreases with higher p since the firm is more likely to lose market share during the process design stage. Note that optimal list prices depend on the firm’s market timing, hence, the realized number of competitors in the market. But they do not depend on the competitor entry probabilities.

This paper studies a firm’s joint time-to-market, sales channel, pricing and production policy. We show that the firm’s optimal time-to-market decision needs to be revised in real time based on the number of competitors in the market. The firm also needs to adjust its pricing and production policy in conjunction with its time-to-market decision. In particular, we establish the optimality of a threshold policy to manage time-to-market decisions. Under this policy, the firm monitors the number of competitors in the market. At the beginning of each period of the process design stage, the firm optimally stops process design if the number of competitors in the market exceeds a certain threshold. Next the firm decides through which channel to sell its product. Based on this decision, the firm applies for qualification. We also show that the firm’s optimal policy during pricing and production stage is a state-dependent, base-stock list-price policy. Under this policy, if net inventory at the beginning of each production period is below a state-dependent base-stock policy, the firm produces up to this base-stock level and charges a list-price. Otherwise, the firm optimally charges a price lower than the list-price, i.e., gives a discount, to boost demand. This pricing and production policy also depends on which channel the firm sell its products. What makes these policies intriguing and sets them apart from those encountered in the literature is that they are modeled in a unified framework to capture the intricate dependencies and trade-offs. Hence, explicitly modeling the linkages among these decisions enables us to characterize and quantify their joint role in profit generation. These policies are state-dependent in which the state is affected by the other policy. For example, the optimal list price depends on the firm’s earlier time-to-market decision/policy. A firm that enters the market late will be more likely to seek out to apply for qualification to sell through both channels. The number of competitors that enter the market prior to the firm affects the firm’s pricing decision. This paper also provides a framework to quantify how various operating and market conditions impact the optimal time-to-market, pricing and production policy and their relation with each other. For example, we show that when demand price sensitivity increases, the firm’s optimal list price decreases, squeezing the profit margin. In an effort to maintain profit margin, the firm should optimally tend to enter the market late to improve yield and reduce production cost. In summary, this paper establishes the joint role of time-to-market, sales channel, pricing and production decisions for a firm that can sell its product through multiple-sales channels.

We remark that our results are general and could be used by firms facing similar challenges. Nevertheless, per the encouragement of an anonymous reviewer, we briefly discuss here some thoughts on our close engagement with Hitachi Global Storage Technologies. The present paper and Özer and Uncu (2013) outline precisely the problem, the challenges and the dynamics that hard disk drive manufacturers were facing at the time. Most high-technology suppliers that build critical components face similar challenges. We spent several years working with HGST to refine the model’s scope for use within the company. In particular, during 2005–2008, we performed research on qualification timing and post qualification production decisions jointly with HGST. The company provided both monetary funding and management staff support. During this project, we worked with several HGST executives, managers, and engineers. Many different organizational units in HGST were closely involved in this research: Manufacturing, Product Life Cycle Management Group, Marketing and Finance, and the Product Development team. We continued this cross-functional collaboration over six project phases spanning three years. During each phase, we had three to four executive level management review meetings with the CFO, Business Planning Executive, Supply Chain Executive and SVP of Manufacturing. In addition, we had several lengthy work sessions with engineers, developers and business analysts. The teams identified key challenges and dynamics faced by Hitachi GST and the electronic storage industry in general. The groups within HGST used actual data to experiment, backtest and stress test the model under various case studies. We conclude the paper with a quote from (retired) Senior Vice President Clint Dyer, “The research and the resulting software proved to be very helpful to HGST in providing critical managerial insights for qualification timing and the subsequent production decisions. The framework and the algorithm has been available to our business analysis group as a decision tool to help us guide our timing and production decisions. The tool is also used for “What if” analysis. The framework augmented our current processes and helped us to quantify policy impacts. This research also enabled us to have data driven discussions across functional groups. We will continue to utilize such decision-making tools based on historical and predictive algorithms in the future.”

The inequality is from the convexity of [ · ]+ function and Dnt
                              (w
                              1, v(in
                              ), sn
                              ) < Dnt
                              (w
                              2, v(in
                              ), sn
                              ). We conclude that [y − Dnt
                              (w, v(in
                              ), sn
                              )]+ and hence, E[y − Dnt
                              (w, v(in
                              ), sn
                              )]+ is supermodular in y and w. Supermodularity of E[Dnt
                              (w, v(in
                              ), sn
                              ) − y]+ can be verified analogously.

Part 2 follows from Part 1 and Eq. (8), since the sum of jointly convex functions is jointly convex. Similarly, Gnt
                               is supermodular.

To prove Part 3, we first fix values of random variables 
                                 
                                    D

                                    1
                                 
                               and 
                                 
                                    D
                                    t
                                    2
                                 
                               and prove strict concavity of (w − cnt
                              )Dnt
                              (w, v(in
                              ), sn
                              ). To do so, note that Dnt
                               is linear in w and hence, it possesses constant first derivative and zero second derivative with respect to w.

The equality is from taking derivatives twice. The inequality is because Dnt
                               is strictly decreasing in w. Since concavity is preserved under expectation (w − cnt
                              )EDnt
                              (w, v(in
                              ), sn
                              ) is strictly concave in w as well.

                              . In the last equality, the first term depends on wnT
                               but not on ynT

                               is from Lemma 1, Part 3. The second term is jointly concave since E[ynT

                               from Part 1. Hence, the optimal price wnt

                              ), sn
                              ) is submodular, Hence, the optimal price wnt
                              (xnt, v(in
                              ), sn

                              ) is increasing in n. More generally, we prove by induction that for given s, t and x, Vnt

The second and third equalities follow from Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively. From Part 3 for n + 1, the term in (1) is decreasing in i. The term in (2) is decreasing in i as proved above. This completes the proof of Part 1 for n, concluding the induction argument and the proof.

To prove Part 1, we first prove by induction that Bn
                              (i) is decreasing in i. To prove BN
                              (i) is decreasing, note from Eq. (3) and Theorem 4, Part 1 that BN
                              (i) = AN
                              (i) = v(i)aN
                               and recall that v(i) is decreasing in i. Next, suppose that B
                              
                                 n + 1(i) is decreasing. We have, Bn
                              (i) = max {Hn
                              (i), v(i)an
                              }.Hn
                              (i) = pnB
                              
                                 n + 1(i + 1) + (1 − pn
                              )B
                              
                                 n + 1(i) is decreasing in i by inductive assumption. v(i)an
                               is also decreasing in i. This completes the proof that Bn
                              (i) is decreasing in i for all n.

Next, we show that Tn
                              (i) is decreasing in pn
                               for any i and n ≤ N − 1. To do so, we show that Tn
                              (i, p
                              1) ≤ Tn
                              (i, p
                              2) for any pn
                               = {p
                              1, p
                              2} ∈ [0, 1] with p
                              1 > p
                              2. Substituting Hn
                              (i) as defined in Eq. (5), we have Tn
                              (i, p) = pB
                              
                                 n + 1(i + 1) + (1 − p)B
                              
                                 n + 1(i) − v(i)an
                              . Hence, Tn
                              (i, p
                              1) − Tn
                              (i, p
                              2) = (p
                              1 − p
                              2)(B
                              
                                 n + 1(i + 1) − B
                              
                                 n + 1(i)) ≤ 0. The inequality holds because p
                              1 > p
                              2 and B
                              
                                 n + 1(i) is decreasing in i as proved above. Hence, from its definition in Eq. (13), 
                                 
                                    i

                               is decreasing in pn
                              .

To prove Part 2, we first show that Tn
                              (in
                              ) is decreasing in qn
                              . To do so, we show that Tn
                              (in, q
                              1) ≤ Tn

                              2) for any qn

                              2. We also define an
                              (q) as in Eq. (12) with qn
                               = q. From An
                              (in

                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) ≤ 0 in each.

Case I: When an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = (a) − (d): Since (a) is the outcome of the first maximization above, we must have jn
                              (1) ≥ jn
                              (0). We have, an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = (q
                              2 − q
                              1)(jn
                              (1) − jn
                              (0)) ≤ 0 because q
                              1 > q
                              2 and jn
                              (1) ≥ jn
                              (0).

Case II: When an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = (a) − (e): Since (a) is the outcome of the first maximization above, we must have jn
                              (1) ≥ jn
                              (0). Since (e) is the outcome of the second maximization above, we must have jn
                              (0) ≥ jn
                              (1). Therefore, we have jn
                              (1) = jn
                              (0). Hence an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = q
                              2(jn
                              (1) − jn
                              (0)) = 0.

Case III: When an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = (a) − ( f): Since (a) is the outcome of the first maximization, we must have (a) ≥ 0. We prove that (a) ≤ 0 as well to conclude that (a) = 0. To do so, first note that we must have q
                              1
                              jn
                              (1) + (1 − q
                              1) jn
                              (0) ≤ 0 and jn
                              (0) ≤ 0 because (f) is the outcome of the second maximization above. There are two subcases to consider for jn
                              (1).

Case (i): When jn
                              (1) > 0: In this case, we have, (a) = q
                              2
                              jn
                              (1) + (1 − q
                              2) jn
                              (0) ≤ q
                              1
                              jn
                              (1) + (1 − q
                              1) jn
                              (0) ≤ 0. The first inequality is from q
                              1 > q
                              2, jn
                              (0) ≤ 0 and jn
                              (1) > 0. The second inequality is from above.

Case (ii): When jn
                              (1) ≤ 0: In this case, (a) = q
                              2
                              jn
                              (1) + (1 − q
                              2) jn
                              (0) ≤ 0 because jn
                              (1) ≤ 0 and jn
                              (0) ≤ 0.

Cases (i) and (ii) prove that (a) ≤ 0. Since we have (a) ≥ 0 from above, we conclude that (a) = 0. Hence, an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = 0.

Case IV: When an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = (b) − (d): Since (b) is the outcome of the first maximization above, we must have jn
                              (0) ≥ jn
                              (1). Since (d) is the outcome of the second maximization above, we must have jn
                              (1) ≥ jn
                              (0). Hence, we have jn
                              (0) = jn
                              (1). Therefore, an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = q
                              1(jn
                              (0) − jn
                              (1)) = 0.

Case V: When an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = (b) − (e): We have an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = jn
                              (0) − jn
                              (0) = 0.

Case VI: When an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = (b) − ( f): Since (b) is the outcome of the first maximization above, we have jn
                              (0) ≥ 0. Since (f) is the outcome of the second maximization above, we have jn
                              (0) ≤ 0. Hence, we have jn
                              (0) = 0. Therefore, an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = 0.

In Cases VII, VIII and IX, we consider an
                              (q
                              2) = (c) = 0. In all three cases, we have an
                              (q
                              2) − an
                              (q
                              1) = −an
                              (q
                              1) ≤ 0 since an
                              (q
                              1) is nonnegative by Theorem 4, Part 2.

Hence, Tn
                              (in
                              ) is decreasing in qn
                              . This result together with Eq. (13) imply 
                                 
                                    i
                                    n
                                    *
                                 
                               is decreasing in qn
                              . This completes the proof of the theorem.
