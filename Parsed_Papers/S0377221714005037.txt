                  Consider a general coherent system with independent or dependent components, and assume that the components are randomly chosen from two different stocks, with the components of the first stock having better reliability than the others. Then here we provide sufficient conditions on the component’s lifetimes and on the random numbers of components chosen from the two stocks in order to improve the reliability of the whole system according to different stochastic orders. We also discuss several examples in which such conditions are satisfied and an application to the study of the optimal random allocation of components in series and parallel systems. As a novelty, our study includes the case of coherent systems with dependent components by using basic mathematical tools (and copula theory).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Coherent systems are basic concepts in reliability theory (see, e.g., Barlow & Proschan (1981) and Kuo & Zhu (2012) for a detailed introduction to coherent systems, related properties and applications). Series systems, parallel systems and k-out-of-n systems are particular cases of coherent systems. In the theory of coherent systems, it is important to study the performance of a system composed by different kinds of units, and to define the optimal allocation of these units in the system. Some results on this topic are given in da Costa Bueno (2005), da Costa Bueno and do Carmo (2007), Li and Ding (2010), Brito, Zequeira, and Valdés (2011), Misra, Dhariyal, and Gupta (2009), Navarro and Rychlik (2010), Zhang (2010), Eryilmaz (2012), Kuo and Zhu (2012), Zhao, Chan, Li, and Ng (2013), Zhao, Chan, and Ng (2012), Belzunce, Martínez-Puertas, and Ruiz (2013), Levitin, Xing, and Dai (2014), and Hazra and Nanda (2014). In this context, a translation of the Parrondo’s paradox was proposed in Di Crescenzo (2007). Parrondo’s paradox shows that, in game theory, sometimes a random strategy might be a better option than any deterministic strategy. Analogously, Di Crescenzo (2007) proves that in a series system with independent non-identically distributed components, the random choice of these components is a better option than to use components with different distributions in the system. Indeed, Di Crescenzo (2007) proved that, in some situations, a random choice is the best option when we have to choose between two kinds of units having different behaviors. This result was extended to other system structures and to the case of dependent components in Navarro and Spizzichino (2010). More recently, the analysis of series and parallel systems formed by components having independent lifetimes and randomly chosen from two different stocks has been performed in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011). In that paper, they assume that the components can be chosen from two stocks, where the items of a batch are better than those of the other one in the usual stochastic order. Under these assumptions, they obtain conditions on the random numbers of components chosen from the two stocks such that the reliability of system’s lifetime improves. Similar results were obtained recently in Hazra and Nanda (2014) for other stochastic orders and for series and parallel systems with independent components.

In this paper we extend the results given in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011) and Hazra and Nanda (2014) for series and parallel systems with independent components to general coherent systems with arbitrary structures and with possibly dependent components. We also show that these results can be used to study the optimal random allocation in a coherent system of components chosen from two different stocks.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recall useful notions and definitions, such as the definitions of the stochastic orders used to compare the performances of systems, and the notion of copula, which is used to formally describe the dependence between the component lifetimes. We also describe the model of coherent systems with a random number of components chosen from different stocks. Section 3 contains the main results, which are centered on conditions to improve these systems in the stochastic, hazard rate, reversed hazard rate and likelihood ratio orders. In Section 4 we study ordering properties for systems in which the units are chosen randomly by means of Bernoulli trials. Several examples are provided in Section 5 to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular, certain general results are obtained for series systems when the dependence between the components is modeled by an Archimedean copula. An application to the study of the optimal random allocation of components in series and parallel systems is given in Section 6. Finally, some concluding remarks are presented in Section 7.

Firstly, we briefly recall the definitions of the stochastic orders that will be used throughout the paper to compare random lifetimes or the random numbers of components chosen from the two stocks. For further details, basic properties and applications of these orders, we refer the reader to Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007), or to Barlow and Proschan (1981) where, in particular, a list of applications in reliability theory is described.

Hence, the hazard rate order and the reversed hazard rate order are often employed to compare residual lifetimes and inactivity times of systems, respectively, and the likelihood ratio order can be used to compare both residual lifetimes and inactivity times, while this is not the case for the weaker usual stochastic order. Moreover, the following relationships are well known:

As pointed out in Nelsen (2006), many standard distributions (such as the ones in Gumbel, Frank, Clayton and Ali–Mikhail–Haq families) are special cases of this class. We also refer the reader to Müller and Scarsini (2005) or McNeil and Nes̆lehová (2009), and references therein, for details, properties and recent applications of Archimedean copulas. All the Archimedean copulas are exchangeable, that is,

                           ϕ

In other words, the dependence is due to the system (by effect of the common environment, of the position of the components, etc.), and not by the number k of components which came from

                            is convex for any series system (with this dependence model). Thus, from (ii) in the preceding proposition, we obtain that Theorem 1 in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011) can be applied to series systems with dependent components having an arbitrary exchangeable survival copula S. Analogously, from (i), we obtain that

The proof is obtained from (2.5), Proposition 3.3 and Theorem 1.B.14 in Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007). In Example 5.1 we provide a simple sufficient condition for (3.7) in the special case of series systems and Archimedean copulas. In particular, for series systems with independent components we have

We proceed similarly as above, but working with the cumulative distribution functions instead of working with the reliability functions. The proof of the following statement is similar to that of Proposition 3.3 and thus it is omitted.

Thus we consider the two coherent systems with lifetimes

                      have the same copula, the two systems have the same domination function H. We also recall that the copula of the system does not depend on the inserted components, but it relies on the common environment.

In order to state a more general result for the usual stochastic order, we first need to recall the following two well-known majorization orders (see, e.g., Marshall, Olkin, & Arnold (2011, p. 12)). Let

The proof can be obtained from Theorem A.8 in Marshall et al. (2011, p. 87).


                     Durante and Sempi (2003) (see also Nelsen (2006, p. 134)), proved that every Archimedean copula is Schur-concave. So the preceding proposition can be applied to series systems with dependent components having Archimedean survival copulas since, in this case, 
                        
                           H
                           =
                           S
                        
                     .

As a consequence of the preceding proposition, we have the following result for coherent systems with components chosen randomly via Bernoulli trials. Again we remark that the systems have the same structure and the components have the same dependence structure (copula), independently on the outcomes of the Bernoulli trials.

In this section some theoretical examples are included to illustrate the application of the results given in the foregoing. These examples show that the different conditions stated in the preceding sections might hold, or not, depending on the system structure and on the dependence between the components. Therefore, in some cases, to increase the number of good components does not necessarily lead to an improvement of the system performance (under different comparison criteria).

The first example shows that in the case that the dependence among components is described by Archimedean survival copulas, then the condition (3.7), which can be restated in terms of the generator of the copula, is not always satisfied even considering simple series systems. Moreover this example also illustrated the fact that whenever the components have a negative dependence based on an Archimedean structure, then such dependence plays in favor of condition (3.7). The example also shows that the conditions in Propositions 3.4 and 3.8 might hold for a series system with dependent components.

                            corresponding to the generator of the copula is increasing and logconvex. It is interesting to observe that the increasing hazard rate property of the generator corresponds to a copula with negative dependence (see, for instance, Averous & Dortet-Bernadet (2004)). So that negative dependence plays in favor of this ordering result. For related results, see also Chapter 11 in Jaworski et al. (2010).

                           , and the lifetime of the first system will be smaller, in the usual stochastic order, than the lifetime of the second one. Thus, in this series system and with this common dependence (copula), the homogeneity between components improves the reliability of the system. Hence it is better to choose them randomly at each position in the system. It should be pointed out that the same statement also follows from Theorem 5.4 in Navarro and Spizzichino (2010). ♢

In practice, there are several situations in which we have to use different kinds of units to build coherent systems. In such situations, we have to develop optimal procedures for the allocation of the units in the system to get the best coherent system. For example, if we have two kinds of components (in a similar number) to build series systems with two independent components then, surprisingly, a random choice of these components leads to a series system which is always better than the series system obtained by choosing one component from each kind. This is known as the Parrondo’s paradox in the reliability theory, see Di Crescenzo (2007). Similar results were obtained in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011) for series and parallel systems with independent components and in Navarro and Spizzichino (2010) for arbitrary coherent systems with possibly dependent components.

The theoretical results obtained in this paper can be used to go further and analyze the optimal allocation of the components in a system when we only have two kinds of components and some are better than the other. Of course, the best systems are always those which include only the best components. However, we shall assume that this option is not possible, maybe simply because we do not know which are the best components, and that we want to use both kinds of components, with a fixed general proportion.

In these situations, as we have already mentioned before, random strategies may leed to the best systems. In this paper, two procedures for the selection of the components have been studied. In Section 3, we considered a random choice of the number k of good components in the systems through a discrete random variable K with support included in the set

                     . In Section 4, we considered coherent systems obtained by choosing the component at position i in the system by using a Bernoulli trial with probability

                     . In both procedures, we considered both the cases of systems with independent or with dependent components (with a given copula for the dependency model).

In this general framework, which is the best strategy? Could the performance be improved by using random strategies? Will the best strategy depend on the system structure and/or on the dependence model between the components? To answer these questions, let us consider first the simple case of a series system with two independent components and let us assume that we have a 50% of good units and a 50% of bad units (the reasoning is similar with other proportions). Then, by using the notation introduced in Section 4, we can consider the series systems with lifetimes

If the components are dependent, then we have seen that H is equal to the survival copula S. From Proposition 4.2,

                      is also the best option for series systems of components with dependence determined by a Schur-concave survival copula S, as it is, for example, in the case of Archimedean copulas. However, this is not always the case (see Navarro & Spizzichino, 2010, Example 6.2).

Analogously, if we consider a parallel system with two independent components, then the best options are

                     , whereas the worst option is 
                        
                           
                              
                                 q

                                 2
                              
                           
                           =
                           1
                           /
                           2
                        
                     . From Proposition 4.2, the same happens if the components in the parallel system are dependent with a Schur-concave distribution copula C. Therefore, in general, the optimal choice will depend on both the system structure and the dependency model.

Now let us try to improve the system performance by using the random procedure studied in Section 3. We start again with the simple case of a series system with two independent components. In this procedure the number of good components in the system is determined by a random discrete variable K over the set 
                        
                           {
                           0
                           ,
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           }
                        
                     . By using the notation introduced in Section 3, the associated system lifetime is represented by 
                        
                           
                              
                                 T
                              
                              
                                 K
                              
                           
                        
                     . Again we shall assume that there are 50% of good and bad units, that is, 
                        
                           E
                           (
                           K
                           )
                           =
                           1
                        
                      (the reasoning is similar with other values). Note that the system with a good component and a bad component can now be represented as

Note that such conclusion is not surprising because this is what we usually do in the real life. For example, if a remote control has two batteries in series and we have two good batteries and two bad (or different) batteries, we usually put together the good batteries and the bad batteries (we do not mix them).

The conclusion is just the opposite when we consider a parallel system with two independent components (or with two dependent components having an exchangeable copula). In this case the best option is

                     , that is, to put a good component jointly with a bad component (put together different components). Thus, for example, if a plane has two engines and it can fly with just one of them, then, if we have two planes, two good engines and two engines not so good as the previous ones, the best option is, of course, put a good and a ‘not so good’ engine in each plane. The same conclusion holds if we just do not know which are the good engines or if the engines lifetimes are dependent with a symmetric dependence model (an exchangeable copula), which is a reasonable assumption in practice. The results included in this paper can be used to analyze other system structures and other dependency models. Moreover, there are also practical situations in which the random numbers

                      are comparable in the likelihood ratio order (thus also in the hazard and the reverse hazard orders), as those illustrated in Section 4 in Hazra and Nanda (2014). In these cases all the statements in previous sections dealing with comparisons of systems in the lr, hr and rhr orders can be applied.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Surprisingly some coherent systems are not ordered (in different stochastic senses) when a unit is replaced by a better unit. Also, some systems might be improved if the components are chosen randomly. In this paper we have developed some procedures to compare coherent systems with two kinds of units having a fixed number or a random number of the best units. We also consider the case of systems in which the units are chosen randomly at each position by using independent Bernoulli trials. We consider various assumptions which include different system structures and different dependency between the components (including the independent case) but always assuming that the system structure and dependency model are the same (i.e. only the components are changed). Our results are distribution-free since they hold for any kind of components having stochastically ordered lifetimes (in different senses). The given examples show that the our findings can be applied to several situations. Specific results are obtained for series systems with dependent components having a common Archimedean copula. A practical application on the optimal allocation of components in a system structure is also given to illustrate the theoretical results.
