                  Engineering and operations management decisions have become increasingly complex as a result of recent advances in information technology. The increased ability to access and communicate information has resulted in expanded system domains consisting of multiple agents, each exhibiting autonomous decision-making capabilities, with potentially complex logistics. Challenges regarding the management of these systems include heterogenous utility drivers and risk preferences among the agents, and various sources of system uncertainty. This paper presents a distributed options-based model that manages the impact of multiple forms of uncertainty from a multi-agent perspective, while adapting as both the stream of information and the capabilities of the agents are better known. Because the actions of decision makers may have an impact on the evolution of underlying sources of uncertainty, this endogenous relationship is modeled and a solution approach developed that converges to an equilibrium system state and improves the performance of agents and the system. The final result is a distributed options-based decision-making policy that both responds to and controls the evolution of uncertainty in large-scale engineering and operations management domains.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Technology and operations management decisions have become increasingly complex in recent years. The increased ability to access and communicate information has resulted in expanded system domains consisting of multiple agents (decision-makers), with each exhibiting autonomous decision-making capabilities. Although these systems may possess the ability to perform and achieve benefits that are beyond those capable of smaller networks (Weiss, 1999), the following challenges are presented. First, the agents may possess individual utility drivers, thus creating an environment that must balance the goals of multiple agents and the overall system. Because an agent may exhibit a finite performance capacity, choices must be made regarding how to most effectively utilize each agent. These decisions are further complicated due to both continuous forms of uncertainty that provide a constant source of variability, as well as discrete, and sometimes rare, events that may provide dramatic disruptions to the system processes. Furthermore, the actions of agents may have an endogenous impact on system characteristics, performance capacity, and underlying sources of uncertainty. Because these systems possess dynamic properties, continuous information updating creates a decision timing issue for the agents where the benefits and costs of waiting for additional information must be considered. This paper develops a distributed decision-making approach that incorporates decision flexibility to manage the impact of multiple uncertainties from a multi-agent perspective, and improve both agent and system performances.

Consider the increase in technological innovation and the resulting impact on operations management. As information and communication technologies have increased, the competitive landscape has also increased resulting in a global network of suppliers, producers, and distributors. Many of these supply chain entities are contract manufacturers and compete among other firms for their place in the chain. Because it is imperative to operate in a lean manner, costs must be kept to a minimum and resources allocated to yield a maximum utility. This utility can be viewed in two ways. From a systems point of view, production of the final good or service needs to be performed and delivered to the end customer in the most cost effective manner. However, each entity in the supply chain may be considered an agent (e.g., an individual supplier, producer, distributor) that makes its decisions based on satisfying its own economic utility drivers.

The resulting decisions that each individual agent makes may be further complicated by various sources of uncertainty. For example, production facilities typically exhibit a finite resource capacity and challenging decisions must be made when devising operating schedules and determining which customer orders to satisfy. These decisions are complicated by both the uncertain nature of the resource performance and customer order rates. A producer may engage in a contract with an initial customer that utilizes its full capacity, but is then unable to satisfy an additional customer order that may yield even greater profits, thus jeopardizing its competitive position in the supply chain. From the customer’s perspective, resource selection and contracting decisions may be based on such factors as a desired delivery date or price. These contracted conditions, however, may ultimately be subject to the performance uncertainty of the production resource. If the resource can produce with lower levels of process variability, then it may be able to quote better delivery dates and lower prices. Therefore, both the customer and producer benefit by more stability in the resource operations.

When devising a decision-making policy for this type of system, it is important to not only consider exogenous factors, but also recognize any endogenous parameter relationships. In this example, a possible endogenous relationship may exist between production stability and the types of customer orders that the resource processes. By recognizing this relationship, the resource may be used to process customer orders that encourage performance stability. These particular orders may be ones that are easier to process or provide smoother scheduling with fewer disruptions and reduced setup costs. The resulting improvements to operational stability may therefore yield reductions in future production uncertainty.

In order to effectively manage these types of systems, a decision-making approach must be employed that retains flexibility as the stream of new information arrives, while hedging the impact of uncertainty for multiple agents and incorporating the endogenous relationship between agent decisions, system responses, and future performance capacity. Without flexibility, each agent must act immediately based on the information currently available. Because there is now an increasing amount of real-time system information available, it may be very beneficial to postpone the timing of any decision and re-evaluate based on updated system states. The approach developed in this paper is based on the concept of dynamic flexibility using options-based decision policies. It should be noted that this model does not utilize the Black Scholes options pricing model (Black & Scholes, 1973) or any other closed form solution method that is commonly used in the literature. In an effort to provide insights into systems that do not meet the strict assumptions of these closed form solution approaches, a depiction of a multi-agent resource allocation system was designed and a numerical solution presented in this paper. This model is tested to evaluate the impact of managing uncertainty from a distributed decision-making perspective with respect to improvements in both agent utilities and system properties while adhering to limited and finite capacity resource constraints.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of literature encompassing the three primary areas used as the basis of this paper: real options, options exercise games, and risk management in engineering and operational systems. In Section 3, a specific multi-agent system is defined and a distributed options-based model is developed that includes both agents’ perspectives while accounting for the endogenous relationship between agent decisions, system performance, and the impact on the underlying source of system uncertainty. This distributed options-based policy is tested numerically in Section 4 and concluding remarks are presented in Section 5. A table giving descriptions of the variables used in the mathematical formulations is presented in Appendix A (online only). Specific model details pertaining to the multi-agent case study consisting of a task and resource agent are included in Appendix B and C (online only), respectively.

The model developed in this paper encompasses three primary research areas: (1) the extension of options-based decision theory into an engineering and operations management domain; (2) the impact of competitive agents on the ultimate decision-making process in an options framework; and (3) current approaches toward managing the impact of uncertainty in large-scale engineering and operational systems. The first area demonstrates the flexibility of utilizing options pricing concepts in non-financial domains; the second area introduces a relatively new area of research referred to as “options exercise games”; and the final area provides a domain for which the findings of this paper may be applied. This section provides a review of some of the more relevant research in these areas to the scope of this paper.

Since the seminal work of Black and Scholes (1973) and of Merton (1973), options pricing concepts have been used extensively to value financial assets, with the theory then extended to real assets (Myers, 1977) and commonly referred to as “real options”. Some of the common types of real options used in operations and project management decisions include the following: the option to defer investment decisions; a time-to-build option for staged investments; the option to alter the scale of operations through expansion, contraction, shut-downs, or restarts; the option to abandon operations or a project; the option to switch outputs, inputs, or operating modes; growth options; and complex multiple interacting options (Trigeorgis, 1996). Because managerial and operational decisions may be considered at least partially irreversible, there is a value to waiting for more information about the system prior to making a decision. Detailed accounts of both the theory and applications of real options are provided in Dixit and Pindyck (1994) and Trigeorgis (1996). Similar to these applications, the focus area of this paper is with decisions pertaining to real assets (e.g., production capacity). However, this paper further extends these existing options-based concepts into a domain consisting of multiple decision makers.

In the supply chain situation described in Section 1, each agent may interact in a competitive manner to maximize its own utility. Consequently, the concept of options exercise games has recently evolved and provides an intersection of traditional real options analysis with game theory. In many situations, the ultimate utility gained from an investment in a real asset is affected by the investment strategies and actions of other agents in the system. This characteristic of real options differs from financial options in many application domains. For example, real assets with respect to real estate development often have a finite elasticity of demand; developers may have finite capacities; there is a limited supply of options available; and there is typically less than perfect competition among developers (Williams, 1993). Financial assets, however, do not exhibit these restrictions and the exercise of a financial option by any agent does not change the characteristics of the security or the option (Grenadier, 2002). In order to account for the impact of other agents’ exercise strategies on the underlying value of a real option and the subsequent optimal exercise policy for a given agent, game theoretic principles must be included in the analysis. The model presented in this paper incorporates game theoretic options to account for the changes in system characteristics and agent payoffs that occur due to the presence of other agents. Because resource capacities are finite, a task agent’s allocation option exercise policy must account for the expected actions of other task agents competing for the resource’s services. This scenario provides an extended domain for the application of options exercise games concepts when allocating resources in large-scale engineering and operational systems.

Traditional work in large-scale engineering and operational systems, such as production systems and supply chain networks, has focused primarily on improving the overall cost-efficiency of the system. Whereas these models provide an efficient and low cost approach to managing the system, there is little flexibility to respond in case any portion of the system does not perform as originally planned. Due to the cascading nature of these systems, the impact of even one portion of a network that does not operate as planned may propagate throughout the entire system, and thus have a dramatic effect on the overall performance of the system. Therefore, a disruption to an inflexible system may result in significant and widespread financial and performance costs.

The ability for a network to create flexibility and respond to uncertainties may allow businesses to realize efficient current performance and potentially be able to quickly reconfigure and benefit from new unforeseen market opportunities. As evident from the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, the United States northeast power outage of August 2003, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of April 2010, the Tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami of March 2011, and Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, this flexibility will also help to build more secure and resilient supply chain networks from a national security and emergency response standpoint (Rice & Caniato, 2003a; Rice & Caniato, 2003b). Snyder and Daskin (2005) manage system risk through strategic facility location planning. This type of proactive approach is used to incorporate risk management in the planning stage as opposed to being unprepared and reacting to failures during system operations. A review of some more common day-to-day sources of operational risks are presented in Chopra and Sodhi (2004) and include major disruptions, production delays, information system risks, forecasting risks, intellectual property risks, procurement risks, inventory risks, and capacity risks. This attention that has been drawn to managing the impact of uncertainty in large-scale systems may be applied to both continuous operational uncertainties and the discrete disruptions that may be rare, but result in major impact.

Competition and game theory have been incorporated into the traditional supply chain models for systems with multiple suppliers. Elmaghraby (2000) provides a literature review regarding the competition for supply contracts and sourcing policies. Minner (2003) provides a good review of multiple supplier inventory models to mitigate the effects of shortages situations, as well as related inventory problems that arise in the areas of reverse logistics and multi-echelon systems. Babich, Burnetas, and Ritchken (2007) and Babich (2006) utilized both game theory and real options to analyze contracting for a single retailer and multiple suppliers when subject to supplier default risk during their production lead times. Ball and Deshmukh (2013) developed a cooperative real options approach utilizing an incentive (or disincentive) pricing scheme to hedge systemic risks when coordinating multi-agent decisions in supply chain and resource allocations systems.

This paper builds upon these concepts to provide two key contributions to this area: (1) flexibility in distributed decision-making from multi-agent perspectives and (2) endogeneity between agent actions and an underlying source of uncertainty. Therefore, this paper extends the current research to develop a general distributed decision-making model that manages the impact of uncertainty from multiple agent perspectives in such a way that both agents benefit (e.g., both the retailer and supplier in a supply chain network), while accounting for endogenous parameter modeling that yields overall system improvements. This general model can be used to incorporate distributed decision policies and risk management in a wide range of resource-constrained domains, including engineering and system design processes, new technology development, enterprise systems, healthcare systems, homeland security, emergency preparedness and response, global operations, and supply chain management.

For the purpose of this paper, the following model is constructed to manage the impact of uncertainty from the perspectives of two agents: a task and resource agent. The dynamics of this general system are explained throughout Section 3 and illustrated in Fig. 1
                        . Appendix A (online only) has a summary table of descriptions of the notations used in the paper. In this system, the resource performs operations on a task to produce an output (e.g., product for resale, consulting service). Tasks arrive at the system with the agent’s goal of allocating them to a resource for processing and an ultimate utility. The resource may initiate processing a task at set discrete time slots. At any given time slot, the resource presents its current production capacity in the form of a conditionally guaranteed process rate, which would consequently assure the task agent of a guaranteed delivery time and cost for the finished product. Because production systems commonly exhibit continuous random fluctuations in process times for various task types and sizes, it is assumed that this associated resource process rate evolves stochastically according to a known distribution (e.g., the square-root mean reversion process). The decision for the task agent to request processing based on the terms of this current guaranteed process rate and give up the option to wait for a more beneficial rate (and associated completion time and cost) in the future is framed as an irreversible investment decision by the task agent and evaluated using options-based solution techniques.

Additional tasks randomly arrive to the system, thus creating a dynamic environment that may limit the choices available to the task agent. Task types are heterogeneous and provide varying levels of utility benefit to the resource production system. Because the resource is of finite capacity and can only process one task at a time, it will consequently maintain a preference level for each task type based on the task’s respective utility contribution to the system. The current task agent recognizes this inherent competition for the resource’s capacity, and therefore factors the risk associated with postponing the allocation decision and subsequently experiencing preemption from a preferred task that may arrive to the system prior to making this decision. If preemption occurs, the task may not be eligible to begin processing until the next available time slot. Therefore, flexibility in decision timing from the perspective of the task agent may be beneficial with respect to ensuring a more economic and timely delivery of the final product; waiting too long may reduce the availability of the resource due to the potential arrival of competing, and preferred, tasks.

Once the task agent makes its decision to accept the conditions of a given process rate and request processing from the resource, the resource must then decide whether to allow this current task to exercise its allocation option or deny processing in case a more beneficial task arrives in the future. The resource agent recognizes an endogenous relationship between its actual realized system performance costs (e.g., due to idleness and overtime factors) and the ultimate stability of the production operations, and the respective decision policy is constructed accordingly. Because of this relationship, the resource agent aligns its utility driver to one that prefers to process tasks that will have a positive effect on its future stability and performance capabilities. This type of situation may occur when the starting and stopping of production is minimized, and setups are therefore held to a minimum. Therefore, more stable production operations may yield a reduction in the overall uncertainty of the system. In this particular system, reduced performance uncertainty will lower the risk posed by the stochastic resource process rate and experienced by both the task and resource agents. So, from the resource agent’s viewpoint, flexibility in its decision timing will allow it to better control both the immediate utility gained from processing various task types as well as future production stability.

A major contribution of this paper is that this particular system and model utilizes a dual options-based policy where both the task and resource agents value a similar option, but from two distinct viewpoints. The task agent considers the option to request processing at the current guaranteed rate (and corresponding time and cost conditions) or postpone this decision until a future time period. The resource agent, however, considers the option of either accepting a task’s request for processing, or instead postponing this processing decision to evaluate future opportunities that may be more beneficial to its specific utility function. Thus, each agent essentially possesses an option of either enacting a processing decision or waiting for more information regarding the system, however from a different perspective.

Furthermore, the underlying sources of uncertainty are viewed differently by the task and resource agents. The task agent considers the sources of uncertainty to be exogenous and, therefore, makes its decisions in an effort to respond to the potential impacts posed by these uncertainties (i.e., the stochastic process rate and the discrete arrivals of potentially preempting tasks). However, the resource agent considers the future task arrivals to be exogenous, but realizes that there is an endogenous relationship between its decisions and the future evolution of the system’s uncertainty and, therefore, makes its decisions in a way that controls this evolution by carefully selecting tasks that encourage system stability. Therefore, the dual policy extracts value from the system by making decisions in a manner that yields a more beneficial evolution of system uncertainty. The reader may refer again to the dynamic process illustrated in Fig. 1 to assist with this understanding. This model now both responds to the impact of multiple forms of uncertainty in the system and from the perspectives of multiple agents, and also manages the future propagation of an underlying source of process uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate both the model development and benefits using a general theoretical multi-agent system; however, the theory may be applied to other domains exhibiting this type of agent and system behavior.

The model system environment has been designed to allow for task type heterogeneity and support the decision-making process for both the task and resource agents with multiple forms of uncertainty and dynamic states. Multiple state parameters are required to characterize the system environment at any given time and support the complex decision-making processes.

                         is the known instantaneous process rate of the resource at time t. Processing that occurs at the resource during the time interval

                         is then modeled using this known process rate (i.e., 
                           
                              R

                        ) and the changes in this process rate that are expected to occur over this interval (i.e., dR). It is thus assumed that the process rate of a resource evolves stochastically over a time interval of length dt according to the following square-root, mean-reversion process:

Because the ultimate payoff utility is a function of the guaranteed process rate, there is an incentive for the task agent to wait for a more beneficial process rate that would lead to lower processing costs and more timely delivery (i.e., thus yielding a higher value of

                        The terminal boundary condition is presented in Eq. (7) and indicates that the task agent may be subject to a penalty cost ζ if it allows the option to expire at the maturity date T (i.e., the task never gets submitted for processing). The boundary conditions of Eqs. (8) and (9) represent the “value-matching” and “smooth-pasting” conditions as described in Dixit and Pindyck (1994). For this paper, the task agent’s allocation option value and decision policy was solved using a numerical approximation method presented in Hull and White (1990).

Whereas the termination value is given by Eq. (4), determining the continuation value is more complicated and must account for each possible system scenario. If a current task i decides to postpone its allocation decision from time t until

Because the resource only accepts new tasks for processing at discretized time periods, it is important to evaluate any potential resource blocking scenarios when determining this continuation value. Given the assumption that tasks arrive randomly according to a Poisson distribution of rate λ and, once arrived, the task type is drawn from the distribution

For this case, it may be possible to be blocked either until the task’s expiration date, or for a lesser time period that still allows for the current task i to be processed prior to its expiration date. The discounted value of continuing until expiration (i.e., expected blocking at least until the task’s expiration date) is evaluated from

It is also possible that blocking will occur for a time period that ends prior to the expiration date and the task agent may retain the opportunity to allocate the task at some time period in the future. In this case, it is necessary to evaluate the continuation value for each possible number of blocking periods.

The resource agent constructs its decision policy in such a manner that extracts value from the endogenous nature of its source of performance uncertainty and improves its ability to maintain a stable operational system. For any given time t that the resource is unoccupied and an eligible task (i.e., the highest valued task currently in the queue) agent i requests to exercise its allocation option, the resource agent must evaluate its option to either (1) accept the current task for processing, or (2) postpone processing and wait until a future time

Note that, although there may be an endogenous relationship between many types of performance metrics, the act of planning for increased utilization is most appropriate for the system explored in this paper. For this reason, only the resource utilization

                         (and associated idleness costs) are included in the resource agent’s policy. The same theoretical approach, however, may be used to include planning for other performance cost metrics, such as overtime costs.

This resource decision is based on the relationship between the task type X and the resource’s utility preference (i.e.,

                        , but not at both times. This assumption provides a conservative measure of task processing that may be representative of various resource limitations, such as the supply of raw materials, manpower, or excess start-up costs.

                        So, the resource agent will accept the task agent’s request to exercise its allocation option provided that the expected impact on its utilization is non-negative. The reader is referred to Ball (2007) and Appendix C (online only) for specific details pertaining to the resource agent’s policy for the example system tested in this paper.

Although both the task and resource agents make their decisions to hedge the impact of system uncertainty, this model also accounts for the actual costs that occur once these decisions have been made and the system evolves. Thus, although a task agent exercises its allocation option and is assured a guaranteed process rate

                         and associated delivery time, the actual time that the task will be completed is still unknown due to processing uncertainty. Consequently, various system costs will also be unknown (i.e., the resource idleness costs or overtime costs incurred to assure that the quoted delivery date is satisfied). As the system process capacity evolves according to the distribution of

It should now be recognized that there may be an indirect relationship between these system performance costs and the future stability of the production system. A stable system in this case may be one that consists of lowered and/or more constant levels of production rate uncertainty. It may be noted that each of these costs does not merely represent an exogenous effect of the process uncertainty, but also possesses a direct impact on the evolution of this uncertainty.

Therefore, it may be deduced that some systems will yield more stable production systems if these performance costs are reduced (i.e.,

                                    d
                                    Θ
                                 
                              
                              >
                              0
                           
                        ). The recognition of this relationship provides the resource with a means of basing its processing decisions on their expected impact to future production stability, and allowing for a policy that both responds to, and controls, the underlying source of system risk. Given the relationship between task size and task type (i.e., 
                           
                              x

                        ), and the nature of the system, it may be observed that higher valued tasks will reduce the system performance costs (i.e.,

Therefore, it may be assumed for this system that σ is monotonically related to both Θ and X (i.e., σ is monotonically increasing with respect to Θ and decreasing with respect to X). This relationship supports the notion that the resource agent will prefer higher valued tasks; thus,

                         is a specified multiplicative factor. Thus, the system’s current and future levels of operational stability are based on previous periods’ performance metrics. This linkage provides for the recognition that the agent decisions may be made to both respond to, and control the future propagation of, system uncertainty and corresponding risk.

As the model is applied to multiple time periods, the level of risk in the system should approach an equilibrium value. Now, if both agents act consistently with their respective optimal decision policies, this equilibrium state may be representative of a Nash equilibrium.

This section presented both task and resource agent policies to manage their respective risks, and an overall process to reach system equilibrium. The solution algorithm developed in this section is summarized in Algorithm 1 to highlight the overall flow of logic and the ordering of different decision processes.

This section presents a case study of the major project selection process in construction industry. The firm in this case study has resources to process a single major project, or a task, at any given time. Projects, with different payoffs to the firm, arrive randomly into the system, and the firm receives revenue only after a project is completed. The processing rate of the firm varies over time given the personnel and equipment availability. The firm incurs losses if the resources are idle, and the projects incur waiting costs if they are not processed within a certain time horizon. In this discussion we consider a simplified case where the firm has a choice between at most two projects at any given time for expositional clarity.

Each system entity and the logic behind any task dynamics for this example system are now explained further. The Resource is the system’s resource group that processes the tasks. Queue 1 is the queue slot that, at any given time, will contain the highest valued task not currently being processed by the resource. Consequently, Queue 2 is the queue slot that contains the lower valued task (if more than one task is currently in the queueing system). Therefore, if only one task is in the queueing system (i.e.,

Based on the task/resource agent dual options-based decision policies and the resulting system performance costs incurred over any given time period, the model was tested using the theoretical concepts presented in this paper to incorporate the endogenous impact that these decisions have on the underlying source of system uncertainty. Thus, the agents are able to both respond to and control systemic risk using their respective dual options-based policy. The model was tested using simulation experiments until the dual policies produced convergence in the system’s level of uncertainty and its associated impact on the performance cost metrics.

Simulations were conducted over a time horizon

The model exhibiting distributed, options-based decision policies with endogeneity presented in this paper was analyzed by considering the resulting impacts to the task agent, the resource agent, and the overall system. The task agent’s options-based policy, and the percentage expected gain in utility of using this policy (

                         is higher for increased levels of σ, thus indicating that the task agent is more likely to postpone its allocation decision in systems exhibiting higher levels of production and processing uncertainty. Because the level of risk that the task agent is subjected to increases with respect to σ, the value of using the flexible options-based task allocation policy increases at higher levels of system processing uncertainty as shown in Fig. 3
                        . Furthermore, because there is a finite resource capacity and higher levels of new task arrival rates increase the threat of preemption, both the critical process rate

                        , respectively. It should also be noted that the value to the task agent of retaining the allocation option decreases as the time to maturity approaches. This effect results in a decreasing critical process rate

                         as the time in the system increases (see Figs. 2 and 4).

Given that the task agent’s initial decision is to request the exercise of its option and begin processing at the current guaranteed rate 
                           
                              R

                        , the resource agent focuses its decision policy to respond to this request in such a manner that extracts value from the endogenous nature of its source of performance uncertainty and improves its ability to maintain stable system operations while processing the highest valued tasks. The relative expected gain to the resource agent when using its policy (

                         are illustrated for a sample system state using the three-dimensional surface plot included as Fig. 6
                        . These results indicate that the resource agent benefit increases as the current task type decreases. Therefore, the resource’s ability to postpone processing of both smaller and lower prioritized task requests improves the overall expected utility for 
                           
                              X

Now that both the task and resource agents have developed and benefit from their respective options-based decision policies, the model was tested to determine the impact of these dual policies on the equilibrium state of the system. The model was simulated for various initial levels of σ using this dual policy until convergence was achieved according to Eqs. (26) and (27) and the results are shown in Figs. 7 and 8

                        ), the overall stability of the system improves at equilibrium, with the greatest changes occurring at higher levels of σ (i.e., approximate reductions in σ of 19% for the baseline case (
                           
                              σ
                              =
                              15
                           
                        ) and 24% when

                        ). These equilibrium reductions in production uncertainty (and, therefore, increases in operational stability) are also manifested in the changes in system performance costs. Based on the results presented in Fig. 8, it should be noted that, although the system idleness costs increase due to the ability of the agents to postpone allocation and processing decisions, the ability to manage the impact of system uncertainties results in increasing reductions of the system overtime costs with respect to the initial level of processing uncertainty (i.e., approximately 42% for the baseline case (
                           
                              σ

                              15
                           
                        ) and 47% when 
                           
                              σ
                              =
                              17.5
                           
                        ). The combination of changes in both the idleness and overtime costs results in an overall reduction of the total system performance costs of approximately 19% for the baseline case (i.e., 
                           
                              σ
                              =
                              15
                           
                        ) and up to 24% when 
                           
                              σ
                              =

                        . These system improvements increase with respect to the level of production uncertainty, thus following from the previous experimental results presented in this paper that demonstrate increasing agent gains when using options-based decision policies in systems exhibiting higher levels of uncertainty.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The primary objective of this paper was to develop a distributed decision-making approach that manages risk from a multi-agent perspective in large-scale engineering and operational systems, and improves both agent and system performance utilities under resource capacity constraints. The general approach used to develop the theoretical models for this paper was based on the intersection of engineering and operational systems management, the concept of dynamic flexibility using options-based decision policies, and game theory. The effect of managing the impact of multiple sources of uncertainty from a distributed decision-making perspective was evaluated with respect to improvements in both agent utilities and system properties while adhering to any limited and finite capacity resource constraints. By properly identifying an agent’s decision options and the relation to any underlying exogenous or endogenous system uncertainties, a wide range of resource-constrained domains may be modeled and solved using the distributed, options-based framework developed in this paper. Possible application domains include the management of engineering and system design processes, new technology development, enterprise systems, homeland security, healthcare systems, emergency preparedness and response systems, global operations, and supply chain networks.

The theoretical model developed in Section 3 was tested using a case study in Section 4. A primary contribution of this paper is to present a distributed decision-making model that manages the impact of uncertainty from a multi-agent perspective. In an effort to avoid limiting the model to the rare situations where conditions suitable to utilizing Black–Scholes options pricing techniques may be appropriate, this new model has been developed to be flexible so that it may be modified and applied to a much wider scope of real system domains. Because each of these domains may require unique modifications to the model, the general model developed in this paper was tested numerically in Section 4 and the ultimate findings should be translatable to a much wider range of technology and operations management systems.
