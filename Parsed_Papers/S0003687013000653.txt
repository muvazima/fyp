Human factors/ergonomics (HFE)

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  Discussions of the possible future of Human factors/ergonomics (HFE) usually take the past for granted in the sense that the future of HFE is assumed to be more of the same. This paper argues that the nature of work in the early 2010s is so different from the nature of work when HFE was formulated 60–70 years ago that a critical reassessment of the basis for HFE is needed. If HFE should be a systems discipline, it should be a soft systems rather than a hard systems discipline. It is not enough for HFE to seek to improve performance and well-being through systems design, since any change to the work environment in principle alters the very basis for the change. Instead HFE should try to anticipate how the nature of work will change so that it can both foresee what work will be and propose what work should be.
               
            

In 2010 the International Ergonomics Association (IEA) put together a small working group to address the questions of how human factors/ergonomics (HFE) should best maintain and strengthen its discipline and profession. The main issues of the discussion were: (1) how to characterise the core of HFE – how to describe that which presumably distinguishes it as a field of science; (2) how best to attract people – students, researchers, and practitioners – into the field at all levels; and (3) how to ensure that HFE meets the needs of a widened client base and market. This resulted in a ‘white paper’ (Dul et al., 2012), which is the frame of reference for the following comments.

As far as the first issue goes, it behoves every science every now and then to look at itself in a critical manner, to assess the achievements of the past, and to consider where it should be going in the future. (In the case of sciences whose raison d’être is their practical use rather than the neatness of their theories – and HFE is an example of that – then the achievements and the future direction are of particular importance.) For the classical sciences this kind of introspection does not happen very often. Good examples from recent history are perhaps Hilbert's programme in (meta)mathematics from 1920 and the current debate in cosmology about the existence of dark matter. In the natural sciences, the need for introspection usually arises because some fundamental problem proves near intractable, sometimes leading to a paradigm shift (Kuhn, 1962). In the social sciences, among which HFE will be considered, the need is more likely to arise because the field of study is challenged, i.e., because of problems with the practice rather than the theory. The social sciences by and large study various phenomena of human society and behaviour, among them human work. But the characteristics of society, and in particular the nature of human work, have changed dramatically since the beginning of the 20th century. This can easily be seen from the differences in world views that are expressed by Scientific Management (Taylor, 1911), by human factors engineering (Fitts, 1951), by ergonomics (including cognitive ergonomics) (Meister, 1999), by cognitive systems engineering (Hollnagel and Woods, 1983), by human-computer (or computer-human) interaction (Card et al., 1983), etc. The rapid development of various technologies, and the even more rapid adaptation of such developments as potential work enablers by industry stakeholders, have brought about a seemingly never ending flow of changes to work – both in terms of the products and services that are produced and in terms of how they are produced. The nature of work is changing before our very eyes and the half-life of skills and competencies is for ever decreasing. The challenges to HFE as a science do not come from fundamental theoretical issues, unlike mathematics and the natural sciences. The challenges to HFE come from a rapidly moving target – the practical needs – that rarely stay in sight long enough to be properly identified.

In order to understand the future of HFE, we must understand the past. The background for HFE was the need to find solutions to some practical problems. The problems were characteristic of the nature of work at the time – the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. Since the nature of work in the 2010, one hundred years later, is significantly different, it is only reasonable to consider whether the traditional formulations of the problems – and a forteriori also the solutions – still are valid today.

Ergonomics as we know it now became a recognised scientific discipline in the late 1940s under the name of human factors engineering. There were of course intellectual precursors, such as Jastrzębowski's proposal for a ‘science of work’ (1857) and the various proposals for praxiology (as the science of efficient action), but in more practical terms – which means doing something rather than just arguing about it – Scientific Management theory (Taylor, 1911) from the early 20th century is as good a place to begin as any. The purpose of Scientific Management was very practical, namely to analyse and synthesise work flows in order to improve labour productivity. To do so, Scientific Management introduced a number of principles and techniques that are still being widely used, although their origin may have been forgotten.
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Today ‘Taylorism’ is unfortunately often used in a negative sense meaning an oversimplified and ‘mechanical’ approach to work management.
                      Examples are bottom-up task analysis, time and motion studies, and task decomposition. Scientific Management therefore rightly deserves to be seen as a kind of proto-ergonomics.

The initial emphasis on efficiency and productivity was later in the century supplemented, if not quite replaced, by a need to ensure that humans and technology could work well together. This need was not due to changes in humans, but to changes in technology and thereby changes to the nature of work. The changes were based on the technological and intellectual developments around the 1940s, where the best known example is the digital computer – or in today's terms, information technology devices.

At the time when Scientific Management theory was formulated, machines were basically mechanical and used for well-defined functions in the manufacturing of goods, production of power, propulsion of large and small vehicles, etc. Machines were on the whole used for discrete individual tasks rather than for integrated processes; they were large and therefore visible in the sense that one could see (and hear or smell) what they were doing; they worked with limited speed due to their clunkiness and the inertia of the mechanical components; and they were relatively simple or uncomplicated in their functioning because the ability of self-regulation was restricted to what could be accomplished mechanically. All that changed with the advent of the digital computer and associated inventions such as the transistor and the integrated circuit. Machines could now be integrated or coupled together – leading to Perrow's (1984) nightmare of tightly coupled systems; they gradually became unobservable because the components kept shrinking in size (think of early computers such as the ENIAC compared to today's computer on a chip) and in some cases ended by being completely invisible; they became several orders of magnitude faster as well as more precise; and they finally also became able to do more complicated things because sensors and programmed logic enabled them to control themselves. Taken together this radically changed the nature of work and created a need, for which human factors engineering was proposed as the solution.

Although HFE defines itself as being about the design of work, it can also be understood as being about ‘the human use of human beings’ – not as an ethical issue (although that definitely is important also), but as how we ‘use’ ourselves as part of the fabric of society. One consequence of this is that HFE strictly speaking changes from being the science of work, or even the science of workplace design, to become the science of managing work – of communication and control in work situations, which might well be called work cybernetics. Indeed, it was Norbert Wiener, the creator of cybernetics, who first wrote about the human use of human beings (Wiener, 1954). His purpose was to analyse the potential of machines to amplify human capabilities, and thereby release them from the monotony of manual labour. This was done as part of a still ongoing debate about the benefits of automation to society, which ranged from the optimistic (Simon, 1965) to the pessimistic (Heilbroner, 1974). While the cybernetic objective of amplifying human capabilities is quite similar to what HFE aims to do, the similarity of the objectives obscures a fundamental difference in the approaches.

This can be seen by contrasting two definitions that ostensibly refer to the same phenomenon. The goal of HFE is described as trying
                           “to ensure that any designed artefact, ranging from a consumer product to an organisational environment, is shaped around the capacities and aspirations of humans, such that performance and well-being are optimised” (Dul et al., 2012, p. 2).
                        
                     

It is clear from this description that the goal is to find practical ways to fix local problems, so to speak. Cybernetics
                           2
                        
                        
                           2
                           Some will perhaps argue that cybernetics is a technical science, that it is about the control of machines, and that it therefore has limited relevance for a discussion of HFE. But cybernetics is, ironically, one of the sciences (together with information theory and game theory), which has led to radical changes the world we live in and thereby created the need for something like ergonomics.
                         offers a somewhat different view, which more than 50 years ago was expressed as follows:
                           “(W)e have modified our environment so radically that we must now modify ourselves in order to exist in this new environment” (Wiener, 1954, p. 46).
                        
                     

The contrast could hardly be greater: where the ambition of HFE is to design artefacts and work situations, the ambition of cybernetics is that we modify ourselves in the sense of understanding how the environments that we create affects what we can do, and vice versa. ‘Modifying ourselves’ is thus more than designing interfaces, interactions, and work environments (although that is also important). In order to ‘modify’ ourselves we need to understand not only the radical ways in which we have changed our work and living environments – often as an unanticipated side effect of trying to do something else – but also how they are likely to change in the future. While it is necessary to solve the problems that confront us now, it is in the larger perspective merely symptom-based fire fighting. We must clearly be able to do more than that. Therein lies the real challenge of ergonomics as a systems discipline. The challenge is not to design artefacts to match the capacities and aspirations of humans, but to understand how the world that is created by myopic artefact design affects, and sometimes invalidates, the very premises for the design itself.

In order to survive as a scientific discipline, HFE must therefore go beyond ‘tinkering’ with artefact design and human-technology interaction, and focus on how we can ‘modify ourselves so that we can continue to exist in the environment that we have modified’. In other words, since we need to find ways to manage or control humans at work, we must start by acknowledging that work itself changes because of our interventions.
                           “It is the thesis of this book that society can only be understood through a study of the messages and the communication facilities which belong to it; and that in the future development of these messages and communication facilities, messages between man and machines, between machines and man, and between machines and machines, are destined to play an ever increasing part” (Wiener, 1954, p. 16)
                        
                     

In 1954, considering messages between machines and machines was visionary and probably a little exotic. But 50–60 years later the situation has changed completely. While human-machine communication admittedly is critical for our daily existence – at work and at leisure – and while the importance of issues such as interface design, usability, and ‘intelligent’ devices is steadily growing, machine–machine communication goes unnoticed by many. The market predictions, however, recognise that this is a growing area, which is why it should also be a growing concern for HFE. Industry pundits and researchers estimate that there will be more than 6 billion wireless subscribers using smart phones by 2020. However, communication companies such as Ericsson predict that at that time there will also be over 50 billion intelligent machines, in large industrial installations, in small devices, in homes, in vehicles, and probably in every possible and impossible place as well. Apart from a fight for bandwidth, the 50 billion intelligent machines are likely to bring about such a ‘radical modification of our environment’ that we should start to think about it now – in the sanguine hope that the unintended consequences of these developments do not drown the effects of well-intentioned ergonomics design. The problem is no longer human interaction with machines, but rather human management of machines that massively interact with each other. As the recent lessons from computer-based trading have shown, we may soon find ourselves in the unenviable position of the sorcerer's apprentice.

The rest of this chapter will consider some issues raised in the paper by Dul et al. (2012) in the light of the above, in particular the suggestion that HFE should be seen as a systems science. The reason is that the issues presented by the paper represent widely shared views in the HFE community and that these views require some discussion.

Any such discussion must be based on a common understanding of what the subject of discussion is, in this case an understanding of what HFE is. To manage HFE, in the sense of managing its development as a science, it is necessary to know where one is (the present position), to know where one wants to be (the goal or target), and to know how to change from the present position in the direction of the target (the means). In the case of HFE, neither question is simple to answer.

While HFE certainly has the potential to shape artefacts “around the capacities and aspirations of humans”, this may not be the best possible starting point. Quite apart from the fact that it focuses on what HFE can do, rather than on what it is, it also represents a view that dates from the 1940s. The spirit of the times was captured when Paul Fitts formulated the function allocation problem as follows: “We begin with a brief analysis of the essential functions … We then consider the basic question: Which of these functions should be performed by human operators and which by machine elements?” (Fitts, 1951). But if the goal is to optimise human performance and well-being, this should refer to the conditions that exist today rather than the conditions that existed 50–60 years ago. Accepting Wiener's statement that we have ‘modified our environment so radically that we must now modify ourselves in order to exist in this new environment’, the starting point must be the human condition in the ‘modified’ environment as it is today and as it is likely to be in the near future. Only then can we determine whether design is an appropriate, or even the best, way to do it.

Under the heading “The fundamental characteristics of the HFE discipline and profession”, Dul et al. (2012) explains that “HFE focuses on systems in which humans interact with their environment” (p. 2). This is undoubtedly true. Indeed, in relation to work it is next to impossible to think an activity that does not involve some kind of interaction between humans and their environment. (One could almost say that it must be one of the premises for a definition of work.) Since systems where humans ‘interact with their environment’ clearly are ubiquitous, the important question becomes what is meant by the term ‘system’.

While the ‘system’ term is much in vogue, it is rarely explicitly defined, and there are often considerable differences in how it is interpreted and applied. Proposing that something should be called a systems discipline – or even a systems science – does not by itself lead to a better understanding or to more lucid descriptions. Neither can the answer be found in various scientific or lexical definitions of what a system is, although there are plenty to choose from. The can instead be found by looking at what characterises the typical work environments, and whether those characteristics are relatively stable.

HFE defines a system as follows:
                           “Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of the interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theoretical principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize well-being and overall performance.” (Dul et al., 2012, p. 3)
                        
                     

Here a system is described in the traditional manner as consisting of independent parts or elements that are interrelated in one way or another – acknowledging, of course, that the whole is larger than the sum of the parts. Compare this to the following:
                           “In systems engineering … the word ‘system’ is used simply as a label for something taken to exist in the world outside ourselves. The taken-as-given assumption is that the world can be taken to be a set of interacting systems, some of which do not work very well and can be engineered to work better. In the thinking embodied in the SSM
                                 3
                              
                              
                                 3
                                 SSM means Soft Systems Methodology.
                               the taken-as-given assumptions are quite different. The world is taken to be very complex, problematic, mysterious. However, our coping with it, the process of inquiry into it, it is assumed, can itself be organized as a learning system. Thus the use of the word ‘system’ is no longer applied to the world, it is instead applied to the process of our dealing with the world.” (Checkland, 2000, p. A10).
                        
                     

From a true systems theoretic or cybernetic perspective a system is defined as a set of mutually dependent functions, hence characterised by what it does rather than by what it is. Indeed, as the above quote argues, ‘systemic’ applies to how we describe the world as well as to the world that is being described. HFE can only be said to take a systems approach if it lives up to that ambition. But that is not the case today.

When considering the possible future of HFE, two facts must be recognised. The first is that the nature of work, and therefore also the work environments, have changed dramatically over the last century and that the rate of change is unlikely to diminish. It was not so long ago that most work places or work environments were distinct and recognisable even from photographs. Today, many work environments have become anonymous due to the influence of information technology and the domination of various design philosophies, such as the WIMP style and the now ubiquitous GUI. The nature of work has also changed from hands-on control and regulation or even direct manipulation, to monitoring and supervision – heavily supported by automation or even outright replaced by automation. In this transition the requirements (or constraints) from information technology have often mattered more than the demands of the actual tasks.

The second fact is that these changes notwithstanding, the vast majority of work places are very traditional. Most of the problems are described in the HFE literature and the solutions are exceedingly well known – by academics but not always by practitioners and industrial stakeholders. As a profession, we do indeed know how to design workplaces to achieve the desired human-system integration and the consequent improvements in performance and well-being. (Unfortunately, that does not mean that it is always done. But achieving that requires a change in attitudes and organisational culture, rather than basic research.)

One challenge for HFE practitioners is therefore to be better at doing what we know to do, i.e., be better at applying HFE knowledge and experience in practice. This is a daunting task because of the sheer size of it, rather than because the solutions are unknown. As long as HFE is considered an expendable add-on rather than an essential prerequisite for safe and productive work, this challenge will remain. Another challenge is to anticipate the new types of work that will arise (and some of which already exist), to foresee what work will be, but also to propose what work should be. This is a daunting task because it requires that HFE takes a critical look at itself and makes some bold choices.


                        Dul et al. (2012) emphasised that HFE is “design driven” and elaborated it as follows:
                           “HFE seeks to improve performance and well-being through systems design. Analyses and assessments result in recommendations and actions for this design. HFE can be involved in all stages of planning, design, implementation, evaluation, maintenance, redesign and continuous improvement of systems … These stages are not necessarily sequential; they are recursive, interdependent, dynamic, but design is at the heart of them. Decisions at one stage may affect or be affected by decisions at other stages.” (Dul et al., 2012, p. 4.)
                        
                     

While it is undeniable that design is an important part of the HFE toolbox, it is by no means the only tool available. Other important tools are training, automation, task/function distribution, and work management. Design should perhaps also be understood as the activity or process of designing, rather than as the design as a product or outcome. Designing means shaping or organising something in a specific way, so that it becomes easier to do. This emphasis on function rather than structure agrees with what Helander called the ‘action view’:
                           “This design orientation of HFE differentiates it from other disciplines such as sociology, and anthropology. These other disciplines may share a comprehensive view with HFE, but not an action view.” (Helander, 1997).
                        
                     

The question is, however, how far the design should extend, whether it should be limited to system elements, for instance interface design, or whether it should consider the system as a whole, for instance cognitive task design (Hollnagel, 2003). The designing issue is not unrelated to the system issue, since designing a workplace obviously must take into account the effects on the rest of the system. Consider, for instance, the design of interfaces. This has classically been seen as a part of HFE and has focused on such things as the anthropometrical, visual, and cognitive aspects. However, designing an interface also means designing how it is to be used, or in other words designing the task or activity, even though this is done indirectly. While the primary target of design often is the direct interaction with or use of the artefact – as in Human–Computer Interaction and Human–Machine Interaction – every artefact that we design and build has consequences for how it is used. These consequences can be seen both in the direct and concrete (physical) interaction with the artefact (predominantly manual work) and in how the use or interaction with the artefact is planned and organised (predominantly cognitive work). Thus, introducing a new ‘tool’ not only affects how work is done, but also how it is conceived of and organised. This will in most cases have consequences for other parts of work, and may lead to unforeseen changes with either manifest or latent effects. If HFE truly wants to take a systems approach, the purpose of design cannot be to engineer the ‘hard’ system to achieve well-defined objectives (Checkland, 2000). The purpose must rather be to tackle real-word problems where ends, goals, and purposes themselves are problematic.

In the established HFE perspective, the goal of HFE is to “improve performance and well-being through systems design”, as noted above. At first glance this seems entirely reasonable. The performance is, presumably, related to the output or product of work, referring to such issues as quality, efficiency, or safety. We all work to produce something – tangible outputs in some cases and intangible outputs in other cases – and unless there is a ‘market’ for what we produce, taking the term ‘market’ in its widest possible sense, the basis for the work will gradually be eroded. The well-being is in turn related to the physical and mental conditions of the persons who do the work, and represented by such things as stress, satisfaction, illness, pleasure, personal development, etc.

A little reflection, however, shows that the two outcomes occur on quite different time scales and have quite different dynamics. We know a lot about how to improve performance, and have developed well-established techniques to do that at least since the days of Scientific Management. (We also know that there are some paradoxical social issues, as shown by the Hawthorne effect.) And while designing work environments purely to increase performance efficiency always has been a little morally suspect, the introduction of kaizen made it more palatable. The ‘mechanisms’ that produce performance improvements are relatively well known, and the results are obtained with an insignificant delay and limited uncertainty. The same is, however, not the case for well-being. Well-being is a psychological, or mental, state, as much as it is a physiological one. There are many things that can affect it, and we do not know for sure which are the best nor how they exert their influence. While well-being may be affected by HFE design, the relation is indirect and involves considerable, but unknown, delays.

One result of taking a critical look at HFE may well be a revision of the traditionally accepted goal, cf., above. Instead of being the improvement of performance and well-being through hard system design, the goal could be to improve the ability to manage expected as well as unexpected work situations. If it becomes easier for people to make sense of their work, not in the sense of avoiding verfremdung but in the sense of being better able to understand what happens (as well as understanding what has happened and what will happen) and thereby cope more efficiently, then this will reduce the uncertainty of the work and increase people's ability to manage what they are doing.

While design in some sense can be seen as the main tool of both approaches, the ‘human use of human beings’ approach acknowledges from the start that there is an irreducible reciprocity or dependency between shaping the work environment and shaping work. Humans are admittedly the components or elements in a complicated socio-technical system; but by the same token they are also their own environment. This was recognised 25 years ago, when Flores et al., noted that:
                        “The design of new technology is always an intervention into an ongoing world of activity. It alters what is already going on – the everyday practices and concerns of a community of people – and leads to a resettling into new practices.” (Flores et al., 1988).
                     
                  

The strategy for HFE should therefore be to develop a competence that corresponds to the real world – to ‘work as done’ or ‘work as to be done’ rather than to ‘work as imagined’. If the variety of what HFE can offer does not correspond to the variety (uncertainty) that is out there, solutions will be ineffective and the uptake of HFE will eventually stall. HFE as it is practised now is arguable unable to do that because it is predicated on an inherited tradition, and because we rarely question whether this tradition is still valid or applicable. As concerned HFE practitioners – or even as concerned HFE academics – we need to do so, and we need to do it sooner rather than later.
