                  Multi-channel communication in a wireless mesh network (WMN) equipped with multi-radio routers can significantly enhance the network capacity. Channel allocation, power control and routing are three main issues involved in the performance of multi-channel multi-radio WMNs. In this paper, the joint optimization of channel allocation, power control and routing under signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) model for multi-channel multi-radio WMNs is investigated. It is proven to be NP hard. As we know, no optimal polynomial time solutions have been proposed in the previous literatures. In order to tackle this problem, we apply bio-inspired optimization techniques for channel allocation and power control, and use linear programming for routing optimization. To reflect the cross-layer interaction property among these three issues, the routing optimization is further defined as the fitness value of a chromosome in bio-inspired optimization. Further, we propose an effective joint optimization framework, in which two representative bio-inspired optimization methods (genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm) are hybridized to enhance the searching ability. The detailed evolution processes for both genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm are demonstrated. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges fast and approaches the sub-optimal solution effectively.
