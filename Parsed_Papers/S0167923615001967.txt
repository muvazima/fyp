                  The prevalence of social media has greatly catalyzed the dissemination and proliferation of online memes (e.g., ideas, topics, melodies, and tags). However, this information abundance is exceeding the capability of online users to consume it. Ranking memes based on their popularities could promote online advertisement and content distribution. Despite such importance, few existing work can solve this problem well. They are either daunted by unpractical assumptions or incapability of characterizing dynamic information. As such, in this paper, we elaborate a model-free scheme to rank online memes in the context of social media. This scheme is capable to characterize the nonlinear interactions of online users, which mark the process of meme diffusion. Empirical studies on two large-scale, real-world datasets (one in English and one in Chinese) demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme. In addition, due to its fine-grained modeling of user dynamics, this ranking scheme can also be utilized to explain meme popularity through the lens of social influence.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Meme (pronounced “meem”) was first coined by Richard Dawkin in analogy with gene in genetics four decades ago [1]. It is defined as “unit of conceptual replication” that identifies idea, topic or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. Like the natural selection of genes that confer ‘differential reproductivity’, memes also compete for our scarce individual and collective attention [2]. During this process, some of them quickly die out of popularity while others persist for a long period of time. In recent years, the advent of various social media platforms has lowered the cost of information generation, boosting the potential reach of each meme among online users. This information abundance is exceeding human capacity to consume it [3–5]. Therefore, an effective ranking scheme is imperative to focus human limited attention on the most important memes. Appropriate solutions for this issue would provide direct implications in refining online advertisement and content distribution. In online advertising, new revenue models could be developed to charge advertisers for the amount of attention that a meme will receive. In media outlets, ranking information can be used to highlight the most popular memes in realtime. These condensed results are especially beneficial in emergent situations where information fragments emerge at random moments, such as social events [6,7], public health [8,9], and political campaigns [10–12]. In light of such importance, meme ranking has attracted considerable research interests in various disciplines [2,13,14].

However, to the best of our knowledge, few existing studies provide an adequate solution for meme ranking task. Traditional bottom-up approaches attempt to construct various diffusion models in analogy to behavior replication [15–18], epidemic contagion [14,19–24], or competitive gaming [25,26]. Although these models can help to track the diffusion process and measure its fact on online users, their computational complexities are often comparatively high, sometimes even NP-hard [27]. Furthermore, oversimplifications made in these models, such as user homogeneity [2,16], static network structure [19], and finite interaction patterns [28,29], can lead to unrealistic or even misleading conclusions. Recently, several top-down approaches have been developed to characterize meme dynamics, which is critical in accessing the evolution and mutation of online memes [4]. These studies mainly focus on quantifying the topological centrality [30,31], content similarity [32], or user behaviors [13] based on large-scale datasets. This line of research has provided significant insights in understanding the trend of the web. Yet, lacking fine-grained modeling of user interactions in meme diffusion, they still cannot characterize meme dynamics well.

To solve the above challenges, in this paper, we elaborate a model-free ranking scheme that characterizes meme dynamics with few assumptions. Different from previous work, our ranking scheme is designed based on information theory and could capture complex meme dynamics without modeling its exact diffusion process. In addition, while most existing studies are concerned with aggregate measures for meme ranking, the scheme presented here allows more fine-grained characterization on information diffusion among online users. This key property enables us not only to rank meme at the macro level, but also to inquiry key factors determining meme popularity at the micro level. For evaluation, we have used two different genres of datasets: one from a Chinese microblogging system and the other one from an American political blog forum. Experimental results on these two datasets validate the efficiency and robustness of the scheme compared with several benchmark approaches. By examining two key factors pertaining to meme spreaders, we also uncover several principles governing meme popularity. These findings may provide both academic and industrial implications in understanding other new types of memes such as innovation [15], rumor [19], and viral marketing [14,28].

The remaining parts of the paper are structured as follows. Section 2 reviews existing studies most relevant to our task. In Section 3, the technical details for the proposed meme ranking scheme are represented. Section 4 gives the empirical results of our proposed scheme in comparison with several existing approaches. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper with a summary and a discussion about future research directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The original work regarding meme traces back to a theory proposed by Dawkin [1], who first coined the concept of meme. This concept is utilized to describe the potential process of information diffusion among online users, in analogy with gene in genetics. In the following part of this section, we will present the existing studies relevant to our work from two perspectives, including meme diffusion and meme ranking.

Existing studies concerning meme diffusion mainly focus on constructing various theoretical models from different views. These models can help us to uncover the potential evolutionary patterns of meme diffusion to a certain extent. Generally, these meme diffusion models can be roughly categorized into three groups, i.e., cascade models, epidemic models, and competitive models respectively.

One of the famous cascade models is proposed by Bikhchandani et al. [16], who explore social changes by assuming all users hold the same belief in behavior making. This assumption clearly does not hold in real-world situations. Kempe et al. [15] then study online innovation diffusion and try to maximize its influence among users by selecting a subset of key nodes. In their cascade model, dynamics of neighbor pairs are considered independently. In fact, user dynamics is highly interwoven. Models for multiple cascades have been studied by extending the existing independent cascade model. These models generally assume that the status of each node keeps intact once influenced by other nodes [17]. Myers and Leskovec [18] further infer social relations based on information propagation in latent social networks. Both the cascades and infections are postulated to be conditionally independent in their propagation model. One common drawback of all these work is that assumptions made in modeling clearly do not hold in real-world practice. In contrast, our model makes no explicit assumptions about information dynamics.

The epidemical analogy of information to virus has opened a new perspective for investigating meme diffusion and evolution. This, in turn, leads to pervasive applications of compartmental models such as SI, SIR, and SIS [20,21,33]. The spread of rumors and the detection for its source are studied with classical susceptible-infected (SI) model [19]. This model heavily depends on the network structure, which keeps developing and evolving. Some researchers study meme dynamics in the context of personal publishing. Gruhl et al. [23] employ snapshot models to depict topic propagation in blogspace. Their models are designed to characterize dynamics for both the communities and users. Article memes are studied by expressing complex human dynamics in analogy with infection by a virus [22]. These studies often assume the background environment as constant, which is not very practical in real world situations. In another strand of research, Richardson and Domingos [14] seek to optimize viral marketing plans by mining knowledge-sharing websites. In their probabilistic models, only one type of marketing action is considered. This simplicity may run counter to actual marketing scenarios.

To study meme competition among public attention, Weng et al. [2] employ a parsimonious agent-based model. However, their model highly relies on the underlying network structure and does not account for the discrepancy in user interest. Wei et al. [34] try to predict meme prevalence by considering network structural and information propagation at the same time. They assume that all nodes are passive and can be characterized with the same propagation model. Further, mixture of meme effect on individual is forbidden. Such postulation may not reflect the real situation in many circumstances. Goldenberg et al. [28] try to understand personal communications in word-of-mouth marketing. However, their complex system modeling technique could only cope with two types of predefined social interactions.

Though there is comprehensive work investigating meme diffusion, to the best of our knowledge, the existing studies concerning meme ranking are comparatively limited. In what follows, we present a brief survey for this line of research.

Ienco et al. [35] and Bonchi et al. [27] initially attempt to construct propagation models to rank memes, but find that these models are pragmatically unfeasible since their computational complexities are NP-hard. Consequently, they turn to employ several heuristic methods. However, these methods cannot distinguish the direction of information flow, which is crucial in determining user importance in meme diffusion. Different from their work, in this paper, we adopt an asymmetric measure that is capable of capturing the direction of information flow among users. In another line of research, Bauckhage [13] ranks memes according to their average daily activity. Since activity level is measured via relative value, the ranking result may be confounded by other memes beyond consideration. Thus, it is highly possible that meme activity increases while its portion drops due to the proliferation of unknown memes.

There also exist other studies trying to rank meme based on topological centrality measures, such as in/out-degree, and number of followers. Gloor [30] measures trends on the web based on betweenness centrality. This measure requires a complete collection of underlying network structure, which is impossible in most scenarios. PageRank is a centrality algorithm that has been used widely in network analysis and ranking related tasks. Rather than prioritizing authoritative blogs, Adar et al. [31] try to rank blogs from the perspective of information diffusion. To this end, they propose an iRank algorithm to rank blogs based on implicit link structure. Their approach requires additional resource to train a link predictor, whose performance highly relies on the quality of this resource. However, such resource is not always available in real world practice, thus limiting its applications on a wide scale. Gordevicius et al. [32] focus on ranking news stories. Instead of using hypertext-links, they construct implicit links based on content similarity. Their algorithm is computational expensive, since it is equivalent to obtaining the stationary distribution of a random walk over a whole graph. Besides, the ranking result varies based on the similarity measure used. In contrast, except for user behaviors, our approach does not need any extra information. In addition, it computational complexity is also acceptable.

Recently, studies on meme ranking turn to explore dynamic information. One of the significant studies is presented by Kwak et al. [36], who attempt to rank trending topics based on singleton, reply, mention, and retweet information. Since such information is highly topic-dependent, a reliable scheme is thus imperative. This constitutes the main motivation for our work in this paper.

This section describes our proposed scheme for meme ranking. We first elaborate the rational for the designed scheme, and then introduce its formulation and computation in turn.

Though meme ranking has attracted considerable attention and has been explored in different frameworks, existing ranking criteria are rather task dependent, and there still lack a theoretical guideline to measure meme popularity. Empirical analysis suggests that highly popular memes often associate with influential users spreading them [37]. We thus hope to design a scheme to rank meme based on the influence of users engaged in spreading it. Considering the variation in user volume of different memes, we propose to measure meme popularity based on the average influence of all users for each meme. This averaging manipulation is assumed to partially mitigate some confounding factors caused by external inference [38], unobserved heterogeneity [39], or some other contextual effects [40]. Then, the proposed ranking scheme can be formulated as:
                           
                              (1)

                                       ∑

                                          ∈
                                          
                                             U

                        where, Pop
                        
                           m
                         quantifies the popularity of meme m; U
                        
                           m
                         represents the collection of users participating in spreading it, and the operator ‘#’ measures the volume size of the set next to it; Influence(u) corresponds to the influence of user u.

Given the ranking scheme defined by Eq. (1), we proceed to identify influence for each online user, as discussed next.

Though influence identification has been explored relatively thoroughly in social dynamics, formulating it in a model-free manner is not done before. To deal with the problems with the previous Mutual Information-based approaches, we adopt the recently developed transfer entropy [41] concept to guide the design of our scheme since this approach is asymmetric and can capture arbitrary nonlinear interactions well. While various kinds of information can be utilized to measure user influence, in this ranking scheme, we choose to use user behaviors during meme diffusion process. This guarantees that the identified user influence is most relevant to meme dynamics. In what follows, we present our influence identification approach, which is a model-free strategy.

Suppose a pair of users x and y in online social media, whose behavior history can be approximated by two Markov processes X
                           =
                           x

Eq. (8) quantifies the amount of information that can be used to predict the behaviors of user x. This can be considered as a reflection of influence wielded by user y (Fig. 1). As Eq. (8) is defined in an asymmetric manner, it can thus be used to analysis user heterogeneity with regard to personal influence and investigate how it is related to meme popularity. This will be shown in the experiment section.

We now turn to estimate transfer entropy defined in Eq. (8). Considering finite date samples available, we adopt a bin-based approach used by Kaiser and Schreiber [43]. In our formulation, the behavior history of user x can be recorded in a time series:

To indicate whether user launches a behavior within a time span, a binned indicator function is introduced:

Given these notations, TE(Y→X) defined in Eq. (8) can be readily calculated. Because TE(Y→X) only depicts peer influence, the total influence Influence(Y) of user y is obtained by summarizing the total influence he wields on all others in the community.

Estimation based on limited data will lead to biases and statistical errors [44,45]. These errors mainly come from two sources: systematic deviation and statistical deviation. Systematic deviation is tackled with randomized experiments, as it will be discussed in Section 4. Here, statistical deviation can be eliminated mainly through two methods: ex-ante limitation and ex-post elimination. In the former, statistical deviation can be restrained to an arbitrary level with respect to the given dataset. Ex-post elimination, on the other hand, works by first estimating the bias itself, and then adjusting final result accordingly. Further, this method requires some general a priori knowledge (e.g., Panzeri–Treves bias estimate [46]), and works like a post hoc remedy. Thus, we consider ex-ante limitation more appropriate for our scenario of influence estimation.

In the proposed scheme, we use Simpson's rule [47] to estimate the influence defined in Eq. (8),which is formulated as:

Simpson's method approximates the target function via a “piecewise” quadratic. This means if a function is already quadratic, then the approximation will be exact. This property guarantees an unbiased estimation for user influence. In addition, Simpson's rule is computationally efficient since the computational complexity of estimating Eq. (8) is O(N
                           log(N)). This cost is acceptable for the meme ranking task.

In this section, we first introduce the datasets used for evaluation, and then describe the randomized trials used to alleviate systematic deviation. Finally, we present our experimental design and corresponding results.

We evaluate the proposed ranking scheme on two different genres of dataset: Sina Weibo

Sina Weibo is a Twitter-like microblogging system in China. With more than 40 million active users spreading approximately 100 million messages each day,
                              3
                           
                           
                              3
                              
                                 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo. Accessed on Apr. 1st, 2014.
                            this system is generally considered an ideal laboratory for investigating information contagion, especially for Chinese content. Of particular interest is the section of Sina Weibo named ‘Hot Topics’. In this section, trending topics are ranked according to their popularity among the public in China. Within each topic, a vast number of messages keep evolving and mutating as the topic flows through the network. In this scenario, a topic is an incarnation of meme, while the messages spreading along different threads are operational proxies to track its dynamics. In what follows, without ambiguity, we will use the term meme to refer to each topic in Sina Weibo.

To evaluate the meme ranking task, we crawled down all 10 memes in the ‘Hot Topics’ section. For each meme, we only collected the top 10 threads. As a huge number of messages are generated in each thread, there already manifests sufficient information about user behavior and its corresponding timestamp. Thus, this dataset (Weibo hereafter) is ideal for evaluating the meme ranking task. Statistical information for each meme in Weibo dataset is shown in Table 1
                           . Table 1 suggests that each meme comprises at least 19,000 messages and users. This is a big enough dataset for our evaluation.

Daily Kos is an American political blog that enable users to publish news and share opinions liberally. This site was founded in 2002, and soon became the premier online political discussion community with 2.5 million visitors per month.
                              4
                           
                           
                              4
                              In 2009, Time magazine readers nominated this site as the second best blog platform.
                            On this blog platform, professional political writers post directly to the front page, while other regular users can post “diaries”. In responses to these front page entries and diaries, users write comments and make recommendations, thus driving topics spreading in the community. Ultimately, fiercely discussed diaries will be assigned a specific tag, and popular tags will be ranked in a ‘HOT TAGS’ section in the front page. In this blog community, we consider the hot tags as popular memes. Hereafter, meme will be used interchangeably with tag in Daily Kos.

To construct the evaluation dataset, we crawled down the top 10 hot tags with the 200 most recent diaries. For each diary, we also collected all the related comments and timestamps. Table 2
                            summarizes the statistics for Daily Kos dataset (Kos hereafter). Compared with Table 1, we find that users in Kos are more contributive by generating more messages (about 20 times higher). This trait may lead to different ranking results from those in Weibo, as will be investigated in following experiments.

To tackle the systematic deviation caused by multiple sources of bias, we design a randomized trial to minimize the potential negative effects. Our strategy is similar to He et al. [48], but comparatively practical and effective: we randomly sample user behaviors with corresponding timestamps for Weibo and Kos respectively.

                           In randomized trials, we did not conduct randomized selection on the threads for each meme, for threads ranked higher tend to have more reposts and engaged users. Randomized selection on meme threads may undermine information abundance for tracking memes and measuring their popularity.
                         To avoid data sparsity, users who have less than 2 behavior records have been be pruned out.

This procedure brings four main benefits. First, it alleviates the effects of selection bias, such as crawling strategy, and time point for data collection. Second, it guarantees that the sampled data are representative enough for the whole volume. Third, it statistically mitigates the effect of data incompleteness. Finally, it controls the inferences brought about by information leakage [49]. As users may be exposed to multiple memes at one time, randomized manipulation can offset such inferences with systematic expectation.

In the following experiments, we execute 10 independent randomized samplings for each approach, and the experimental results are averaged across all the runs. If not explicitly stated otherwise, we adopt a sampling rate of 5%.

In the following sections, we investigate meme ranking task by studying three major issues:

                              ranking performance. We explore how the proposed ranking scheme performs on two large-scale, real-world datasets.

ranking robustness. We examine the robustness of the ranking scheme by testing whether its performance is sensitive to different sampling rates.

popularity factors. We quantify two factors related to user heterogeneous, and dissect how they influence meme popularity.

To quantify user influence in the proposed ranking scheme, we employ repost behavior and comment behavior respectively in Weibo and Kos. In parameter settings, for all following experiments, we take m
                           =
                           n
                           =3 in Eq. (8) as the Markovian order for user behaviors. According to our empirical analysis, higher values do not give better performance, yet only improves computational cost. Considering the long tail phenomenon in online social behaviors [50–52], as well as the varying observation periods in different datasets, we divide time bins of user behavior elastically by selecting δ0
                           =0.01T,δ1
                           =0.1T,andδ2
                           =0.2T respectively,

                              6
                              In our datasets, this setting for bin widths fixes the finest temporal resolution for recent records of user behaviors and coarser for historical ones.
                            where T is the total observation period in a dataset.

For an objective evaluation on meme ranking results, we conduct experiments under two criteria: Edit Distance [53] based criterion and Kendall-tau Distance [54] based criterion. Gold standard is chosen as the ranking result of memes from the original website. In the following experiments, we clarify whether we can predict this result merely based on partial dataset available from the website.

Kendall tau Distance is a ranking metric defined as the number of pairwise disagreements between two rankings [55–57]. Due to its advantages in computability and interpretability, Kendall tau Distance has been used widely in information retrieval to evaluate ranking quality [55,58–60]. Given two lists L

                              2, the Kendall tau Distance between them is:

Edit Distance is an alternative criterion used in evaluating ranking result. It is defined based on the Levenshtein distance, thus sensitive to item positioning in ranking. This trait enables close dissection on the difference between the gold standard and the ranking for evaluations.

Also, we convert the original value given by the Edit Distance to a normalized similarity score:

Previous studies have employed different topological characteristics of social networks to measure social influence, such as the in/out-degree [61] and PageRank [62]. Here, we use follower number to quantify user influence. Despite its simplicity, follower number is considered as a rational indicator of user influence since following links determine the flow of information [63] and more following links means more opportunities to influence others. More sophisticated algorithms might yield better results, and we will examine one of them later. Given these analytics, for each meme m, its overall popularity score Pop_FollowNr

                               represents the collection of users engaged in spreading meme m, Follower(u) is the collection of all followers of user u, and the operator ‘#’ measures the volume size of the set next to it.

PageRank is an alternative metric for quantifying user influence. Apart from the number of links, PageRank also accounts for their qualities. Thus, PageRank is assumed to outperform follower number based approaches. However, PageRank requires explicit knowledge of the underlying network structure as a priori. Actually, an accurate characterization of the network structure is almost impossible as it changes and evolves continuously. In addition, network structure is usually meme independent. Thus, it seems inappropriate to rank online memes by utilizing PageRank directly.

To tackle this issue, we construct two social networks based on user behavior information, which is readily accessible and meme dependent. Taking each user as a node in the network, we consider there is an edge starting from user u to user v if u reposts (in Weibo) or comments (in Kos) a message of v. Statistics of the two constructed networks is shown in Tables 3 and 4
                              
                               respectively. We notice that network density [64] in Kos dataset is higher (approximately 2 times as that in Weibo). This may be attributed to high level user contribution in meme diffusion.

Based on the constructed social networks, we then execute the PageRank algorithm. The popularity score of meme m is calculated as the average PageRank value of each user:

Again, a meme's popularity score is moderated by an averaging procedure.

Recent studies suggest that static structural measures alone reveal very little about social influence [65,66], while more accurate quantification requires characterizing on dynamic processes [67]. Thus, we design to measure user influence by utilizing the dynamic user behavior information. According to Romero et al. [66], the action rates vary widely across users, and a relatively small portion of them play a key role in meme diffusion. This finding prioritizes the necessity of quantifying user activity level for more accurate influence identification. As such, we use the number of repost (in Weibo) and comment (in Kos) behaviors to measure user activity level.

                                 Within each meme, it is possible for a user to repost or comment multiple times as there are many different variations of one original message.
                               The popularity score of meme m is then formulated as:

Apart from user activity, some researchers also employ user passivity [66] (or susceptibility [68] from the opposite point of view) to measure the resistance in influencing others. Aral and Walker [68] suggest that influential users, usually active in information diffusion, are less susceptible to influence. However, user passivity should not be considered as a directly opposite perspective to user activity, as they are totally different metrics for depicting the same user. Further research is needed to determine whether influence based on user passivity will rank memes differently from that based on user activity. This issue is beyond the current research scope and will be considered in our future work.

Following Bonchi et al. [27] and Goyal et al. [69], we also quantify influence Influ(u,
                              v) exerted by user u on user v based on the probability that each post generated by u will be further consumed by v.

Traits of the above benchmark approaches are summarized in Table 5

@&#RESULTS@&#

In designing the meme ranking task, we attempt to evaluate whether the proposed ranking scheme can predict meme popularity (as indicated by the original website) merely based on partial data available. This task is meaningful as it informs the possibility of either ranking memes with limited data samples at a specific timestamp, or predicting future meme popularity based on historical data samples. In this paper, we mainly focus on the former situation and experimental results are shown in Tables 6 and 7
                           
                           .

Primarily, we notice two contradictions to our empirical expectation. First, PageRank group fails to outperform Follower_Num group. Since it is structure dependent, we contemplate this result may be attributed to the reconstructed social network, which is highly biased due to limited data samples. The superiority of Follower_Num over PageRank implies that structural information is more reliable in meme ranking with limited data samples.

Second, Dynamic group fails to perform better than the Follower_Num group in both datasets. This result is inconsistent with previous work that assumes dynamic information is more reliable than structural information in depicting information dynamics [63]. In turn, it indicates that meme popularity, at least in the current situation, is reflected more by the long-term status of a user's social network geometry [70], while less by their short-term communication relationship. This superficially uncanny fact can be understood by delving into the underlying interaction network. An individual's social network mainly constitutes of two parts, i.e., explicit following relationships and implicit communication avenues [71]. Explicit social relation reflects one's long-term status in a community, and implicit communication avenues reflects his short-term prestige, which is highly event dependent (e.g., spreading a specific meme). In the situation where data samples are incomplete, dynamic information turns to be unreliable while explicit social networks become more predictable for social influence, and ultimately for meme popularity.

Apart from the above contradictions, we also notice that the proposed scheme outperforms the four benchmark approaches under both evaluation criteria. Specially, we notice that most of the benchmark approaches do not consider the meme “Yong lovers” (ID=1) as the most popular meme in Weibo dataset (Table 1). This meme corresponds to an untimely death of a lovelorn teenager. Though the absolute number of messages generated in diffusing this meme is not the highest, it does exert intense influence among online users, where fierce discussions develop. While the benchmark approaches merely rely on network structure (constructed either statically or dynamically) for ranking, our proposed scheme quantifies influence among users in a model-free manner with high accuracy. This capability enables our scheme to captures complex nonlinear social interactions through both explicit social networks and implicit communication avenues. Similar situation occurs in the meme “Margaret Thatcher Dies” (ID=8) in Weibo dataset (Table 1). Though this meme receives a low ranking position from both the official website and the four benchmark approaches, it is found to has been gaining momentum in the following several days when other memes already lose popularity. Our ranking scheme ‘predicts’ this meme's future popularity, while other approaches only rank meme temporarily without any forecast. Similar findings are also found in Kos dataset, thus further validating our conclusions.

Finally, there is one point worth mentioning for the evaluation criteria. Though Kendall-tau_Sim generally gives higher scores (p<0.01 according to a two-tailed paired t-test), Edit_Sim is more sensitive to meme positioning in ranking. This fact is indicated by the higher relative error between the maximal and the minimal ranking scores given by Edit_Sim (about 2 times higher than that given by Kendall-tau_Sim). This disparity enables us to investigate meme ranking task from different perspectives. The consistency in ranking results under these two criteria strengthens the soundness of previous conclusions derived.

As sampling manipulation has been adopted in randomized trials, we next explore whether our scheme is robust with respect to the sampling rate. By comparing ranking performance at different sampling rates, we can validate the possibility of predicting meme popularity with only partial data available. In this subsection, we run several simulations with distinct sampling rates, and record the corresponding performance (Tables 8 and 9
                           
                           ). The maximum sample rate in this experiment is set to 20%. We believe this is the upper allowable bound for sampling as larger values may exacerbate the representativeness of the sampled dataset.

Results from Tables 8 and 9 suggest that the ranking results are insensitive to different sampling rates. In Weibo dataset, the average scores of Kendall-tau_Sim and Edit_Sim are 0.702 (±0.041) and 0.380 (±0.084) respectively. In Kos dataset, the standard deviation is only slightly larger, with average Edit_Sim 0.420 (±0.083) and Kendall-tau_Sim 0.830 (±0.057). These results prove the robustness of our ranking scheme by insensitive to changes in the underlying network structure. This trait distinguishes our scheme from benchmark approaches that are structure-dependent. Also, the results validate the possibility of ranking memes reliably with only finite data samples.

Popular memes are assumed to possess certain competitive advantages. In this subsection, we attempt to explore two factors contributing to meme popularity.

Bakshyet et al. [37] allege that information diffusion is driven by influential users. Thus, we first study how such users contribute to a meme's popularity. Specifically, we are interested in the portion of users (α
                           
                              m

In following experiments, we analyze the respective correlation of α
                           
                              m

                            between meme popularity. Experimental results are shown in Tables 10 and 11
                           
                           .

It turns out that memes with higher popularity scores tend to associate with larger α
                           
                              m
                           . Pearson's Correlation Coefficient between them is 0.453 in Weibo and 0.609 in Kos.
                              8
                           
                           
                              8
                              Considering the limited data samples we used, these correlation values are relatively high.
                            This means the popularity of a meme is achieved by involving a wide scale of users with moderate influence. Put another way, just a small amount of high influential users is insufficient to guarantee a meme's prevalence. Taking meme 6 and meme 8 in Weibo dataset as an example,
                              9
                           
                           
                              9
                              We also experimented with Kos data, and observed similar results.
                            meme 6 (Fig. 2-a) comprises a portion of high influential users, with the highest influence exceeding 20. However, this portion is relatively small (αm
                           
                           =2.666%), and there is a sharp drop in user influence for the remainder of the distribution. On the other hand, the influence distribution of meme 8 (Fig. 2-b) is much smoother (αm
                           
                           =45.127%), with few users possessing prohibitively high influence. This difference makes meme 8 more popular among the public. Thus, users are more likely to be exposed to and influenced by it, and are more willing to spread it. This finding (finding 1) coincides with previous postulation that information diffusion can also be realized by moderate or less influential users; indeed, sometimes they even do a better job [37].

By comparing columns 2 and 4 in Table 10, we observe that popular memes are likely to contain fewer zero-influence users (finding 2). Pearson's Correlation Coefficient between them is –0.687, which suggests a relatively strong negative relationship. This phenomenon can be explained partly by the concept of re-diffusion intention [72] in marketing. Under its theoretical framework, if a meme is really popular, then the re-diffusion intention of users is high, and other users are more likely to be exposed to this meme. Hence, the probability that users release no influence by spreading the meme is low.

Likewise, we find a similar phenomenon in Table 11, but Pearson's Correlation Coefficient is comparatively low, only −0.254. As memes in Kos generally have much higher influence level than that in Weibo, the existence of relative small portion of zero-influence users might not affect meme popularity much. Thus, the correlation between meme popularity and ratio of zero-influence users is low.

The above findings are obtained because of our scheme's fine-grained modeling of user dynamics. These results may not be found if we only utilize the existing approaches. As the scheme makes no domain-specific assumptions, our work can be readily generalized to analyze other new types of memes, such as innovation [15], rumor [19], and viral marketing [14,28].

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

In this paper, we proposed a novel model-free scheme for meme ranking. Empirical studies on two large-scale real world datasets validate its efficiency and robustness. This scheme can provide us significant insights into understanding the meme popularity due to its fine-grained modeling of user dynamics. By analyzing two key factors regarding the user influence, we uncover two significant findings: (1) the meme popularity is achieved by a wide scale of users on its diffusion trace, while just a small amount of high influential users is insufficient; (2) more popular memes are prone to contain less zero-influence users.

In our future work, we intend to investigate whether other types of dynamic information also contribute to meme ranking task, such as user passivity and adoption rate. As only user behaviors are considered in quantifying user dynamics, we wonder whether the patterns of user behaviors bear some relationship with meme ranking results. Further, we will investigate whether involving contextual information and the behavioral and cognitive factors of online users would predict the meme popularity more accurately.
