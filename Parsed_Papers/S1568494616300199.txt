               Abstract
               
                  Giri et al. [P.K. Giri, M.K. Maiti, M. Maiti, Fully fuzzy fixed charge multi-item solid transportation problem, Applied Soft Computing, 27 (2015) 77–91] proposed an approach for solving mathematical programming of fully fuzzy fixed charge multi-item solid transportation problems (FFFCMISTP) and claimed that it is better to use their proposed approach as compared to the existing method [A. Kumar, J. Kaur, P. Singh, A new method for solving fully fuzzy linear programming problems, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 35 (2011) 817–823]. The aim of this note is to point out that Giri et al. have used some mathematical incorrect assumptions in their proposed approach and hence the claim of Giri et al. is not valid.
