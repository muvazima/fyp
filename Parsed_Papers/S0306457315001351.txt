@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  Many problems in data mining involve datasets with multiple views where the feature space consists of multiple feature groups. Previous studies employed view weighting method to find a shared cluster structure underneath different views. However, most of these studies applied gradient optimization method to optimize the cluster centroids and feature weights iteratively and made the final partition local optimal. In this work, we proposed a novel bi-level weighted multi-view clustering method with emphasizing fuzzy weighting on both view and feature. Furthermore, an efficient global search strategy that combines particle swarm optimization and gradient optimization was proposed to solve the induced non-convex loss function. In the experimental analysis, the performance of the proposed method was compared with five state-of-the-art weighted clustering algorithms on three real-world high-dimensional multi-view datasets.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In real-world applications, data are often collected from multiple sources or represented by multiple feature spaces. For example, web pages usually consist of both page-text and the hyper-links pointing to them, as well as images are often represented by multiple color and texture descriptors (Blum & Mitchell, 1998; Kriegel et al., 2011). Multiple views often provide compatible and complementary information for pattern discovery, so it is natural to integrate them together to obtain better performance rather than relying on a single view (Liu et al., 2013). On the other hand, multiple views are derived from integration of multiple types of measurements from different perspectives, different views could have very different statistical properties and produce different partitions, so tackling disagreement among views is crucial for multi-view clustering (Christoudias et al., 2008).

Surprisingly, some previous work on multi-view clustering relies on a core assumption that all views are compatible to each other, i.e. all views are considered as equally important and different views agree on a consensus partition (Bickel & Scheffer, 2004; Chaudhuri et al., 2009; Kumar & Daumé III, 2011; Long et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2014). For example, the co-training based methods are based on the assumption that the true underlying clustering would assign corresponding points in each view to the same cluster (Kumar & Daumé III, 2011; Zhao et al., 2014). Observing this assumption may lead to performance degradation when noisy or irrelevant views exist, many recent work applied a simple yet efficient method view weighting, i.e. each view is assigned a positive weight to express its importance (Cai et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013; 2012; Liu et al., 2013; Tzortzis & Likas, 2012; 2010; Yin et al., 2015).

Although various existing methods indeed improve the multi-view clustering performance, they often only capture view-wise relationship and ignore the feature-wise importance. For example, Tzortzis and Likas (2012) applied a kernel matrix to each view and then assigned a weight for each kernel; Liu et al. (2013) assigned a weight for each view in the non-negative matrix factorization(NMF) based multi-view clustering; Cai et al. (2013) improved the performance of k-means on multi-view big data also by view weighting. Fortunately, some most recent work discriminated view and weight simultaneously. For example, each view and feature were endowed a weight to represent their respective importance and a negative entropy constraint was imposed on each of them (Chen et al., 2013). The similar idea was implemented using joint structured sparsity-inducing norms, which is often used in multi-task learning (Wang et al., 2013). However, the negative entropy constraints and regulation terms of sparsity-inducing norms make the objective function non-convex and non-smooth, so it is difficult to solve them in general.

Inspired by recent advance in multi-view clustering and heuristic optimization, this work proposes a novel weighting method with emphasizing fuzzy weighting on both view and feature. In addition, an efficient hybrid optimization strategy based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gradient-descent method is introduced to solve this problem. PSO is a classical global search algorithm that emulates social interaction and individual cognition of bird flocks foraging (Kennedy & Eberhart, 1995). Compared with complex genetic algorithm, PSO has less algorithm parameters yet provides comparable optimization performance. In our previous work, a cooperative PSO is designed for high-dimensional data clustering (Jiang & Wang, 2013). In this paper, this method is extended to the scenario of multi-view clustering. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows.

                        
                           •
                           In problem modelling, a fuzzy weighting schema is proposed to assign weights for both views and features simultaneously. Then, these weights are coupled within the Euclidean distance function to compute the intra-cluster similarity.

In problem solving, an iterative hybrid algorithm based cooperative particle swarm optimization and gradient descent optimization is developed to find the best cluster centroids and weight vectors.

A parameter selection method inspired by Clustering Using REpresentative (CURE) (Guha et al., 2001) is proposed and evaluated in this work.

In experimental evaluation, we verify the effectiveness of our method with comparison experiments against five state-of-the-art weighting-based clustering algorithm on three real world datasets.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The related work is given in Section 2. Then, the proposed clustering objective function and the hybrid optimization algorithm are given in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. The parametric study and performance evaluation are provided in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Finally, Section 7 concludes this paper.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

Existing work in multi-view clustering can be broadly classified into three categories. Algorithms in the first category utilize all views simultaneously to discover hidden patterns (Abhishek Kumar, 2011; Bickel & Scheffer, 2004; Kumar & Daumé III, 2011; Liu et al., 2013; de Sa, 2005). In contrast, approaches from the second category first cluster each view independently and then combine the individual clustering results to produce a final partition (Bruno & Marchand-Maillet, 2009; Greene & Cunningham, 2009; Long et al., 2008). The methods in the last category first find a lower space through space transformation and then apply clustering algorithm to learn a partition (Blaschko & Lampert, 2008; Chaudhuri et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2007; Qi & Davidson, 2009).


                     Centralized approaches. Bickel and Scheffer (2004) proposed a two-view EM algorithm that based on co-EM algorithm. Their method first computes expectations for hidden variables in one view and then use these value in the M-step for the other view. Unfortunately, this algorithm is not guaranteed to converge. Kumar and Daumé III (2011) proposed a multi-view spectral clustering algorithm that extend idea of co-regulation to multi-view environment to make the clusterings in different views agree with each other. Abhishek Kumar (2011) also adopted a co-training framework such that the similarity matrix in one view is affected by the similarity estimated based on the eigenvectors of Laplacian matrix in the other view. Their method is based on the assumption that the true underlying clustering would assign corresponding points in each view to the same cluster.


                     Distributed approaches. Long et al. (2008) proposed a distributed multi-view clustering approach that first learns hidden patterns individually from each representation of multi-view data and then finds a optima hidden pattern from those multiple patterns. A main challenge of distributed approach is how to make the patterns in different views comparable. They introduce the concept of mapping function to seek an optimal pattern which is close to all patterns as much as possible under a certain distance measure. Greene and Cunningham (2009) applied NMF to lately integrate the original membership matrix that produced on each view separately. The factorization process is regarded as an optimization problem that minimizes the error between the original membership matrix and the reconstructed one. Bruno and Marchand-Maillet (2009) introduced a probabilistic latent semantic analysis(PLSA) clustering approach that based on the latent modelling of inter-cluster relationships. Both EM and NMF were applied to estimate the PLSA parameters and obtained comparable clustering quality.


                     Space transformation approaches. Blaschko and Lampert (2008) proposed a correlational spectral clustering algorithm, in which kernel canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to find a projection of the multiple views. Chaudhuri et al. (2009) also applied CCA to project multi-view data into a lower-dimensional subspace. Moreover, the empirical results in both of them indicated that CCA-based algorithms consistently provided better performance than PCA-based methods on several quite different multi-view datasets. Qi and Davidson (2009) developed a data transformation approach that converts the original data using a distance metric represented by a transformation matrix, which is obtained by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the probability density functions of the original data and the transformed data.

Overall, although many multi-view clustering methods are recently developed and make use of weighting to improve clustering performance, they often focus on capturing view-wise relationship and ignores the difference among features. In addition, although weighting methods provided an efficient strategy to handle view disagreement, the induced optimization function is non-convex function that contains several local optima.

                      is the cluster centroids. Although the classical k-means clustering can be used for multi-view clustering directly, such multi-view clustering objective fails to discriminate the feature and view, and its performance is significantly affected by noises. To discriminate both the feature and view, a feature weight w and view weight v are assigned to each feature and view, respectively. The induced optimization model of this strategy is as follows.

                      is the view weight. The α and β, used to control the weight distributions, are two fuzzy exponents that need to be provided by user. Although the two parameters are difficult to tune, they can prevent our algorithm from clustering on only single feature in single view. The basic idea of bi-level weighting is also shown in Fig. 1
                     (a).

The difficulty of solving the proposed constraint optimization problem comes from the following two aspects. First of all, the mathematical model in Eqs. (2) and (3) is a non-convex constrained optimization problem. In addition, we need to learn the weights during the clustering process. In the objective function Eqs. (2), the unknown variables are 
                        
                           U
                           ,
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Z
                           ,
                        
                     
                     
                        W
                      and 
                        
                           V
                           ,
                        
                      respectively. To the best of our knowledge, there is no efficient method that can optimize the four variables simultaneously. Alternatively, we can solve the induced problem iteratively. A three-stage hybrid optimization strategy is used in this work. Fig. 1(b) shows the idea of the proposed hybrid optimization algorithm. In Stage 1, we fix the two weight variables

Given the view weight V
                        * and feature weight W
                        *, the objective function in Eq. (2) is equivalent to the intra-cluster distance function that often used in k-means algorithm. Considering the NP-hardness of Euclidean sum-of-squares clustering (Aloise et al., 2009) and the high-dimensional feature space of dataset (Hou et al., 2013), a Cooperative Particle Swarm Clustering (CPSC) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, the original clustering problem is decomposed to K sub-problems according to the number of clusters, then each of these sub-problems evolved by a separate PSO sub-population. As each sub-population is evolved, the remaining sub-populations are held fixed. Please see (Jiang & Wang, 2013) for more details about CPSC, and two important procedures of CPSC are described as follows.


                        Subproblems optimization. Most of existing works used original PSO to search the best centroids. Instead of using original PSO, we adopt a more simple yet efficient PSO in which Gaussian distribution is used to generate the new positions. This Gaussian distribution based PSO is called bare-bone particle swarm optimization (BPSO) (Kennedy, 2003). Compared to three additional parameters in the original PSO, BPSO only has one additional parameter need to be given by user. In BPSO, each particle i updates its position by learning from its personal best position (pbest)

Most recent study by Blackwell (2012) showed the swarm gives the fastest convergence without any collapse when θ is set to 0.65, which is also employed in this work.


                        Subproblem coevolution. The above BPSO is applied in each sub-population to find the best solution of each sub-problem, which only represents a single cluster centroid of partition. However, the problem exists that we can not directly compute the fitness of each individual in a single population considered in isolation. Therefore, collaborators need be selected from each of the other populations to generate a complete solution. This work uses a greedy strategy, selecting the best individual from each of the other populations as the collaborators. For partitional clustering, to evaluate the fitness of all individuals in population

After all individual in population j have been evaluated once, selecting the individual with the minimum intra-cluster distance (fitness) as the best individual of population j, if its fitness is better than the previous best one. Then, the best individual of population j is selected as a member of collaborators and used for evaluating individuals in population

The proof of Theorem 2 is similar to the proof of Theorem 1. As depicted in Algorithm 1, the above three steps are iteratively executed in this work to minimize the objective function in Eq. (2).
                     

According to the Theorems 1 and 2, the range of the two fuzzy exponents α and β that used to control the distribution of view and feature weights can be obtained. In Eqs. (5) and (15), Ej
                         and Dh
                         are the intra-cluster variance in jth feature and hth view, respectively. In the propose algorithm, we desire such α that the larger Dh
                         of a view the smaller its weight, and we also desire such β that the larger Ej
                         of a feature the smaller its weight. Take α as an example to discuss the influence of the two parameters. For 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              1
                              ,
                           
                         according to Eq. (15), the clustering is made by the selection of one view, which is not desirable in real-world multi-view clustering problems. For 0 < α < 1, according to Eq. (15), the larger the Dh
                         of hth view the greater its weight, which is contradicted with the purpose of fuzzy weighting. Lastly, for α > 1, it is obvious that the view with larger intra-cluster variance will be assigned a smaller weight, which is reasonable in the proposed algorithm. Similarly, β > 1 is also feasible for feature weight.

In this section, we first conduct empirical study to investigate the effect of the fuzzy exponent α and β, then propose an efficient method to determine them. To do this, a synthetic and two real-world multi-view datasets are used for evaluation. Some properties of the three datasets are described as following and summarized in the first three rows of Table 1
                     .

                        
                           •
                           Synthetic dataset: This synthetic dataset contains 800 objects, each of which contains three views and six features. The first view contains two features that generated from four independent Gaussian distributions (Fig. 2
                              (a)). The second view contains the Gaussian white noise that added into the first two features (Fig. 2(b)). The third view consists of the value-missing version of the two features in the first view (Fig. 2(c)). All the noise level and the number of missing values are set to be equivalent in each feature. The aim of this dataset is to investigate in what condition the proposed algorithm can recognize the noise and irrelevant views.

Image Segmentation: this dataset consists of 2310 objects drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor images. This dataset contains 19 features that can be naturally divided into two views: shape view (the first 9 features) and RGB view (the last 10 features).

Water Treatment Plant: this dataset comes from the daily measures of sensors in an urban waste treatment plant. It contains 527 objects and 38 features. The 38 features can be divided into 4 views: input view (the first 22 features), output view (23th–29th features), performance input view (30th–34th features) and global performance input view (the last 4 features).

To investigate the influence of α and β to the two weight v and w, we set α and β as {0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 50, 60, 70} and run the proposed algorithm on the synthetic dataset. The population size of CPSC is 100 and the maximal fitness evaluation is 104. We first fixed any of the two parameters and investigate the other one. From Fig. 3
                        (a), we can see that, a small α leads a imbalance distribution of view weights, and each view becomes more uniform when α increases. The same tendency can be observed in Fig. 3(b), in which the influence of β to feature weight distribution is depicted. Theoretically, for a function like 
                           
                              f
                              
                                 (
                                 x
                                 )
                              
                              =
                              
                                 x
                                 α
                              
                           
                         with base x ∈ (0, 1) and exponent α > 1, the larger α the more compact of f(x) under different x. Fig. 4
                         shows the impact of different exponents α to the function value f(x). We can easily observe that a small exponent value such as 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              2
                           
                         produces diverse f(x) value, and a large exponent value such as 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              32
                           
                         makes the f(x) uniform under almost all x values. This simple theoretical analysis verifies the tendency depicted in Fig. 3.

In Fig. 3(a), we can easily observe that, there is a obviously weight difference for each view when 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              2
                           
                        . Specifically, the weight of the first view(cluster view) is larger than 0.7, and weights for the other two view are both less than 0.2. This distribution means that the first view is the most important for the synthetic dataset. This result is reasonable because we put some noisy in the second view and deleted some feature value in the third view. Therefore, if we knew priori that there are some noisy or irrelevant views (features) in the dataset, then it is better to set relative small α(β), otherwise, a large one is better.

From above analysis, we found that different combinations of α and β can produce significantly different weight distribution, which will finally affect clustering results. So, how to determine the best parameters for different datasets is crucial for the proposed algorithm. In most cases, algorithm needs to be executed many times on the whole dataset under different parameter combinations and the combination with the highest clustering performance is selected as the best one. Obviously, this method has poor scalability when the data volume and feature space increase. Inspired by hierarchical clustering algorithm CURE (Clustering Using REpresentative) (Guha et al., 2001), we randomly sample representative objects from dataset and run parameter selection experiments on them. For a dataset with N objects, assume that the probability of missing a cluster r is low if the sample (population) contains at least θ|r| objects(individuals), where 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1 and |r| is the size of cluster r. We have the following theorem.

                              then the probability that the sample contains fewer than θ|r| objects belonging to cluster r is less than δ, 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1 .
                           

The above theorem have been proved using Chernoff bounds in Guha et al. (2001). In this paper, we assume that the smallest cluster is a half of the average cluster size 
                           
                              N
                              K
                           
                         and require the sample contain at least two objects from the smallest cluster. Under these two assumptions, we can derive the following equation for the minimum sample size.

                        It is obviously that the sample size is only related to the K and the probability δ. If we set 
                           
                              δ

                         the minimum sample size for synthetic dataset, image segmentation and water treatment plant are 104, 182 and 130, respectively.

Experimental study was conducted here to prove the Theorem 3 is appropriate for our parameter selection task. To do this, we first ran the proposed algorithm with different parameter combinations on the original dataset of the synthetic dataset, image segmentation and water treatment plant dataset. Then, the algorithm was ran on the representatives of the three dataset. The clustering accuracy of the proposed algorithm under different α and β combinations on the three datasets are plotted in Fig. 5
                        . The clustering accuracy in complete dataset are provided in Fig. 5(a)–(c), and clustering accuracy in representatives are depicted in Fig. 5(d)–(f). From Fig. 5, no matter for complete dataset or representatives, when β increased to a certain degree the accuracy differences were very small in most cases that α > 2. From another perspective, also no matter for complete dataset or representatives, the lowest accuracy was always generated by algorithm with 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0
                           
                         (red line marked with inverted triangle) in most cases. Note that 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0
                           
                         means all views have the same weight. This observation tell us that, for these three multi-view dataset not all views are equally important for clustering and the view weighting is necessary.

If we compare the two figures in each row of Fig. 5, we find that the algorithm exhibited exactly similar performance on each dataset and its representatives. In Fig. 5(a) and (d), both the highest accuracies were achieved the when 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              2
                           
                         and 
                           
                              β
                              =
                              0
                           
                        . In Fig. 5(b) and (e), when 
                           
                              α
                              =

                         and β > 16 the algorithm performed very well on both the complete image segmentation dataset and representatives. In Fig. 5(c) and (f), the algorithm provided high accuracies when α ≥ 0 and β ≥ 16 in both cases.

Furthermore, we set α and β in each reasonable range according to Fig. 5, to investigate the best weight distribution provided by the proposed algorithm with different parameter combinations. Fig. 6
                         illustrates the best view and feature weights provided by the proposed algorithm in different parameter conditions. In Fig. 6(a) and (b), no matter using complete dataset or representatives, each view’s weight was very close in different parameter combinations. According to Fig. 6(c), each view’s weight varied in a large range when using representatives of water treatment dataset, but the relative importance of each view was still retained. As for feature weight distribution, no matter using complete dataset or representatives, the proposed algorithm provided extremely close weight distributions in most cases.

In summary, the representatives can be used for parameter selection because they can retain the main properties of the complete dataset. From above experiments, we also see that the proposed algorithm is not very sensitive to the α and β, except for some extreme situations such as 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0
                           
                         or(and) 
                           
                              β
                              =
                              0
                           
                        . So, we suggest there is no need to set very large α and β, such as 50 and 100.

                        . The five compared clustering algorithm are as follows.

                           
                              •
                              LAC: the locally adaptive clustering algorithm proposed in Domeniconi et al. (2007), where each feature in each cluster is assigned a weight.

EWKM: the entropy weighting k-means algorithm for subspace clustering of high-dimensional sparse data (Jing et al., 2007). Different from LAC, EWKM extends k-means algorithm with one additional step to compute feature weights for objects in each cluster.

WkMeans: the weighted k-means algorithm that assigns weight for each feature (Huang et al., 2005).

TWKM: an automated two-level variable weighting clustering algorithm for multi-view data, which can simultaneously compute weights for views and individual features (Chen et al., 2013).

MVKKM: the kernel-based weighted multi-view clustering algorithm, where views are expressed in term of given kernel matrices and a weighted combination of the kernels is learned in parallel to the partitioning (Tzortzis & Likas, 2012).

We ran each of the seven algorithms (except MVKKM) 30 times on each dataset. The MVKKM is a deterministic clustering method that only need run once on each dataset. Two standard clustering evaluation metrics were used to measure the algorithm performance, that is, Accuracy and Rand Index. For the two measures, the higher value indicates better clustering quality.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

Since the five algorithms are all weighted-based clustering algorithm and each has one or more parameters that used for weight distribution controlling, so we first ran the five algorithms and our method on the representatives of the three datasets to select the best parameters for each method. Table 2
                         shows the best parameter setting for each of the six algorithms on the three datasets. The clustering performance is shown in Table 3
                        , in which the bold numbers are better results. Table 3 also shows the results of t-test at the confidence level of 5% between the proposed algorithm and each of the other algorithms. Signs “+” or “
                           −
                        ” indicate that our method is significantly better or worse than the compared algorithm, respectively. Sign “≈ ” indicates that the difference is not statistically significant.

The comparison results measured by accuracy and rand index are reported in Table 3. A first glance at the comparison results in Table 3 shows that our method provided the highest average values on both indexes in the ALOI dataset, and the performance differences are statistically significant. It is also observed that TWKM and LAC achieved the best performance on MF and 3-Source dataset, respectively. However, from the paired t-test results, the differences between our method with TWKM and LAC are statistically insignificant on MF and 3-Sources dataset. In other words, the proposed method is as good as the TWKM and LAC on the two datasets. For 3-Sources dataset, while LAC and our method outperformed other algorithms, they both only reached about 42% and 47% on the accuracy and rand index, respectively. Actually, 3-Sources is the most difficult dataset among the three benchmarks, as its high dimension features up to 104. Moreover, Table 3 shows that the two bi-level multi-view clustering methods, TWKM and our method, are generally better than the three single-view clustering methods, i.e. LAC, EWKM and WkMeans, on ALOI and MF datasets, which validate the usefulness of bi-level weighting. In addition, if we compared TWKM and our method, our method is always better by a large margin in most cases. This observation validates the CPSC outperforms k-means, which is used in TWKM to update cluster centroids.

Besides the performance comparison, we examine the view weight learned by our method with some details, because the most important advantage of our method lies in its capability for simultaneous view and feature weighting. For example, for ALOI dataset we notice that the relative weights for RGB/HSB/similarity/Haralick are about 0.17/0.37/0.31/0.15, which clearly indicates that the HSB color histograms and color similarity are of the most importance when we clustering ALOI dataset. This observation perfectly agrees with our common sense on ALOI dataset, which consists of images that recorded under various light conditions and rotation angles. Moreover, this observation empirically justifies the correctness of the proposed view weighting method.

The runtime of the six algorithms are reported in Table 4
                        . Because all the six algorithms, except MVKKM, are dependent on the initial conditions, we repeat each experiment on each setting for 30 times and report the average run time. The results shows that TWKM is fastest on ALOI, LAC is fastest on MF and MVKKM is fastest on 3-Sources. Theoretically, time complexity of LAC, EWKM, WkMeans and TWKM are all O(rKND), if they need r iterations to converge. However, for our method, the time complexity is O(prKND), where p is the population size. Therefore, the runtime of our method agrees with our common sense that population-based optimization methods are slower than k-means style algorithms. Even through our method are slower than all compared algorithms except MVKKM on ALOI and MF, it do much better in clustering performances that demonstrated in Table 3.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this work, a hybrid optimization strategy based on PSO and gradient optimization method were proposed to solve multi-view clustering problems. The proposed method contains three iterative stages. In the first stage, a cooperative PSO algorithm is applied to update the cluster centroids given the view and feature weights. In the next two stages, the gradient optimization method is applied to update view and feature weight, given the cluster centroids. To determine the best fuzzy exponents for the proposed bi-level weighting method, a representative based parameter selection method is proposed and evaluated in this work. Compared to existing state-of-the-art weighted clustering algorithm, our method capture the importance of the view and weight simultane ously and achieve better performance in complicated real-world clustering tasks.

There are several relevant works to pursue in the future. First, although the optimization method applied in this work is effective for multi-view clustering, the efficiency should be improved to deal with large-scale dataset. Second, how to determine the best fuzzy exponents is another important issue. We need to remove them from the objective function or introduce more effective methods rather than running algorithm many times to determine them. Third, multi-view clustering is closely related to multi-task learning, some most recent work focus on applying regularization in multi-view clustering, which bring challenge for optimization. It is worth investigating how to design regularization term and optimize the induced loss function effectively. Finally, it would be also interesting to combine other clustering algorithm, such as spectral clustering, with bi-level weighting method to further improve its performance on multi-view data.
