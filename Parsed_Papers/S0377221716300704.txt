                  In technology-related industries, such as smartphones manufacturing, two phenomena can be observed for the products: the first is the obsolescence of an existing product, usually due to the appearance of a new product which decreases the attractiveness of the existing one; the second is the stochastic nature of the market demand and its price sensitivity. These two imply that the demand decreases over a product's lifecycle, and thus, the manufacturer and/or retailer may need to decline the retail price of the product during its lifecycle. In this paper, we assume that a dominant manufacturer wholesales a technological product to a retailer who has single or two buying opportunities. For either single- or two-buying-opportunity setting, we consider two models: (1) the retailer decreases the retail price at the product's midlife with no compensation from the manufacturer; (2) the manufacturer provides a rebate to the retailer for the retail price decline at the midlife. For the two-buying-opportunity setting, the rebate is that the manufacturer decreases the wholesale price at the midlife. The variables include the manufacturer's wholesale price and rebate, the retailer's order quantities and retail prices. We also compare the performance of the proposed models to the wholesale-price-only and the buyback policies.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Due to rapid innovation in technology-related industries, such as personal computers (PCs) and notebooks, these products are quickly outmoded. The introduction of a new product decreases the attractiveness of the existing ones; thus, customers prefer to purchase them at a discount or they opt to get the new product (Lee, Padmanabhan, Taylor, & Whang, 2000; Norton & Bass, 1987). Consequently, the products in technology-related industries have a short lifecycle, an uncertain demand and a decreasing price due to intensive competition (Lee et al., 2000; Chen & Xiao, 2011). The price of a PC decreases by 50–58 percent in average within the first year of its lifecycle (Lee et al., 2000; Chen & Xiao, 2011). Similarly, the average price of an Apple PCs drops as much as 20 percent in the first quarter (Philip, 2009; Chen & Xiao, 2011). It is also reported that in the second quarter of 2007 in China, the prices of notebooks and PCs, digital cameras, and mobile phones dropped monthly by 0.63 percent, 2.27 percent, and 7.05 percent, respectively (Chen & Xiao, 2011). Thus, retailers prefer to reduce their products’ stock levels due to demand uncertainty, and postpone ordering the products because of possible price decline in the future (Lee et al., 2000). Consequently, the manufacturers should employ approaches to induce the retailers to opt out these preferences.

There are studies, such as Lee et al. (2000), Taylor (2001), Sourirajan, Kapuscinski, and Ettl (2008), and Zhang (2008), that have modeled such problem where the product demand is uncertain and the retail price drops in the midlife due to the appearance of a new product. Extreme reduction in product price over the product's lifecycle makes the price protection a widely used policy that both manufacturers and retailers utilize in the PC industry. Two models are generally considered in the literature for the price protection policy. In the first model, the retailer has a single buying opportunity at the beginning of the product's lifecycle while the retail price decreases at the product's midlife. In this model, the manufacturer gives rebate to the retailer for unsold units by the time of the price decline. In the second model, the retailer has two buying opportunities: one at the beginning and the other at the product's midlife when the retail price, manufacturing cost and the wholesale price decline. In the model with a single buying opportunity, the manufacturer's rebate is a function of the retail price decline; while in the second model, it is a function of the wholesale price decline. To the best of our knowledge, the study of Lee et al. (2000) is the first which considered price protection policy in a dynamic model. They showed that if the price protection credit is chosen properly, it can coordinate the supply chain. Sourirajan et al. (2008) and Zhang (2008) also examined price-protection contracts for technological products in different situations.


                     Taylor (2001) considered three channel policies for two buying opportunities model: (1) price protection, (2) midlife return in which at the end of the first period, the manufacturer permits the retailer to either keep the unsold products and receive the price protection rebate or return some portion of the unsold products and receive the buyback rebate, and (3) end-of-life returns where the manufacturer allows the retailer to return unsold products at the end of the second period at some rebate. He proved that both coordination and a win-win outcome are guaranteed if these three policies are integrated, or the two return policies are combined and the retail price is constant over the product's lifecycle. In another study, Chen and Xiao (2011) studied the combination of these policies and demonstrated that under some conditions it may result in a win–win outcome.

Researchers also examined rebate policies where the manufacturer provides a credit to the retailer for each unit sold in the second period. Lu, Song, and Regan (2007) examined the price protection, rebate, midlife and end-of-life returns as well as their combinations for the single- and the two-buying-opportunity models. Linh and Hong (2009), Zhou and Wang (2012), Wang, Wang, and Min (2013a), Hematyar and Chaharsooghi (2014) and Zhang et al. (2014) have examined the performance of a revenue sharing contract on the supply chain coordination with the single and/or the two-buying-opportunity models.

The aforementioned studies assumed that the retail prices are determined exogenously. However, in some situations, especially when monopolies and oligopolies are common, the manufacturer and retailer consider the retail price as an endogenous decision variable to absorb the maximum profit earned from the market (Liu, 2005). The reason is that in such markets, manufacturers have the degree of freedom to determine their products’ prices in order to keep both demand and price high (Wilcox, 2002). For example, Dell, Compaq and HP occupy a great portion (52 percent) of the PC market in the United States (Gray, 2002). In addition, it was already discussed that when a new product is introduced to the market, some customers prefer to purchase the existing product at a discount. This indicates that the demand is highly price-sensitive. Considering both retail price and order quantity as decision variables has become a widely used approach in operations research studies (Liu, 2005; Chen, Pang, & Pan, 2014; Feng & Shi, 2012). These studies have assumed that the demand D( · ) is a function of retail price P in two different forms (Liu, 2005; Lau, Lau, & Wang, 2007): (1) linear form as 
                        
                           D
                           (
                           P
                           )
                           =
                           A
                           −
                           b
                           P
                        
                     , and (2) isoelastic form with constant elasticity as 
                        
                           D
                           
                              (
                              P
                              )
                           
                           =
                           K
                           
                           
                              P
                              
                                 −
                                 θ
                              
                           
                        
                     , where A, b, K and θ are given parameters. The randomness of price-sensitive demand is also modeled in two common forms (Liu, 2005; Lau et al., 2007):

                     Whitin (1955) considered a linear additive form for a price-sensitive demand. Dana and Petruzzi (2001) investigated a model in which the demand was price and inventory-level dependent. Zhao, Tang, Zhao, and Wei (2012) considered a wholesale-price-only contract for a two-echelon supply chain consisting of one retailer and two competitive manufacturers producing two substitutable products. In their model, the customers’ demand for each product is price-sensitive and is characterized as fuzzy variables. Huang, Yang, and Liu (2013) studied a pricing and production decision problem for a dual-channel supply chain, in which production costs are disrupted and demand is deterministic and price-sensitive. Lu and Liu (2013) studied a situation in which a supplier sells a product through a dual-channel distribution system, i.e., physical retailers and e-tailers. In their model, the demand was price and service-level sensitive. Lau, Su, Wang, and Hua (2012) examined the performance of volume discounting schemes in a supply chain, in which the market demand is sensitive to retail price and sales effort, and the manufacturer is dominant on the retailer.

For price-sensitive demand, Yao, Chen, and Yan (2004) showed that if the wholesale and the return (buyback) prices are a function of the retail price, channel coordination can be achieved. For a multi-retailer setting, Bernstein and Federgruen (2005) showed that coordination can be obtained using a price discount sharing policy, where the return price depends on the retail price. Lau et al. (2007) considered a dominant manufacturer newsvendor problem where the demand was price-sensitive and distributed uniformly. They examined the performance of the wholesale-price-only, buyback and manufacturer-imposed retail price policies on channel coordination. In the manufacturer-imposed retail price policy the manufacturer stipulates the retail price in addition to the wholesale and buyback prices. Lau, Lau, and Wang (2008) studied the performance of different contracts, such as buyback and revenue sharing, on a dominant retailer's profit.


                     Arcelus, Kumar, and Srinivasan (2012a) and Arcelus, Gor, and Srinivasan (2012b) considered a price-sensitive demand problem and investigated the effect of rebate policy on customers in different situations. Arcelus, Kumar, and Srinivasan (2012c) also assessed the pricing and ordering policies for a retailer under different degrees of risk tolerance. Weng (1997), Ha (2001), and Wang, Lau, and Lau (2012) considered two-part tariff policy for price-sensitive demand problems, in which the price of a product consists of an entry fee and a usage fee. Markup pricing is another policy which is used for price-sensitive demand problems (Wang, Wang, & Wang, 2013b; Wang, Lau, & Lau, 2013c; Wang, Wang, & Shou, 2013d). In this policy, a company first determines the actual cost of a product, and then, to define the product's retail price, adds a fixed percentage to it.

Some studies have considered the problem of pricing and inventory control decisions under supply uncertainty, such as Li and Zheng (2006), Chao, Chen, and Zheng (2008), Feng (2010), Feng and Shi (2012), Li, Sethi, and Zhang (2013a, 2013b), Chen, Feng, and Seshadri (2013), and Gong, Chao, and Zheng (2014). For more discussion in joint pricing and ordering decisions, we refer the readers to some other studies such as Chen and Simchi-Levi (2004), Adida and Ratisoontorn (2011), Wei, Zhao, and Li (2013), Chen, Fang, and Wen (2013), Xue, Demirag, and Niu (2014), Elmaghraby and Keskinocak (2003) and Chen and Simchi-Levi (2012).

However, the studies on price-sensitive demand have not considered the impact of a new product's appearance and/or the existing product's obsolescence on the existing product's price and demand. Generally, apart from uncertainty, demand for technological products can have the following characteristics:

                        
                           (1)
                           It decreases over the product's lifecycle due to the product obsolescence and/or the introduction of a new product.

It is price-sensitive, i.e. a higher price results in a lower demand. Therefore, retailers have to decrease the retail price of the existing products, particularly when a new product is introduced.

According to the literature, no study has simultaneously considered these two characteristics of the demand for technology-related products.

In this paper, we study a two-period supply chain problem in which a retailer purchases a technological product from a dominant manufacturer, and the product's demand has the two aforementioned characteristics. We assume that the retailer procures the product through two different settings: single-buying-opportunity and two-buying-opportunity. For each setting, we consider two models: in the first model, which is called the “two-price policy without rebate”, we assume it is the retailer's responsibility to decrease the retail price at a product's midlife without any compensation from the manufacturer; In the second model, which is called the “two-price policy with rebate”, we assume the manufacturer provides rebate to the retailer for any product sold after the decline of the retail price. For two-buying-opportunity setting, the rebate is that the manufacturer decreases the wholesale price at the midlife. We formulate the models to obtain the optimal decision variables which maximize the manufacturer and retailer's expected profits. The decision variables include the wholesale and the rebate prices which are set by the manufacturer, and the two retail prices and the order volumes which are set by the retailer. Moreover, we design the wholesale-price-only and the buyback policies for the problem discussed in this paper, and compare their performances with our proposed models from the perspective of manufacturer and retailer's profits.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the problem. In Section 3, we develop the two-price policy and benchmark models for the situation when the retailer has a single buying opportunity. In Section 4, we develop the models for the situation when the retailer has two buying opportunities. In Section 5, we conduct a numerical analysis to present the solutions to our proposed models and the benchmark policies, and to compare the performance of the policies. The concluding remarks and the future research are discussed in Section 6. The Sudoku algorithms for the two-price policy without and with rebate are presented in Appendix A and B. Appendix C presents a list of the notations used in the paper. Appendix D presents some tables and figures.

We consider a two-echelon supply chain model with a manufacturer wholesaling a technological product to a retailer. The product's lifecycle consists of T time-units, where each time-unit has a stochastic and price-sensitive demand, independent of the other time-units. Any time-unit can be considered such as an hour, a day, a week, or a month. Let Dt
                      denote the random demand per each time-unit, where

                      are the mean and the standard deviation of Dt
                     , respectively. The demand in our model is price-sensitive, but the price-sensitivity is constant before a certain time, such as when a new product is introduced, and increases afterward, i.e., when it approaches the product's end-of-life. This type of demand can be called a price-and-time sensitive demand.

For the price sensitivity of the demand, the linear demand-curve function is employed that indicates how

                      remains constant as P varies. An empirically estimated demand curve matches closer to an additive form compared to a multiplicative form (Lau et al., 2007), since many regression models assume that the standard deviations of the error terms are constant and are not dependent on the predictor variable. This means that an ‘additive’ form provides a closer fit to real situations (Lau et al., 2007), and is commonly used in the literature (Feng, 2010; Chen et al., 2014; Gong et al., 2014).

Thus, it may seem reasonable if the retailer decides to decrease (re-determines) the retail price during the product's lifecycle at tr
                      ∈ (tst
                     , T] to keep the demand as high as possible. Since there is a flexibility to reduce the retail price at time unit tr
                     , the model is considered as a two-period newsvendor problem. The first period is [1, tr

In this paper we consider two different situations. At the first situation, the retailer has single buying opportunity where he/she determines a single order Q and the first retail price P
                     1 at the beginning of Period 1, and determines the second retail price P
                     2 at the beginning of period 2. Once the retailer places the order Q, the manufacturer immediately provides it with the wholesale price
W dollar/unit. Each unit costs the manufacturer
Cm
                      dollar and, without loss of generality, it is assumed that Cm
                     
                     =1. Always, Cm
                      < W < P

                     , the model is called a two-price policy with rebate, otherwise it is called a two-price policy without rebate. In the second situation, the retailer has two buying opportunities in which he/she chooses the first order quantity Q
                     1 and retail price P
                     1 at the beginning of Period 1, and chooses the second order quantity Q
                     2 and retail price P
                     2 at the beginning of period 2. Subsequently, the manufacturer provides Q
                     1 with
W
                     1 dollar/unit and Q
                     2 with
W
                     2 dollar/unit. If the manufacturer decreases the wholesale price for the second order, the model is called a two-price policy with rebate (or discount), i.e., W
                     2 ≤ W
                     1. Otherwise, it is called a two-price policy without rebate, i.e.,

                     . Always, Cm
                      < W
                     2 ≤ W
                     1 < P
                     1 and W

sl
                      dollar/unit is incurred for the retailer if a customer's demand is not met through the product's lifecycle. At the end of the product's lifecycle, the retailer should also endure a holding cost of h dollar/unit for the unsold products.

The first three terms in Eq. (3.3) signify the expected revenue, the expected stock-out/shortage cost, and the expected holding cost at the first period, respectively. The fourth term represents the purchasing cost from the manufacturer, and the last term is the expected profit at period 2, if the leftover stock from the first period is positive with the value

From the literature, it is recognized that such problem cannot be solved analytically (Lau et al., 2007). Therefore, we develop a Sudoku algorithm, presented in Appendix A, for solving the problem.

For this model, it is assumed that the manufacturer pays 
                           
                              Δ

                         as a rebate to the retailer for each unit sold in period 2. Similarly, the model is a two-period newsvendor problem.

Under the manufacturer-Stackelberg game, the manufacturer first announces both the unit wholesale price W and the unit rebate Δ. Then, the retailer responds with the optimal unit retail price

To better investigate the performance of the two-price policy models in the single-buying-opportunity setting, we consider the wholesale-price-only and the buyback policy as well. In these two policies, we assume that the retailer does not reduce the retail price over the product's lifecycle; therefore, the problem is a single period model. Therefore, the random demand of the entire single period is denoted by D, whose finite ranges are

Generally, when a retailer determines only one retail price, the two-price policy is reduced to the wholesale-price-only policy. In the wholesale-price-only policy [W], under the manufacturer-Stackelberg game, a dominant manufacturer first announces a unit wholesale price W and then a retailer responds with the optimal unit retail price P* and the optimal order volume Q* to maximize her/his expected profit as:

The first three terms in Eq. (3.9) are the expected revenue, the expected stock-out/shortage cost, and the expected holding cost, respectively. The fourth term is the purchasing cost from the manufacturer.

Within a possible range for the wholesale price W, the manufacturer finds W* which maximizes his/her profit as:

When a manufacturer allows a retailer to return unsold products at the end of the product's lifecycle, the wholesale-price-only is converted to the buyback policy. In the buyback policy [W, R], the manufacturer simultaneously announces a unit buyback price R, and a unit wholesale price W. The retailer then responds with the optimal unit retail price P*, and the optimal order volume Q* which maximize the retailer's expected profit as:

The third term is the expected revenue, which is resulted due to returning the unsold products to the manufacturer at the end of the product's lifecycle. The first, the second, and the last terms are the same as those in Eq. (3.9).

Within a possible range for R and W, the manufacturer finds the optimal wholesale W* and buyback R* prices which maximize her/his expected profit as:

The first three terms in Eq. (4.1) signify the expected revenue, the expected shortage and holding costs, and the manufacturing cost at the first period. The last term is the expected profit from the second period. The three terms in Eq. (4.2) are the expected revenue, the expected shortage and holding costs, and the manufacturing cost at period 2. We know that an order-up-to policy is optimal for both Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2) (Lee et al., 2000; Feng & Shi, 2012). Let

Here, we again consider the wholesale-price-only and the buyback policies in order to evaluate the performance of the two-price policy models in the two-buying-opportunity setting. For the both polices, we assume that both the retailer and manufacturer do not reduce their prices in the second period. Since the retailer orders twice during the product life cycle, we still have a two-period problem. The finite range of the first period random demand D

                      follows a uniform distribution. In addition, we assume 
                        
                           α
                           =

                     , since the proposed models are going to be compared with the wholesale-price-only and buyback policies. In order to study the behavior of the two-price policy models in both the single- and two-buying opportunity settings, the models are solved for different combinations of parameters.

The numerical analysis section is divided into two subsections. In S
ection 5.1, we present the solutions for the four policies in the single- and two-buying opportunity settings. In S
ection 5.2, we compare the results. For the proposed two-price policy models of the single-buying-opportunity, the computations were performed on a GPC supercomputer at the SciNet HPC Consortium (Loken et al., 2010).
                  


                           Table 5.1 illustrates the optimal solutions for the two-price policy, when b
                           =0.5 and the manufacturer provides no rebate to the retailer who has a single-buying opportunity. We study the effect of different parameters on the optimal solution. In Table 5.1, the retailer and manufacturer's profits are obtained using Eqs. (3.3) and (3.5), respectively.

For all cases in Table 5.1, we obtained the channel efficiency to be less than 1, indicating that the channel is not coordinated. This phenomenon has been also observed in the earlier studies for a price-sensitive demand (e.g. Lau et al., 2007). Furthermore, since the manufacturer leads the retailer, one can see that πM
                            > π
                           
                              Re1, where 1.72 < πM
                           /π
                           
                              Re1 < 2. It can be also seen that when β increases, the two retail prices, P
                           1 and P
                           2, and the wholesale price W decrease. The interpretation is when the demand is more sensitive to the price, the retailer is not able to keep the retail price high. The manufacturer also needs to decrease the wholesale price to support the retailer for the retail price decline. In addition, when β increases, the optimal order volume decreases because the demand decreases. All these effects cause the expected profits of both parties to decrease since the retailer will face with a higher drop in the demand due to the increase of β. The comparison of the first two cases shows when σ
                           ɛ increases, the two parties decrease their prices, since they face with a higher risk, which results in a decreased expected profits for both the manufacturer and the retailer.

By comparing the results of Case 1 and Case 3, it can be concluded when the goodwill cost increases, the retailer needs to increase the inventory level, so he/she can avoid the risk of stock-out. This means that the manufacturer can sell more products, and thus, the manufacturer's profit grows while the retailer's expected profit decreases. The results presented in Case 4 indicate when the holding cost grows, the retailer has to decrease the inventory level. Therefore, unlike Case 3, both parties lose their expected profits compared to Case 1.


                           Table 5.2
                            illustrates the optimal solutions for the two-price policy, when b
                           =0.5 and the retailer has two buying opportunities. In Table 5.2, the retailer and manufacturer's profits are obtained using Eqs. (4.3) and (4.5), respectively.

Similar interpretation of Table 5.1 applies for Table 5.2. For example, when β increases, 
                              
                                 
                                    Q
                                    1
                                 
                                 +
                                 
                                    Q
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           , W, P
                           1 and P
                           2 decrease. Comparison of Tables 5.1 and 5.2 ends up with the following insights. When the retailer has two buying opportunities during the product life cycle, the manufacturer sets lower wholesale price so that the retailer can fix lower retail prices as well. As a result of this, in the two-buying-opportunity setting, the manufacturer obtains less and the retailer obtains more than the single-buying-opportunity setting, i.e., ΠM
                            < πM
                            and Π
                           
                              Re1 > π
                           
                              Re1. In appendix, as shown in Tables A1 and A2, we also study the effect of different parameters on the optimal solutions when b
                           =1.0. We observe the same result as when b
                           =0.5. In addition, one can also see that similarly to β, b causes the wholesale price, retail prices, order quantity, and manufacturer and retailer's profit to decrease.

Figs. A1–A3 in appendix are depicted based on the first row of Case 1 in Table 5.1 (single-buying-opportunity setting). In Fig. A1, we gradually increase the wholesale price and observe its effect on the manufacturer and retailer's expected profits. It illustrates that the manufacturer's profit is concave, and the retailer's expected profit decreases with respect to W. The reason is that as the wholesale price increases the retailer's order volume decreases. This order volume reduction does not impact negatively on the manufacturer's profit up to W*, but both the order volume decrease and wholesale price increase result in retailer's profit to decrease. Fig. A2 shows how the three decision variables, P
                           1, P
                           2, Q, change as W increases steadily. P
                           1 and P
                           2 are increasing and Q is decreasing in W. Another point that one can get from Fig. A2 is P
                           1 and P
                           2 move in parallel. Fig. A3 shows the effect of P
                           1 on the manufacturer and retailer's expected profits. Fig. A3 depicts that the manufacturer's profit is decreasing and the retailer's expected profit is concave as P
                           1 gradually increases and W is kept in its optimal value, i.e., 9.53. The interpretation is when P
                           1 increases, the market demand and the retailer's order volume decrease, and consequently, the manufacturer's profit decreases. However, the effect of the market demand reduction on the retailer's expected profit is negligible up to 
                              
                                 P
                                 1
                                 *
                              
                           . The same conclusion can be made for the two-buying-opportunity setting that we do not present here since it is duplicate.

As discussed, in the single buying opportunity, the manufacturer pays the retail price decline, i.e., 
                              
                                 Δ
                                 =
                                 
                                    P
                                    1
                                 
                                 −
                                 
                                    P
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           , to the retailer at the second period. In the two buying opportunities, the manufacturer reduces the wholesale price at the second period (
                              
                                 Δ
                                 =
                                 
                                    W
                                    1
                                 
                                 −
                                 
                                    W
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           ) for compensating the retailer's retail price decline. Table 5.3
                            shows the optimal solutions for the two-price policy, when b
                           =0.5 and the retailer has a single buying opportunity. In order to evaluate the performance of this policy in a single buying opportunity, we consider different combinations of parameters. In Table 5.3, the retailer and manufacturer's profits are obtained using Eqs. (3.6) and (3.8), respectively.

Similar to the previous cases, for all the cases in Table 5.3 when there is only single buying opportunity, channel efficiency was obtained to be less than 1, indicating that the channel is not coordinated. πM
                           /π
                           
                              Re1 > 2 shows that the manufacturer obtains twice more profit than the retailer. In addition, as β increases, the manufacturer pays a higher rebate that makes him/her able to set a higher wholesale price. Except Δ and W, one can see that the retail prices, the order quantity, and the expected profits decrease in β. The effect of σ
                           ɛ, h and sl
                            are the same as those presented for the two-price policy without rebate.

                           =0.5 and the retailer has two buying opportunities. In Table 5.4, the retailer and manufacturer's profits are obtained using Eqs. (4.6) and (4.8), respectively.


                           Table 5.4 follows similar interpretation of Table 5.3. Comparison of Tables 5.3 and 5.4 shows when the retailer has two buying opportunities, the manufacturer obtains less and the retailer obtains more than the single buying opportunity, i.e., ΠM
                            < πM

                              Re1 > π
                           
                              Re1. Again it is proved that the two-buying-opportunity setting is more profitable for the retailer than the single-buying-opportunity setting. In appendix, as shown in Tables A3 and A4, we study the effect of different parameters on the optimal solutions when b
                           =1.0. We observe the same result as when b
                           =0.5. In addition, one can also see that similarly to β, b causes the wholesale price, retail prices, order quantity, and manufacturer and retailer's profit to decrease.

Figs. A4–A6 in appendix are depicted based on the first row of Case 1 in Table 5.3 (single-buying-opportunity setting with rebate). Similar to Figs. A1 and A4 illustrates that the manufacturer's expected profit is concave, and the retailer's expected profit is decreasing with respect to W. Fig. A5 presents the effect of the wholesale price on P
                           1, P
                           2, Δ and Q. It can be seen when the manufacturer increases the wholesale price, he/she should pay a higher Δ. The retailer also responses to the increase of the wholesale price with a higher retail price P
                           1. The point is that P
                           1 and Δ increase in parallel. Therefore, P
                           2 remains approximately constant. In Fig. A6, W is kept in its optimal value, i.e., 10.42, but Δ is steadily increased to see its effect on the manufacturer and the retailer's expected profits. Now, one can see that the manufacturer's expected profit is concave and the retailer's expected profit is increasing with respect to Δ. The reason is when Δ increases and W is kept fixed, the retailer's order volume increases, therefore, the manufacturer's profit increases up to Δ*. However, for the values greater than Δ*, the incurred cost by offering rebate outweighs the sales revenue. Therefore, the manufacturer's profit reduces. Moreover, it is intuitive that the retailer's expected profit increases as Δ goes up. The same conclusion is made for the two-buying-opportunity setting, which we do not present it here since it is duplicate.

Here, we only consider Case 1 for the analysis, since it has been already demonstrated that the other cases do not provide any additional insights. Table 5.5 presents the solutions for the wholesale-price-only policy with different values for β when the retailer has only one buying opportunity. In Table 5.5, the manufacturer and retailer's profits are obtained using Eqs. (3.9) and (3.10), respectively.

For this policy, the channel efficiencies were again obtained to be less than one, which shows the channel is not coordinated. Similar to the previous policies, β has a negative impact on all the decision variables as well as the expected profits. Also, πM
                           /πRe
                            < 2.


                           Table 5.6 illustrates the optimal solutions when the retailer has two buying opportunities. In Table 5.6, the retailer and manufacturer's profits are obtained using Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10), respectively.

By comparing Tables 5.5 and 5.6, we can see that, despite other cases or contracts, in the wholesale-price-only contract, the manufacture is better off when the retailer has two buying opportunities.


                           Table 5.7 shows the solutions for the buyback policy when the retailer has single buying opportunity. In Table 5.7, the manufacturer and the retailer's expected profits are obtained using Eqs. (3.11) and (3.12), respectively.
                        

In the buyback policy, the channel is not coordinated, since channel efficiencies were less than 1 for the three examples in Table 5.7. Here, it is perceived that a higher β results in a lower buyback price. This can be interpreted as when β increases, order volume decreases, and therefore, the manufacturer can offer a lower buyback price. Also, πM
                           /πRe
                            > 2.


                           Table 5.8 illustrates the optimal solutions for two-buying-opportunity setting. In Table 5.8, the retailer and manufacturer's profits are obtained using Eqs. (4.12) and (4.14), respectively.

Comparison of Tables 5.8 and 5.7 shows that when the retailer has two buying opportunities, the manufacturer obtains less and the retailer obtains more than the single-buying-opportunity setting.

In this paper, we have evaluated the performance of four policies or contracts when (1) the retailer has single buying opportunity, and (2) the retailer has two buying opportunities. The four policies were the buyback policy [W, R], wholesale-price-only policy [W], two-price policy with rebate [P
                        1, P
                        2, Δ], and two-price policy without rebate [P
                        1, P
                        2]. Now, we perform a comparative analysis of each pair of the contracts:

                           
                              •
                              The [P
                                 1, P
                                 2, Δ] and [P
                                 1, P
                                 2]

For both the single- and two-buying-opportunity settings, the manufacturer gains more and the retailer gains less in [P
                                 1, P
                                 2, Δ]. It is interesting to see that the [P
                                 1, P
                                 2, Δ] policy results in a higher expected profit to the manufacturer than the [P
                                 1, P
                                 2] policy. This is a counter-intuitive phenomenon since one can expect when the manufacturer compensates the retail price decline, he/she should obtain less. However, in the [P
                                 1, P
                                 2, Δ] policy, the manufacturer has the power of setting two manipulating tools, the wholesale price W and the rebate Δ, to increase his/her expected profit.

The [P
                                 1, P
                                 2, Δ] and the [W, R]

For both the single- and two-buying-opportunity settings, both the manufacturer and retailer obtain more in [P
                                 1, P
                                 2, Δ]. The reason is when the retailer reduces the retail price during the product lifecycle, he/she can attract more customers that profits both parties.

The [P
                                 1, P
                                 2] and the [W, R]

For both the single- and two-buying-opportunity settings, the manufacturer earns more in [W, R], while the retailer is better off in [P
                                 1, P
                                 2]. Similar to the [P
                                 1, P
                                 2, Δ] policy, the manufacturer takes the advantage of setting two manipulating tools, W and R, in [W,R]. Therefore, his/her expected profit is greater than its counterpart in the [P
                                 1, P
                                 2].

The [W, R] and the [W]

For both settings, the manufacturer is better off in [W, R], while the retailer gets more in [W]. The logic behind this phenomenon is that the manufacturer offers R to increase her/his own profit only.

The [P
                                 1, P
                                 2, Δ] and the [W]

The manufacturer earns more in [P
                                 1, P
                                 2, Δ] for both the single- and two-buying-opportunity settings. The retailer also obtains more in [P
                                 1, P
                                 2, Δ] when he/she has two buying opportunities. However, when the retailer has only one buying opportunity, he/she is better off in [W].

The [P
                                 1, P
                                 2] and the [W]

The [P
                                 1, P
                                 2] policy is more profitable for the retailer in both single- and two-buying-opportunity settings. The manufacturer is worse off in the [P
                                 1, P
                                 2] policy when the retailer has two buying opportunities. However, when the retailer has only one buying opportunity, the manufacturer is better off in [P
                                 1, P
                                 2] compared to [W].

At the end, by this numerical analysis we can conclude that the manufacturer is always better off if he/she pays Δ or R to the retailer. However, the [P
                        1, P
                        2, Δ] policy is more interesting for the manufacturer in comparison with the [W, R] policy. In addition, the retailer is better off if he/she declines the retail price over the product life cycle without any compensation from the manufacturer. i.e., the [P
                        1, P
                        2] policy is the most beneficial policy for the retailer, because he/she uses this price decline to increase his/her own expected profit.

This paper considers a two-echelon supply chain (newsvendor) models consisting of a dominant manufacture and a follower retailer. The manufacturer wholesales to the retailer a technological product, such as personal computers or notebooks, for which the product's demand is stochastic and price-sensitive. This price sensitivity may increase over the product's lifecycle, indicating that the demand decreases over this period due to the product obsolescence and/or the appearance of a new product. Therefore, the retailer needs to decrease the retail price in the midlife of the product to keep the demand as high as possible.

We considered two situations: (1) the retailer has two buying opportunities, once at the beginning and another at the middle of the product's lifecycle; and (2) he/she has only single buying opportunity at the beginning of the product's lifecycle. For both situations, we proposed a new policy which enables the manufacturer and the retailer to set the retail price twice during the product's lifecycle. In the single-buying-opportunity setting, the retailer places the order of Q units to the manufacturer and sets the retail price P
                     1 at the beginning of the product's lifecycle, and sets P
                     2 at the product's midlife so that 
                        
                           
                              P
                              1
                           
                           −
                           
                              P
                              2
                           
                           ≥
                           0
                        
                     . In the two-buying-opportunity setting, the retailer sets Q
                     1 and P
                     1 at the beginning of the product's lifecycle, and sets Q
                     2 and P
                     2 at the product's midlife. For both settings, two different models were developed. In the first one, which is called the two-price policy without rebate [P
                     1, P
                     2], it is assumed that the retailer is committed to decrease the retail price without any compensation from the manufacturer. In the second model, the manufacturer provides rebate to the retailer for the retail price decline: in single-buying-opportunity setting, the manufacturer pays 
                        
                           Δ
                           =
                           
                              P
                              1
                           
                           −
                           
                              P
                              2
                           
                        
                      for the products sold after the decline of the retail price; and in two-buying-opportunity setting, the manufacturer decreases the wholesale price at the product's midlife, i.e., he/she discounts 
                        
                           Δ
                           =
                           
                              W
                              1
                           
                           −
                           
                              W
                              2
                           
                        
                     . Hence, we called this policy the two-price policy with rebate [P
                     1, P
                     2, Δ]. To investigate the performance of these two proposed policies, the wholesale-price-only [W] and the buyback [W, R] policies were also considered. The numerical analysis demonstrated that: (a) although the manufacturer pays Δ and R in [P
                     1, P
                     2, Δ] and [W, R] policies, respectively, these two policies provide the manufacturer a higher expected profit than [P
                     1, P
                     2] and [W] policies; (c) the [P
                     1, P
                     2, Δ] policy is more beneficial for the manufacturer in comparison with the [W, R] policy; (b) although under the [P
                     1, P
                     2] policy the retailer is solely committed for the retail price decline, the retailer obtains the most benefit. Therefore, the [P
                     1, P
                     2] policy may interest the retailer the most, while the [W, R] and [P
                     1, P
                     2, Δ] may be more appealing to the manufacturer.

It can be seen that the results of [W, R] and [W] policies are in agreement with the literature (see Lau et al., 2007), which verifies the accuracy of our results for [W, R] and [W] policies. Therefore, one may be able to trust the accuracy of the results for the [P
                     1, P
                     2] and [P
                     1, P
                     2, Δ] policies as well. However, it is suggested that the supply chain managers carefully model their problems and analyze the solutions for making an appropriate pricing decision.

We compared our proposed models with the wholesale-price-only and the buyback policies to show their advantages and disadvantages from both manufacturer and retailer's perspectives in a supply chain. We suggest that the future studies consider the performance of other policies, such as two-part tariffs, revenue sharing, and etcetera, as well as their combinations, from the perspectives of supply chain's parties.
