                  We define a general game which forms a basis for modelling situations of static search and concealment over regions with spatial structure. The game involves two players, the searching player and the concealing player, and is played over a metric space. Each player simultaneously chooses to deploy at a point in the space; the searching player receiving a payoff of 1 if his opponent lies within a predetermined radius r of his position, the concealing player receiving a payoff of 1 otherwise. The concepts of dominance and equivalence of strategies are examined in the context of this game, before focusing on the more specific case of the game played over a graph. Methods are presented to simplify the analysis of such games, both by means of the iterated elimination of dominated strategies and through consideration of automorphisms of the graph. Lower and upper bounds on the value of the game are presented and optimal mixed strategies are calculated for games played over a particular family of graphs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper, we define a general search and concealment game that takes full account of the spatial structure of the set over which it is played. The game is static in the sense that players do not move, but deploy simultaneously at particular spatial points and receive payoffs based on their relative positions. In this way, the static spatial search game (SSSG) provides a theoretical foundation for the study of the relative strategic value of different positions in a geography. Using the theory of metric spaces, we model situations in which the searching player may simultaneously search multiple locations based on concepts of distance or adjacency relative to the point at which they are deployed.

While the SSSG does build upon previous work, particularly that of Ruckle (1983) and White (1994), its simplicity and generality together with its explicit consideration of spatial structure set it apart from much of the literature (see Section 3 for a detailed review of related work) and lend it the versatility to describe games over a huge variety of different spaces. The primary contributions of this article are therefore to both propose a highly general model of spatial search and concealment situations, which unites several other games presented in the literature (see Section 4.2), and to present new propositions and approaches for the strategic analysis of such scenarios.

While this paper is theoretical in nature, the SSSG provides a framework for the analysis of a diverse range of operational research questions. Aside from explicit search and concealment scenarios, the game may be used to model situations in which some structure or region must be protected against ‘attacks’ that could arise at any spatial point; for example, the deployment of security personnel to protect cities against terrorist attacks or outbreaks of rioting, security software scanning computer networks to eliminate threats, the defence of shipping lanes against piracy, the protection of a rail network against cable theft or the deployment of stewards at public events to respond to emergency situations.

We provide a brief overview of all necessary game theoretic concepts in Section 2 and a review of the literature on games of search and security in Section 3, before formally defining the SSSG, examining its relationship to other games in the literature and presenting some initial propositions in Section 4. In Section 5, we examine the SSSG on a graph and identify upper and lower bounds on the value of such games before presenting an algorithm in Section 6 which simplifies graph games by means of the iterated elimination of dominated strategies, focusing particularly on the application of the algorithm to games played on trees. Section 7 contains further results, including a way to simplify graph games through consideration of graph automorphisms and an examination of a particular type of strategy for such games, which we describe as an “equal oddments strategy”. In Section 8, we use the concept of an equal oddments strategy to find analytic solutions for a particular family of graph games, while Section 9 forms a conclusion to the paper, containing a summary of our key results and suggestions of potential avenues for further research. Two proofs, which were too complicated to include in the main text, are presented as appendices.

Since the designation of the players as A and B is arbitrary, obtaining corresponding definitions of strategic dominance and equivalence for Player B is simply a matter of relabelling.

Note that weak dominance, strict dominance and equivalence are all special cases of very weak dominance. Also, strict dominance is a special case of weak dominance.

In this paper, weak dominance is of most relevance. Therefore, for reasons of clarity, the terms “dominance” and “dominated strategies” will be used to refer to weak dominance unless otherwise stated.

Since a player aims to maximise his or her payoff, we would intuitively expect that they should not play any dominated strategies.

For a general definition of dominance in game theory, see Leyton-Brown and Shoham (2008, pp. 20–23), from which the above definition was adapted.

Games of search and concealment, in which one player attempts to hide themselves or to conceal some substance in a specified space while another player attempts to locate or capture the player or substance, have been widely studied.

One of the simplest search games is the well-known high-low number guessing game in which one player chooses an integer in a given range, while the other player makes a sequence of guesses to identify it, each time being informed whether the guess was too high or too low (Gal, 1974). Continuous versions of the game have also been studied (Gal, 1978; Baston et al., 1985; Alpern, 1985a).

Another simple search game involves one player attempting to locate an object that the opposing player has hidden at a location chosen from a finite or countably infinite set with no spatial structure (except a possible ordering). Variants of these games include examples where the searching player has some chance of overlooking the object despite searching the correct location (Neuts, 1963; Subelman, 1981) or where the searcher must also avoid the location of a second hidden object (Ruckle, 1990).

A more complicated class of search games is that in which the searching player is mobile and their target is immobile, with payoffs to each player typically (though not universally) being dependent on the amount of time that elapses before the target is located. Such games have been examined over many different types of graph (Anderson et al., 1990; Alpern, 2008, 2010; Buyang, 1995; Reijnierse & Potters, 1993; Kikuta et al., 1994; Kikuta, 2004; Pavlović, 1995), though in general the space may be a continuous region (Gal, 1979). While the starting position of the searching player is often fixed, games in which the searching player can choose their position have also been studied (Alpern, Baston, & Gal, 2008a; Dagan et al., 2008), as have games with multiple searchers (Alpern & Howard, 2000; Peshkin, 1994).

Accumulation games are an extension of this concept in which there may be many hidden objects (Kikuta et al., 1997) or in which hidden objects are replaced with some continuous material that the hiding player can distribute across a set of discrete locations (Kikuta et al., 2002; Zoroa, Fernández-Sáez, & Zoroa, 2004) or across a continuous space (Ruckle et al., 2000). The payoffs in these games are typically dependent on the number of objects or the quantity of material that the searching player is able to locate.

Adding a further layer of complication, there is the class of search game in which both the searching player and the hiding player are mobile, including so-called “princess and monster” games. Again, the payoffs in such games are typically dependent on the amount of time that elapses before the hiding player is captured and players are typically ‘invisible’ to each other, only becoming aware of the location of their opponent at the moment of capture.

Such games have been considered over continuous one-dimensional spaces such as the circle (Alpern, 1974) and the unit interval (Alpern, Fokkink, Lindelauf, & Olsder, 2008b), over continuous graphs or networks (Alpern et al., 1986; Anderson et al., 1992; Alpern, 1985b) and over continuous two-dimensional spaces (Foreman, 1977; Garnaev, 1991; Chkhartishvili et al., 1995). In the latter case, it is necessary to introduce the concept of a detection radius, with a capture occurring if the distance between the players drops below this value. In some cases, the probability of capture is allowed to vary based on the distance between the players (Garnaev, 1992).

Analyses of search games over discrete spaces in which both searcher and hider are mobile have tended to consider spatial structure in only a very limited way. While this structure may determine the freedom of movement of the players, very little work has been done to introduce an analogous concept to the detection radius to such games. Generally, players move sequentially and may only move to locations that are sufficiently close to their current position (e.g. Eagle et al., 1991), though variants have been considered in which either the searching player (Zoroa, Fernández-Sáez, & Zoroa, 2012) or the hiding player (Thomas et al., 1991) has the freedom to move to any location regardless of adjacency or distance.

Further variations on the search game with mobile searcher and hider include games in which the searching player follows a pre-determined path and must decide how thoroughly to search each location visited (Hohzaki et al., 2000), games in which the searching player must intercept an opponent attempting to move from a given start point to a given end point (Alpern, 1992) and games with a variegated environment and the possibility that the hiding player will be betrayed by ‘citizens’ of the space (Owen et al., 2008). Such games have also been used to model predator–prey interactions (Alpern, Fokkink, Timmer, & Casas, 2011a).

Allocation games are a related concept, in which the searching player does not move around the space individually, but rather distributes ‘search resources’ to locate the mobile hiding player. Such games may include false information (Hohzaki, 2007) and may incorporate spatial structure by allowing the influence of resources to spread across space (“reachability”), an area which has seen “little research” (Hohzaki, 2008).

Variations on this idea include situations in which searching resources are deployed sequentially (Dendris, Kirousis, & Thilikos, 1997) or in which both players distribute resources to respectively locate or protect a hidden object (Baston et al., 2000). Cooperative allocation games, in which multiple players combine their searching resources to locate a moving target, have also been considered (Hohzaki, 2009).

Rendez-vous games are a parallel concept to games with mobile searching and hiding players, the difference being that these games are cooperative, with both players wishing to locate the other as soon as possible (see Alpern, 2002, for an overview). Typically, in a rendez-vous game, the structure of the space is known to all, with consideration given to the amount of information available to players regarding their relative positions, and their ability to distinguish between symmetries of the space (whether they have a common understanding of “North”, for example).

Rendez-vous games have been studied over various continuous one-dimensional spaces, such as the line (Alpern et al., 1995; Lim et al., 1996; Alpern et al., 2000) and the circle (Alpern, 2000), over continuous two-dimensional spaces, such as the plane (Kikuta et al., 2010) or a general compact metric space (Alpern, 1995) and over discrete spaces, such as lattices (Alpern et al., 2005; Ruckle, 2007) and other graphs (Alpern, Baston, & Essegaier, 1999). Costs may also be introduced for movement and examination of particular locations (Kikuta et al., 2007).

Work has also been done on ‘hybrid’ games of search and rendez-vous, where, for example, two agents attempt to meet without being located by a third (Alpern et al., 1998) or where the seaching player does not know whether the other player is attempting to rendez-vous or to evade capture (Alpern et al., 2002).

Security games are used to model situations in which some public resource (e.g. airports, transport infrastructure, power facilities) must be protected from attack with limited defensive resources. A good introduction to the topic is provided by Tambe (2012).

Such situations tend to be modelled as Stackelberg games, where it is assumed that the defensive player first commits to some strategy to protect the vulnerable sites and that this strategy is observed by the attacking player, who then chooses an optimal response (Tambe, 2012, pp. 4–8). Stackelberg-type security games related to the mobile-searcher-immobile-hider games of Section 3.2 have also been proposed to examine optimal patrolling strategies (Alpern, Morton, & Papadaki, 2011b; Basilico, Gatti, & Amigoni, 2012).

A related concept is that of the much studied Colonel Blotto game, in which two players must simultaneously distribute a fixed quantity of discrete or continuous resources across a number of sites, each site being ‘won’ by the player who distributed the greater quantity of resources to it, with payoffs determined by the number of sites that each player wins (see Roberson, 2006). The many extensions of the Blotto game have included asymmetric versions (Tofias, Merolla, & Munger, 2007; Hortala-Vallve & Llorente-Saguer, 2012), examples in which resources are allocated to battlefields sequentially rather than simultaneously (Powell, 2009) and examples in which defensive resources are heterogenous (Cohen, 1966).

Though the deployment sites in such models are often assumed to be wholly separate, with events at one location having no effect on events at other locations, certain security games and Blotto games with strategically interdependent sites have been considered. For example, Shubik and Weber (1981) introduce the concept of a “characteristic function” for such games, which allocates values to subsets of the sites, thus allowing interdependencies between them to be captured. Other approaches to modelling such interdependence include an extension of the Colonel Blotto game in which a successful attack on a “radar site” ensures the success of attacks on other sites (Grometstein & Shoham, 1989), while Hausken (2010, 2011) discusses a classification of the underlying infrastructures of security games based on the interdependence of their sites (e.g. series, parallel, complex, …) and Powell (2007) analyses the relative value of defending borders over protecting strategic targets directly.

Though analyses of interdependence in security games and Blotto games may be quite general (that of Shubik & Weber, 1981, for example), interdependence that arises explicitly from the spatial structure of the deployment sites has not been considered in a general setting.

One of the most general and theoretical analyses of search and concealment type situations is Geometric games and their applications (Ruckle, 1983). In this book, the author defines a geometric game as a two-player zero-sum game (with players called “RED” and “BLUE”) played over a given set S, where the strategy sets for each player 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Σ
                                 
                                 
                                    RED
                                 
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 
                                    Σ
                                 
                                 
                                    BLUE
                                 
                              
                           
                         are subsets of the power set 
                           
                              P
                              (
                              S
                              )
                           
                         (the set of all subsets of S). Pure strategies for each player are therefore subsets 
                           
                              R
                              ,
                              B
                              ⊆
                              S
                           
                        . The payoff to each player is a function of R and B, typically depending directly on the intersection 
                           
                              R
                              ∩
                              B
                           
                        .

This concept of a geometric game allows Ruckle to model a wide variety of situations of search, ambush and pursuit, as well as a range of abstract games, taking full consideration of the structure of the space S over which the games are played.

Most published work based on Ruckle’s ideas (e.g. Baston, Bostock, & Ferguson, 1989; Zoroa et al., 1993; Zoroa, Fernández-Sáez, & Zoroa, 1999; Zoroa, Zoroa, & Fernández-Sáez, 1999, 2001, 2003; Alpern, Baston, & Gal, 2009, 2010) has focused on specific examples of geometric games, rather than on general results.

Much of the literature on search games and related concepts has focussed on analysing specific games, rather than attempting to present general frameworks for such situations and identifying more broadly applicable results. While spatial structure may be considered for games in which players are mobile, the geography of the space over which games are played is often given little or limited consideration, particularly in the literature on security games. The concept of “reachability”, as described by Hohzaki (2008), in which a searcher or searching resource deployed at a point has influence over a neighbourhood of that point, has received very little attention. Games which concentrate purely on the strategic value of a player’s chosen position in a space, rather than on strategies for moving through the space for the purposes of search or rendez-vous, have also seen little research, at least since the work of Ruckle (1983).

The definitions and notation relating to metric spaces used in this section are from Sutherland (1975, pp. 19–44).

                         may be the Euclidean distance, while in a graph d may be the length of the shortest path connecting two points. However, depending on the interpretation of the game, d could also represent an abstract distance, indicating dissimilarity, difficulty of communication or perceived costs.

In specific cases, it may be sensible to relax some of these conditions. For example, in a graph that is not connected, we could allow infinite distances between vertices that are not connected by a path (an extended metric). Alternatively, to represent a directed graph, we may wish to ignore the symmetry condition (M2) (a quasi-metric; see Steen & Seebach (1970)). However, for the sake of simplicity, we do not consider such cases at this time.

This is a constant-sum game and can be analysed accordingly.

In interpreting the game, we imagine that Player B chooses to hide somewhere in Ω, while Player A attempts to locate his opponent. To do this, Player A selects a point of Ω and searches a neighbourhood of this point. If Player B’s hiding place falls within the detection radius of Player A’s chosen point, the attempt to hide is unsuccessful and Player B is located. Otherwise, Player B remains undetected.

The game is illustrated in Fig. 1
                        .

The SSSG is not strictly a geometric game by Ruckle’s definition (1983, p. 2), since it is not zero-sum. However, it could be transformed into a zero-sum game without altering the subsequent analysis, simply by subtracting 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         from all payoffs. The decision that all payoffs should be 0 or 1 has been taken to ensure the clarity of the payoff matrices considered later in this paper.

Given this proviso, certain of Ruckle (1983)’s geometric games can be formulated as particular cases of the SSSG. For example, if transformed to a zero-sum game as described, game AAGV (Ruckle, 1983, p. 86; adapted from Arnold (1962)) is an example of the SSSG, with

Similarly, White (1994)’s Games of strategy on trees are examples of the SSSG, where Ω is the set of vertices of a tree,

                         and d is the length of the shortest path between two vertices.

A game that demonstrates the potential complexity that can arise from apparently simple cases of the SSSG is the “Cookie-Cutter” game (or the “Hiding in a Disc” game), in which Player A chooses a point in a disc of unit radius and Player B simultaneously places a circular ‘cookie-cutter’ centred at any point of the disc, winning the game if Player A’s point lies within the ‘cookie-cutter’. Given appropriate payoffs, this game is an example of the SSSG, where Ω is the closed unit disc,

The particular case of this game with

                         was originally proposed by Gale et al. (1974), for which optimal mixed strategies were presented by Evans (1975). The game was extended to all 
                           
                              r

                         by Bordelon (1975), who proposed optimal mixed strategies for all 
                           
                              r

                        , but these results were disputed by Ruckle (1983, p. 108). Ruckle’s disproof was disputed in turn by Danskin (1990), who showed that Bordelon (1975)’s results were correct for some values of 
                           
                              r

                        , though false in general. Despite the apparent simplicity of the problem, Danskin (1990) was only able to find optimal mixed strategies for a small range of values of r around 
                           
                              r

                         and for all 
                           
                              r

                        , thus illustrating the hidden complexity of many games of this form.

A particularly simple example of a game that can be represented as an SSSG is “Matching Pennies” (see Blackwell & Girshick, 1954, p. 13), in which Players A and B simultaneously call “Heads” or “Tails”, with Player A receiving a payoff of 1 if the calls are the same and −1 otherwise, and Player B receiving a payoff of −1 if the calls are the same and 1 otherwise.

                              =

                              =

                              Tails

                        , with d as any valid metric, this is an SSSG, again with the proviso that the payoffs must be transformed appropriately.

A more complicated example of a game that can be represented as an SSSG is the graph security game of Mavronicolas, Papadopoulou, Philippou, and Spirakis (2008) if the number of attackers is restricted to one. This game is played over an undirected graph 
                           
                              G
                              =
                              (
                              V
                              (
                              G
                              )
                              ,
                              E
                              (
                              G
                              )
                              )
                           
                         with one defender and (in general) multiple attackers. Simultaneously, the defender chooses an edge and the attackers each choose a vertex. The defender receives a payoff equal to the number of attackers who choose vertices incident to his chosen edge. Each attacker receives a payoff equal to 0 if their chosen vertex is incident to the defender’s edge and 1 otherwise.

Consider the graph 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    G
                                 
                                 
                                    ′
                                 
                              
                           
                         obtained by inserting a new vertex at the midpoint of each of the edges of G. Let the set of new vertices created in this way be denoted

                        , this game is also an example of the SSSG.

The SSSG provides a framework that unites all of these games and allows for a general consideration of the relative strategic values of the different points of a space. It implicitly encompasses the concepts of reachability, interdependence based on spatial structure and the detection radius, as discussed in Section 3.

Consider an example of the SSSG in which the strategy sets

One of the simplest possible mixed strategies available to each player in such a case is the mixed strategy that allocates equal probabilities to all points in a player’s strategy set.

While Proposition 4.4 is apparently simpler than Proposition 4.3, note that every part of its proof depends on the symmetric property of the distance (M2). If this condition were to be relaxed, as discussed in Section 4.1, Proposition 4.4 would not be valid and dominance and equivalence for Player B would have to be analysed on the basis of Proposition 4.3.

Note that both of these propositions depend on the symmetric property of the distance (M2) and the triangle inequality (M3).

The concepts of dominance and equivalence provide us with a method for reducing the SSSG through an iterative process of removing dominated strategies from

                        , reducing pairwise equivalent subsets to singletons and reassessing dominance in the new strategy sets. This is known as the iterated elimination of dominated strategies (IEDS) (see, for example, Berwanger, 2007; Börgers, 1992; Dufwenberg et al., 2002). Given any game, the aim of IEDS is to identify a simplified game, whose solutions are also solutions of the complete game. These solutions can then be identified using standard techniques (see, for example, Morris (1994, pp. 99–114)). The application of this method to games played over graphs is discussed in Section 6.

It should be noted that because we are considering weak rather than strict dominance, IEDS may not be suitable for identifying all the solutions of a particular game. The results of this form of IEDS are dependent on the order in which dominated strategies are removed (Leyton-Brown & Shoham, 2008, pp. 20–23) and some solutions may be lost. It is also necessary to observe that, while IEDS has been shown to be valid for games with finitely many possible strategies, for games with infinitely many possible strategies the process may fail (Berwanger, 2007). Indeed, such infinite games may not have solutions (Ruckle, 1983, p. 10).

However, though IEDS is not guaranteed to produce optimal mixed strategies for the SSSG in such cases, given a pair of mixed strategies

In this game, the pure strategies for each player are particular vertices. In the following analysis, we use the words “strategy” and “vertex” interchangeably, depending on the context.

The graph game is illustrated in Fig. 2

                         is not a significant constraint, since any graph game can be reduced to this case by means of a minor alteration.

The following proposition states that if Player A can search a globally maximal number of potential positions for Player B from a vertex v, then v is not dominated by any other vertex and is only equivalent to those vertices which have the same closed neighbourhood as v. In a graph in which all vertices have a distinct closed neighbourhood, such as a rectangular grid graph, such a vertex v cannot be very weakly dominated by any other vertex.

The next proposition is a stronger result. It states that, for Player A, given a vertex v that is known not to be very weakly dominated by any vertices outside of a certain subset S, if Player A can search strictly more potential hiding places for Player B when deployed at v than could be searched from any other vertex in S, then v is not very weakly dominated by any other vertex.

The following proposition is a restatement of Proposition 4.5, reformulated in the context of the graph game. It states that any vertex that very weakly dominates v for Player A can be no more than 2 steps away from v on the graph. Its proof is identical to that of Proposition 4.5 and is thus omitted.

The corollary states that any vertex from which Player A can search strictly more potential hiding places for Player B than could be searched from any other valid vertex lying no more than two steps away, cannot be very weakly dominated by any other vertex. These results allow us to considerably narrow down our search for dominated and equivalent vertices.

Analogous results to Propositions 5.2 and 5.3 and Corollary 1 hold for very weak dominance for Player B. The proofs of these results are similar to those presented above and are thus omitted.

A first step in the analysis of a particular graph game is to determine lower and upper bounds on the values of the game (see Definition 2.2).

Recall that for a two-player constant-sum game, it makes sense to restrict discussion to the value to Player A, since this also determines the value to Player B through the condition that the sum of the two values is a fixed constant (see (1)).

                         summarises the optimal mixed strategies, the true values of u (the value of

The results of Section 4.4 and Section 5.3 allow for the creation of an IEDS algorithm (see Section 4.5) for the graph game

                        . Since the game has finitely many strategies, this approach is always a valid method for finding a solution of the game (though it may not identify all optimal mixed strategies), as discussed in Section 4.5.

The algorithm identifies vertices that may be very weakly dominated for Player A or Player B and checks for dominance and equivalence over a small subset of their surrounding vertices. Very weakly dominated vertices are eliminated and the strategy sets for the players are iteratively reduced, forming sequences

                         respectively, until there is no dominance or equivalence in the remaining vertices. The aim is to simplify the game as far as possible, such that optimal mixed strategies can be more easily identified.

The explicit identification of vertices that cannot be dominated and the subsequent restriction of the set of vertices that should be examined when searching for dominance of a given vertex are intended to facilitate the creation of an efficient computer programme to apply IEDS in the graph game. An application of the algorithm in a very simple case is presented in Section 6.11.

Vertices are checked sequentially according to some pre-determined ordering and very weakly dominated vertices are removed and are not considered when searching for dominance and equivalence of any remaining vertices. Sequential checking and the immediate removal of identified vertices ensure that pairwise equivalent subsets are not eliminated from

Though a thorough investigation of the computational complexity of the algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper (and would depend to some extent on its precise implementation), a crude measure of the algorithm’s efficiency can be determined by considering the number of pairs of vertices that must be tested for very weak dominance before the algorithm terminates.

At each of Steps Three and Five, a particular vertex can be tested against no more than

Alternatively, since the algorithm only tests vertex pairs for very weak dominance if the distance between them is less than 3, at each of Steps Three and Five, a particular vertex will be tested against no more than

Which of these bounds is more useful will depend on the structure of the graphs under consideration.

In this section and the next, we demonstrate that the algorithm of Section 6.1 offers a distinct advantage over the method proposed by White (1994) for solving games played on trees (with 
                           
                              r

                              1
                           
                        ). Proposition 6.2 establishes that the algorithm always succeeds in reducing games of this type to cases that are trivially simple to solve, while Section 6.11 presents a simple example which shows that the algorithm can also be applied to games on graphs that are not trees. Also note that White (1994) exclusively considers situations where

A computer programme was written in Python (Python Software Foundation, 2012) using NumPy (Numpy Developers, 2012) to implement the algorithm of Section 6.1.

The single example presented here is clearly very simple and is included purely to demonstrate that the algorithm can be applied to games on graphs other than trees, though the extent to which it is able to simplify such game varies greatly. Note particularly that this example has

Note that this definition is valid for simple graphs. For more general graphs, which may include directed edges, loops, or multiple edges connecting the same vertices, a permutation of the edges also needs to be specified.

We extend the concept of a graph automorphism to that of a graph game automorphism, an automorphism of the graph that also preserves the strategic status of the vertices:

Note that in particular the proposition is true for 
                           
                              H
                              =
                              Γ
                              (
                              G
                              )
                           
                        . A proof of the proposition is presented in Appendix B.


                        Proposition 7.2 implies that, when looking for optimal mixed strategies for a graph game 
                           
                              G
                           
                        , it suffices to consider those strategies that allocate equal probability to all vertices lying in the same orbit under graph game automorphisms. For graphs with high numbers of symmetries, this can significantly simplify the analysis of the game.

Furthermore, the fact that the proposition is valid for any subgroup 
                           
                              H
                              ⩽
                              Γ
                              (
                              G
                              )
                           
                         ensures that even if not all graph game automorphisms of 
                           
                              G
                           
                         are known, to find a pair of optimal mixed strategies, it is sufficient to restrict consideration to those strategies that allocate equal probability to all vertices lying in the same orbit under the subgroup generated by those graph game automorphisms that can be identified.

Note that, though stated and proved in a different setting, this proposition is strongly related to Theorem 2.1 of Zoroa et al. (1993, pp. 526–528), which relates to games played over sets that admit certain transformations. However, Zoroa et al. require that the transformations considered be commutative, which is not necessarily true of the automorphisms of a graph.

The example of the graph game 
                           
                              G
                           
                         played over the

                              5
                           
                         rectangular grid 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    G
                                 
                                 
                                    5
                                    ,
                                    5
                                 
                              
                           
                         exhibits two curious and related properties.

Firstly, and most obviously, the optimal mixed strategies that were calculated for each player are identical 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    σ
                                 
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                              
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    σ
                                 
                                 
                                    B
                                 
                              
                              =
                              σ
                           
                        . This means that the optimal mixed strategy for Player A allocates identical probabilities to the vertices of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    G
                                 
                                 
                                    5
                                    ,
                                    5
                                 
                              
                           
                         as does the optimal mixed strategy for Player B (though these optimal mixed strategies need not be unique). Given the interpretation of the game, this is a surprising result. Player B is attempting to hide from Player A, so we might have expected that her best mixed strategy would involve avoiding vertices at which Player A was more likely to deploy.

Note that the method of Section 7.1 does not produce identical optimal mixed strategies for all graphs, nor for all grid graphs. For example, when applied to the 
                           
                              6
                              ×
                              6
                           
                         grid graph 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    G
                                 
                                 
                                    6
                                    ,
                                    6
                                 
                              
                           
                        , the method produces distinct optimal mixed strategies 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    σ

                              ,

                                    B
                                 
                              
                           
                         (see Fig. 7
                        ) that appear to be more consistent with our intuition, in that vertices to which 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    σ
                                 
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                              
                           
                         allocates fairly high probability seem to be allocated fairly low probability by 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    σ
                                 
                                 
                                    B
                                 
                              
                           
                         and vice versa.

Secondly, in Fig. 6, observe that for all vertices 
                           
                              v

                                    G
                                 
                                 
                                    5
                                    ,
                                    5
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                        , the sum of the probability oddments allocated by 
                           
                              σ
                           
                         to the vertices in the closed neighbourhood

                         is equal to 22. Formally, we make the following definition:

                        , if we can find a distribution of positive real numbers across the vertices such that the sum of these numbers in any closed neighbourhood is equal to a constant, and we scale these numbers to produce a valid probability distribution across the vertices, this distribution defines a mixed strategy that is optimal for both players. This offers an alternative approach to proving Corollary 3 on optimal mixed strategies for games played over regular graphs, since the mixed strategy 
                           
                              ρ
                           
                        , as defined in the corollary, is clearly an equal oddments strategy.

The concepts discussed in Section 7 suggest a potential approach for finding general expressions for the optimal mixed strategies of games played over certain families of graphs. To demonstrate this approach, we consider games played over a specific family of graphs, which we describe as poly-level graphs. The vertices in such graphs are arranged in levels and each vertex exhibits a local structural similarity in the way that it is connected to other vertices in its own level and to those in the levels above and below.

The appearance of a poly-level graph may be highly symmetric (Figs. 9 and 10) or quite irregular (Fig. 11). Also, two poly-level graphs with the same parameters may be topologically quite different (Fig. 12), while the parameters used to describe a particular poly-level graph are generally not unique (Fig. 13).

                         summarises the equal oddments strategies for the graphs shown in Figs. 9–11.

In this section, we have demonstrated that the concepts outlined in Section 7 may be used to find general expressions for optimal mixed strategies of games played over a particular family of graphs. It may therefore be possible to use or adapt this approach to seek optimal mixed strategies for games played over other families of graphs, thus suggesting a potentially valuable focus for future work.

In this paper, we have defined a search and concealment game, the SSSG, which differs from the games considered in the bulk of the literature both in its generality and in its explicit consideration of the strategic interdependence of positions based on spatial structure. We believe that formulating the game in terms of metric spaces may allow new tools and results from this area of mathematics to be applied to search and concealment problems, facilitating the identification of optimal mixed strategies in a variety of different cases.

We have examined the way in which the game theoretic concepts of dominance and equivalence of strategies are manifested in the context of the SSSG and have presented various methods for analysing the SSSG played over a graph, including:
                        
                           •
                           The reduction of graph games with detection radius

                               to games with 
                                 
                                    r
                                    =
                                    1
                                 
                              .

The formulation of lower and upper bounds on the value of a graph game.

An algorithm that applies the concept of IEDS in the explicit context of graph games and which has been demonstrated to reduce games played on trees to cases in which optimal mixed strategies can be immediately determined.

A method for simplifying the the analysis of graph games using automorphisms of the graph.

The introduction of the concept of an “equal oddments strategy”, and the demonstration that such mixed strategies are optimal for both players.

The presentation of explicit optimal mixed strategies for a particular family of graph games; those played over “poly-level graphs”.

In terms of future work, of immediate interest would be the extension of the results and methods of Sections 5 and 7, which have been formulated explicitly for the SSSG played over a graph, to the SSSG over a general metric space. It is our belief that analogues of many of these results could probably be formulated through the careful application of topology and measure theory. This would be an important first step in increasing the applicability and relevance of the SSSG.

With regard to the algorithm of Section 6, it would be useful to have explicit results on its computational efficiency and on how the structure of a graph affects the extent to which a corresponding graph game can be simplified using IEDS. It may be possible, for example, to identify other families of graph game (aside from those played on trees) for which the the method is particularly effective.

It would also be valuable to find analytic expressions for the optimal mixed strategies of a wider range of graph games, perhaps extending the ideas used to analyse games played over poly-level graphs to games played over rectangular lattices. For highly irregular graphs, algorithmic methods to find equal oddments strategies could be sought. Where equal oddments strategies do not exist, but where equal oddments ‘distributions’ that fail to satisfy (16) can nonetheless be found, an investigation into the connection between the true optimal mixed strategies and these invalid equal oddments distributions may be instructive.

Thinking more broadly, there are many ways in which the game could be extended. For example, by increasing the number of searching and concealing players, by allowing players to deploy at multiple points, by investigating situations in which payoffs are dependent on location, by relaxing the metric space axioms to consider directed graphs and other spaces, by investigating the game over weighted graphs or by allowing the players to move around the space.

For the SSSG as described, a particular area of interest is the analysis of games in which Ω is a region of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                     , where the searching player can search a disc of radius r. An understanding of such cases would make the game more applicable in real operational research scenarios, such as the deployment of patrol ships to locate pirates over areas of the ocean or searching archaeological sites for features of historical interest. If optimal mixed strategies cannot be obtained directly, one approach to such continuous situations would be to examine a discretised version of the game, superimposing a rectangular grid over the region in question and analysing a corresponding graph game over this grid.

Finally, it would be valuable to investigate the initial ways in which the SSSG could be profitably applied to real world scenarios. For example, following the riots in England in the summer of 2011, the game could be used to examine possible deployment strategies for the police. Manchester city centre, where a number of incidents occurred over a relatively compact area (Rogers, Sedghi, & Evans, 2011), could be represented as a graph to which the algorithm of Section 6 would be applied to determine the optimal location for a police unit (the searching player) to protect retail centres from a band of rioters (the concealing player). After the deployment of a first police unit, vertices within the detection radius could be removed and new optimal mixed strategies could be calculated on the rest of the graph to determine the placement of a second unit. It may be of interest to test the strategies obtained from such a process by simulation of an outbreak of rioting and to compare the results with the actual events of summer 2011.

To prove Proposition 7.2, we will use the following corollary of the theorem. It states that if two vertices 
                        
                           v
                           ,
                           
                           w
                        
                      of a graph game lie in the same orbit with respect to graph game automorphisms, then the number of graph game automorphisms that map v to some other vertex z is the same as the number that map w to z.
