                  This paper introduces a two-phase approach to solve average cost Markov decision processes, which is based on state space embedding or time aggregation. In the first phase, time aggregation is applied for policy optimization in a prescribed subset of the state space, and a novel result is applied to expand the evaluation to the whole state space. This evaluation is then used in the second phase in a policy improvement step, and the two phases are then alternated until convergence is attained. Some numerical experiments illustrate the results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recent developments in the theory and simulation techniques for Markov decision processes (MDP) (e.g., Busoniu, Ernst, Schutter, & Babuska, 2010; Cao, Ren, Bhatnagar, Fu, & Marcus, 2002; Chang, Fu, Hu, & Marcus, 2007; Leizarowitz & Shwartz, 2008; Powell, 2007) have led to a growing body of literature on MDP modeling for real world problems (e.g., Anderson, Boulanger, Powell, & Scott, 2011; Arruda & do Val, 2008; Pennesi & Paschalidis, 2010; Zhang & Archibald, 2011). Much of this increased interest is due, in part, to the development of powerful techniques to deal with MDPs of very large dimensions, encompassed in a framework known as approximate dynamic programming (ADP) (Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis, 1996; Powell, 2007; Sutton & Barto, 1998).

In the context of the ADP framework, there is a vast literature covering a variety of techniques, such as heuristic search (Hansen & Zilberstein, 2001) and real-time dynamic programming (Barto, Bradtke, & Singh, 1995; Bonet & Geffner, 2003), which make use of asynchronous updates and heuristic search to accelerate convergence, as well as topological value iteration (Dai & Goldsmith, 2007; Dai, Mausam, & Weld, 2009), that processes information related to the graphical features of MDPs to decide the optimal ordering of the value function updates. Asynchronous updates are also exploited in (Akramizadeh, Afshar, Menhaj, & Jafari, 2011; Moore & Atkeson, 1993), while a sequence of increasingly accurate approximate models is used in (Arruda, Ourique, LaCombe, & Almudevar, 2013).

Among the most popular ADP techniques one finds value function approximation (e.g., Arruda, Fragoso, & do Val, 2011; Boyan & Moore, 1995; Li & Littman, 2010), and simulation coupled with state space reduction (e.g., Arruda & do Val, 2008; Cao et al., 2002; Chang et al., 2007). There is a wide range of theory and applications within the ADP framework covering value function approximation techniques, especially for discounted cost MDP problems (see, e.g., Powell, 2012). In particular, the abstract representation of the value function in terms of algebraic decision diagrams (e.g., Hoey, St-aubin, Hu, & Boutilier, 1999; Joshi & Khardon, 2011; St-aubin, Hoey, & Boutilier, 2000) can be efficiently used to solve some large scale discounted MDPs. While much progress has been made and a few promising directions have been devised (e.g., Arruda et al., 2011; Ormoneit & Sen, 2002; Powell, 2007; Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997), convergence results for general approximation architectures remain to be proved. Moreover, performance bounds for such techniques tend to be very specialized (e.g., Gordon, 1995; Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997; Lin, Hui, Hua-Yong, & Lin-Cheng, 2009).

State space reduction techniques, known as embedding or time aggregation, can be traced back, in the context of control theory, at least to (Zhang & Yu-Chi, 1991), but we shall be particularly interested in the works of (Cao et al., 2002; Chang et al., 2007; Leizarowitz & Shwartz, 2008). It is well known that a great advantage of time aggregation is that, unlike state aggregation (e.g. Bertsekas, 2012), it preserves the Markov property. As a result, it can be used to produce an equivalent formulation with reduced state space. In that context, Fainberg (1986) studied the construction of embedded MDP models for the total cost criterion, whereas Leizarowitz and Shwartz (2008) investigated embedding techniques for average cost MDPs. An earlier work, (Cao et al., 2002), investigated embedding in a scenario where the control policy within a certain region of the state space is fixed and focused on reducing the computational burden of the solution procedure. This approach was later extended to deal with a continuous time stochastic control problem (Xu & Cao, 2011), and also inspired further work on algorithms for embedded (time aggregated) MDPs e.g., Ren and Krogh (2005), Sun, Zhao, and Luh (2007), Arruda and Fragoso (2011). Similar concepts were applied in the context of discount MDPs (Hauskrecht, Meuleau, Kaelbling, Dean, & Boutilier, 1998), where hierarchical models were employed to decompose the process. A thorough discussion of compact representations for MDPs can be found in (Boutilier, Dean, & Hanks, 1999).

The time aggregation approach, which transforms an MDP into another equivalent MDP with reduced state space, can be of great assistance when one wishes to find approximate solutions in reduced computational time. To accomplish such reduction, one can trade speed for accuracy and specify a priori an outer policy that prescribes a pure control action to each state outside of a prescribed region of interest F of the state space S. An appropriately optimized inner policy is then obtained and both outer and inner policies are composed to result in a sub-optimal policy over S. This policy minimizes the long term average cost over all control policies that adopt the prescribed outer policy. Note that optimality cannot be guaranteed unless the outer policy is optimal, i.e., it is comprised of optimal control actions for every state in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                           =
                           S
                           â§¹
                           F
                        
                     . In particular, optimality can be attained for large scale MDPs with a large number of uncontrollable states, i.e. states for which only a single control action is available (see Cao et al., 2002).

A distinguishing feature of this paper is that, unlike the current literature in time aggregation, it addresses also the problem of iteratively refining the outer policy. The rationale is simple: to apply time aggregation iteratively, but refining the outer policy at each iteration, until the outer policy converges to an optimal outer policy. At this point, the time aggregation approach is able to retrieve an optimal policy for the original MDP, over the entire state space S. The proposed outer policy refinement routine can be seen as a policy improvement step of the classical policy iteration algorithm e.g., Bertsekas (2012), which makes use of the value function of the latest policy obtained by time aggregation. A novel contribution of this paper is the way we derive this value function, making use of some new results that are introduced in this paper. Firstly, we prove that the value function obtained by the time aggregation algorithm for each state in the subset F is numerically equal to the value function obtained by a classical policy evaluation algorithm for this same state. We then make use of this result to derive the value function for each state in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                        
                      as the value of a classical stochastic shortest path problem starting from this state to reach any state in the target region F.

To sum up, we propose a two-phase time aggregation algorithm to solve MDPs to optimality. The two phases of the algorithm, which are applied successively up to convergence, work as follows: in the first phase, time aggregation is applied for some prescribed outer policy; then in the second phase, a policy improvement step is applied that refines the outer policy. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges monotonically to the optimal policy under general conditions on the structure of the MDP. It is worth pointing out that the proposed approach can be seen as a variation of the classical policy iteration algorithm with a policy search in the subset F at each iteration. The policy search is performed by the time aggregation algorithm, which finds the best possible policy in F given that the policy in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                        
                      is fixed.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the studied problem. Section 3 features the time aggregation approach and derives a novel result on the correspondence between the value functions of the embedded MDP and the original MDP, for a fixed control policy. This result is then applied in Section 4 to derive a two phase algorithm for the studied problem. The convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal solution is then proved in Section 4.1. Numerical experiments are presented in Section 5 to illustrate the approach, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

                      illustrates the concepts of inner and outer policies.

Typically the set F is a relatively small subset of S. It may be comprised, for example, of the states which are more important from some control standpoint, or the states that are expected to be visited more frequently under some particular class of control policies. For example, in a storage control problem, one would expect the set F to be comprised of the states that are within some desirable vicinity of the zero-stock state.

                     The time aggregation approach solves Problem (3), for some outer policy d prescribed a priori at the decision maker discretion. Naturally, unless d is the only feasible outer policy, solving Problem (3) involves some loss of performance, and optimality can no longer be guaranteed to the original problem. Indeed, selecting the outer policy d in such a way as to mitigate the loss of performance depends on the sensibility and prior knowledge of the decision maker.

                         maps the sequence of visits of the original MDP to the subset F. As a result, it has state space F and its properties can be determined by investigating the trajectories between consecutive visits to F.

The time aggregation approach involves dividing the original Markov chain into segments, each segment corresponding to a trajectory between two successive visits to the set F. Hence, the segment corresponding to a given state

                         and solve Problem (3). To solve this problem, one can apply the Incremental Value Iteration (IVI) algorithm in (Sun et al., 2007, Algorithm 2, page 2180). Loosely speaking, the IVI algorithm solves a series of parametric MDPs with a modified cost function

                        Lemma 1 derives a multi-step evaluation of the value function, which is applied to a specific stopping time in Corollary 2, which will be applied to derive the value function at a given state as a function of a stopping time. Lemma 3 applies this result to define a specific shortest path evaluation of the value function in a specific region of the state space.

In the remainder of this Section, and inspired by the results in Bertsekas (1998), we consider an associated stochastic shortest path (SSP) problem whose domain is the complementary region 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                         of the state space, where F is a subset of interest. In Lemma 3 we show how the solution of this problem can be used to derive the value function in 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                         as a function of the value function in F, obtained by time aggregation in Section 3.3. Hence, the proposed SSP will be used in conjunction with time aggregation to derive the value function in 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                        , which will be employed in a policy improvement step in the two-phase algorithm, introduced in Section 4. The policy improvement step will lead to an improved control policy in 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                        . This improved policy will be then fed back to the time aggregation step, thus resulting in an improved overall solution to the original problem. This process will be repeated in the two-phase algorithm, detailed in Section 4, until convergence is attained.

We now consider an associated stochastic shortest path problem to visit F for the first time from any state

                        SSP problem is slightly different from that of Bertsekas (1998) in that we define a target region

Then, in possession of the whole solution of the Poisson equation for the current policy, a policy improvement step (Puterman, 1994, Chapter 8) can be executed within the original MDP to find an improved outer policy

The optimal policy for this problem, a partial policy in F, is recovered in Step 3. Both partial policies are composed to result in a control policy for the original MDP in Step 4. Step 5 solves a Î»-SSP and applies Lemma 3 to recover the value function for the current policy, within the subset

                     . The complete value function is then used in a policy improvement step in Step 5, where a new partial control policy in

                      is obtained, and the process restarts in Step 2 until convergence is attained.

The computational issues of Step 2 and Step 5 are discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. It is worth mentioning, however, that one can directly solve (3) (Step 2 of Algorithm 1) and obtain the associated value function (Step 5 of Algorithm 1) at the same time by solving a modified MDP in the original state space, in which the feasible actions for all states in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                        
                      are limited to those prescribed by the outer policy 
                        
                           
                              
                                 d

                     , with no restriction to the control actions in F. In that sense, the time to solve this modified MDP â in the original state space â can be seen as an upper bound to the total time of executing Steps 2 and 5 of Algorithm 1. Thus, solving Problem (3) by time aggregation is recommended only when the sampling strategy makes it faster than solving an ordinary MDP with optimization in F, or whenever the size of the state space renders the latter algorithm intractable. For the sake of simplicity, we chose to solve the modified MDP described above in our numerical runs in Section 5.

We note that the proposed algorithm is a form of policy iteration with optimization in F, in which the outer states in

                      are updated simply based on a policy improvement step, while at the inner states in F an optimization is realized by means of time aggregation to find the best possible inner policy with respect to the outer policy. As the numerical experiments in Section 5 illustrate, this optimization routine can significantly accelerate the convergence of the algorithm with respect to the traditional policy iteration algorithm. The convergence of Algorithm 1 to the optimal policy is proved in the next subsection.

From Theorem 3, one can see that each new policy determined by Algorithm 1 is better than its previous counterpart in terms of average cost. That means that the algorithm converges in a finite number of iterations because, as the state and action spaces are finite, there are only a finite number of policies to choose from, and the average cost cannot be improved forever. It remains to be shown that the policy to which Algorithm 1 converges is indeed an optimal policy, and this result is proved in the next theorem.

Hence, by Theorem 1 it follows that the output of Step 4 of Algorithm 1 must be a solution to Problem 2, and that concludes the proof. â¡

The superiority of the proposed method over policy iteration comes from the fact that it obtains better bounds on the value function and on the long term average cost at each iteration, thus making a better usage of the computational resources. The improvement comes from the optimization in Step 2 of Algorithm 1, which allows a search for the optimal policy within the subset F, given a prescribed policy in

To illustrate the proposed approach, we solve a production and inventory problem with 3 classes of customers and a single machine, which can produce one product at a time and can alternate between products without any significant setup time. The demands for each class of customers is Poisson and arrives at rates

                     Thus, the stock/deficit costs are ordered in the inverse order of the demand rates, with the most demanded items having the smallest stock/deficit cost. Whenever a new demand arrives or the production of a new product is finished, the decision maker decides whether to continue the production for the same class of customers or to produce for another class of customers, or alternatively, to halt production. If the production is halted at the time a decision is made, the decision maker decides whether to keep the production halted or to start the production for one of the classes of customers. We also note that the production facility can continue production even if there is no customer waiting.

The maximal allowed backlog for each product is of 100 units, with no demand being accepted when this backlog level is reached and the maximal stock level allowed for each product is 25 units. Hence, the stock level of each product is an integer variable in the range

We compared the results obtained by Algorithm 1 with those obtained by a standard policy iteration algorithm (see, e.g., Puterman (1994)). Both algorithms yielded a long term average stock/deficit cost of 3.4095 monetary units, and their convergence is depicted below.

                     . Both algorithms were initialized with the same ad-hoc policy, which prescribes the production of the product with the lowest stock level, whenever this level is up to a maximum of 10 units. Otherwise, the production is halted. Whenever the lowest stock level is common to two or more products, we choose to produce that with the highest stock/deficit holding cost.


                     Fig. 2
                      shows the average cost evolution versus cumulative computation time for both the standard policy iteration algorithm and the proposed algorithm, with each bar corresponding to a single iteration. Note that the decrease in the average cost for the proposed 2-phase algorithm is much steeper, with the algorithm converging in 5 iterations. The policy iteration algorithm, on the other hand, takes 13 iterations to converge, with a less incremental decrease in the value function at each iteration. It is worth pointing out that the immediate decrease in the value function at the first iteration is due to the optimization in the set F that is performed at Step 2 of Algorithm 1. It may be argued that the region F is more important from a control standpoint, once one would expect a properly optimized policy to spend most of the time visiting low stock/deficit states. Hence, it may be expected that the actions taken at those states impact more in the long term average cost, and that is corroborated by the experimental results.

Comparing the results in Fig. 2 in terms of the cumulative computation time, one notes that the proposed approach is also significantly superior in terms of total elapsed time. In fact, the computation time is reduced from around 1422min to around 260min, which means that the proposed algorithm converges in about

                      of the total policy iteration convergence time. The experimental results are summarized in Table 1
                      below. One can see that, in this case, optimizing within an attractive region of the state space in terms of instantaneous cost function leads to the vicinity of the optimal policy in just two iterations, while it takes 12 iterations for the standard policy iteration to achieve similar performance. As pointed out earlier, the states in F tend to be visited more often in the long term, thus contributing more to the long term average cost. As a result, an optimization of the control policy in F tends to lead to substantial gains in the long term average cost, as the experiments demonstrate.

We saw in the last section that the use of the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance the performance with respect to standard policy iteration for a given selected subset F. In this subsection we strive to evaluate the effect of the set F on the performance of Algorithm 1. To accomplish that we set the region F as the set of states whose stock/deficit levels are in the interval

To facilitate the comparison, the cumulative computation time is normalized with respect to that obtained in the experiment of Section 5. Note that, although the average cost at the first iteration varies significantly for intervals

                        , the algorithm manages to maintain its performance both in terms of iteration count and computation time. For the remaining intervals, however, the changes are more significant: interval 
                           
                              I

                         requires six iterations and about 120% of the computation time for the original F, while interval 
                           
                              I

                         requires 7 iterations and 140% of the same reference computation time. The worst performance comes for interval 
                           
                              [
                              6
                              ,
                              25
                              ]
                           
                        , that requires 9 iterations and around 165% of the reference computation time.

The results suggest that, in this case, the algorithm seems to be relatively robust to the choice of F, its performance varying slowly around the set F suggested in the last section. That is a very interesting result, in that it shows that small variations in the set F tend not to compromise the performance of the algorithm. In the experiments we saw that the performance deteriorates once we get too far from the zero-stock region. That seems to be, in this case, because the low stock/deficit states tend to be more attractive from a control standpoint, once their costs are the most attractive. Hence, they tend to be the most visited if the system is properly managed, thus contributing more to the overall average cost. Selecting states close to this region ensures, in the present example, that the optimization in Step 2 of Algorithm 1 has the potential to result in substantial gain in terms of the long term performance of the system, as demonstrated by the experimental results. Finally, it is worth mentioning here that it should be necessary to go more deeply on the algorithm robustness issue regarding the choice of F, since the conclusion here was drawn from just one example. This also applies to the claim here regarding the low stock/deficit region as the most attractive region from a control standing point. Further foray on these issues is certainly necessary.

Considering the discussion in the preceding paragraph, one can infer that the performance will tend to that of the standard policy iteration algorithm for a choice of F too far the zero stock level. To demonstrate this effect we set up a new experiment where Algorithm 2 is run with

                        . The computation time is normalized with respect to that of the standard policy iteration algorithm, and the results are displayed in Fig. 4
                        .

As expected, the performance of the proposed algorithm is similar to that of standard policy iteration. That happens because we chose to compose the region F a set of states which are very bad from a control standpoint: large cost states which tend to be seldom visited for any reasonably good production/inventory policy. As a result, an optimization in this region does not result in an effective improvement in performance, as these states tend to contribute very little to the long term average cost. The results in Fig. 4 are consistent with this evaluation.

This paper proposes a two phase time aggregation based algorithm for solving average cost Markov decision processes. The algorithm combines a time aggregation step within a region of interest F and a stochastic shortest path solution procedure outside of this region. The first step determines a sub-optimal control in F and the value function corresponding to the best solution, given a prescribed control policy in

                     . Such a value function, used as termination cost of the stochastic shortest path problem, allows one to find the value function in

                     , which in turns permits the application of a classical policy improvement step that leads to the improvement of the control policy in

                                 c
                              
                           
                        
                     . Both steps are alternated until the algorithm converges. In addition, the convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal solution is proved and a numerical example illustrates the proposed approach.

The numerical experiment suggests that the optimization step in the subset F of the state space, prescribed by the proposed algorithm, can significantly reduce the convergence time both in terms of iteration count and total computation time with respect to standard policy iteration.

Future research directions include the application of the proposed approach to very large scale problems, possibly with a partial solution of the stochastic shortest path problem, constrained to a specific target region of the set 
                        
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                        
                     . Another possible line of research involves applying reinforcement learning techniques to approximate the value function in the complementary subset 
                        
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                        
                      for a fixed control policy, which would enable a posterior policy update step in this region.
