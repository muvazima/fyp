                  Green product development has become a key strategic consideration for many companies due to regulatory requirements and the public awareness of environmental protection. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a popular tool to measure the environmental impact of new product development. Nevertheless, it is often difficult to conduct a traditional LCA at the design phase due to uncertain and/or unknown data. This research adopts the concept of LCA and introduces a comprehensive method that integrates Fuzzy Extent Analysis and Fuzzy TOPSIS for the assessment of environmental performance with respect to different product designs. Methodologically, it exhibits the superiority of the hierarchical structure and the easiness of TOPSIS implementation whilst capturing the vagueness of uncertainty. A case study concerning a consumer electronic product was presented, and data collected through a questionnaire survey were used for the design evaluation. The approach presented in this research is expected to help companies decrease development lead time by screening out poor design options.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Due to increasing awareness of environmental issues, green product design (e.g., carbon reduction) has been a challenging new area of inquiry. There are many tools for green product design, some as simple as a checklist or the Materials, Energy, and Toxicity (MET) matrix. Among them, Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) has gained noteworthy attention. LCA is a scientific model used to analyse the environmental impacts of a product by taking its whole product life cycle, including material selection and production, manufacturing, usage, delivery, end-of-life treatment, and so on, into consideration (Hawkins, Hendrickson, Higgins, Matthews, & Suh, 2007; Yung et al., 2012). Conducting an LCA can help designers understand the environmental impacts of a design by quantifying the secondary (i.e., undesired) outputs of the whole life cycle and then converting them into measureable impact items for analysis (Cerdan, Gazulla, Raugei, Martinez, & Fullana-i-Palmer, 2009). LCA has been employed in various applications such as the electricity market (Stoppato, 2008), packaging materials (González-García et al., 2011), building projects (Tsai, Yang, Chang, & Lee, 2014), and so on.

Despite the popularity of LCA, a recent survey indicated that it is ranked as only the ninth most popular tool for eco-design (Knight & Jenkins, 2009). In contrast, some qualitative tools, such as the aforementioned checklist, guidelines, and simple analytical tools, such as MET, are voted as more popular than LCA. This may be partly attributed to the shortcomings of LCA. A survey indicated that 68% and 63% of respondents considered LCA time-consuming and costly, respectively (Cooper & Fava, 2008). In addition, accuracy of the data collection is also a barrier to successful LCA, and thus some studies are conducted taking this into account (e.g., Chan, Wang, White, & Yip, 2013). Handling data uncertainty and inaccuracy are important in the design stage because the final options are often not well-defined at that point. Furthermore, modelling or coding of the LCA required sophisticated, and usually proprietary, software (Favi, Germani, Marconi, & Mengoni, 2012; Vallet et al., 2013). In summary, conducting an LCA is not an easy task.

Therefore, there is a need to develop innovative approaches for, or to supplement, LCA. In this paper, a screening approach that can alleviate the shortcomings of LCA is proposed. To be precise, a hierarchical structure is employed to represent the life cycle of a product design in order to break down the complex problem into such a hierarchy. Then, fuzzy logic is used to take uncertainty into consideration as a screening tool. A hybrid, two-step approach is adopted (details to be discussed in Section 3). The proposed approach can be used as a screening tool to reduce the number of eco-design options and to identify key improvement areas. It is particularly useful in the early stages of design when different options can be evaluated and screened out. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the two methods employed in this study, followed by the descriptions of the model in Section 3. Then, Section 4 presents how the method can be applied in a real-life case study in selecting eco-design options. Numerical examples are provided in this section. The findings are then discussed in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes this paper.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of environmentally conscious practices (Carter & Carter, 1998; Rao & Holt, 2005; Sarkis, 1998; Yung et al., 2011). These practices include environmentally friendly design (sometimes referred to as eco-design), green procurement, sustainable operations, and a number of end-of-life practices such as recycling and remanufacturing. Environmental awareness may be a consequence of regulatory pressures to protect the environment. For example, the European Council’s directive (2009) on energy related products (ErPs) requires manufacturers to comply with eco-design principles in order to sell their products to the European Union. Preventive rather than corrective actions should be taken as early as possible during the design phase of ErPs in order to identify and reduce environmental impact of the product’s whole life cycle. This practice is becoming an important element in new product development. Decisions regarding raw materials selection, electricity consumption during use phase, packaging design, end-of-life treatment, etc. can potentially have a profound environmental impact. Adding eco-design principles to the design process may further burden organisations. On the other hand, however, it also helps to boost the progression of organisations to reduce adverse effects on the environment (Zhu & Sarkis, 2003).

In fact, the ErP directive is not the only regulation that can be found in the electronics industry. In recent years, other regulations have included the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive and also the aforementioned ErP Directive (Trappey, Ou, Lin, & Chen, 2011). Given its short life cycle, the electronic industry is considered one of the fastest growing streams of waste generation (Gurauskienė & Varžinskas, 2006). If an electronic product cannot comply with any one of these directives, it is prohibited from being traded in the member states of the European Union. There is, however, no universally applicable tool to show compliance with these regulations; thus, the ErP Directive was created partly to address this issue (Yung et al., 2011). This is the motivation for this study’s proposal of an LCA-based fuzzy methodology for green product development.

LCA is a systematic and scientific tool that can help designers analyse the environmental impact of a product and has been applied in various applications over the last three decades (Guinée et al., 2011). In an LCA, a product’s whole life cycle is taken into consideration (Junnila, 2008). This means that LCA can provide the designers a complete view of the environmental output and, hence, the impacts of the product. Because of this unique feature, LCA has attracted increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners, and numerous studies can be found in the literature (e.g., Bovea & Gallardo, 2006; Kobayashi, 2005; Thoming & Erol, 2005). LCA may also be employed to address legislative mandates, especially in light of the requirements introduced in the European Union (e.g., the ErP directive) (Trappey et al., 2011; Yung et al., 2012).

In essence, LCA involves multiple life cycle phases and requires the assessment of different environmental aspects (European Council, 2009). It is not uncommon that decision-making problems involve multiple criteria. The problems are even more difficult to address if some of the criteria are qualitative in nature. Saaty (1978) developed a well-known Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which can handle such Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problems. The basic idea is to represent such problems by a hierarchical structure with different criteria and sub-criteria. Then, pairwise comparisons among those criteria are performed so that the weightings of the criteria (or priority in some applications) with respect to the problem can then be estimated. AHP is one of the widely used approaches to prioritise multiple factors that can affect decisions involving multiple judging criteria, and tradeoffs can always be found between different factors (Tan, 2005). Applications of AHP are numerous (Ho, 2008).

Although the discrete scale of AHP has the advantage of simplicity and ease of use for pair-wise comparison of alternatives, it has often been criticised from several perspectives in the literature (Bana e Costa & Vansnick, 2008; Belton & Stewart, 2002; Smith & von Winterfeldt, 2004). One of main criticisms is that AHP cannot handle the uncertainty and ambiguity present in deciding the ratings of different attributes (Chan & Kumar, 2007). Uncertainty, which comes from inaccurate measurement, lack of data, model assumptions, etc., often complicates the interpretation of outcomes of LCAs (Huijbregts, 1998). On the one hand, not addressing the uncertainties of LCAs will call into question the outcomes of LCAs. On the other hand, incorporating uncertainty into the LCA will improve the value of its outcome but make it more complicated to perform. It is acknowledged in the literature that quantifying uncertainties in LCA will support informed decision making and prevent erroneous decision making that might result from neglecting uncertainties (Cowell, Fairman, & Lofstedt, 2002; Lenzen, 2006). Another stream of research uses fuzzy logic, which can handle uncertain information, to mitigate this weakness (Zadeh, 1965). In this paper, the two approaches employed are Fuzzy Extent Analysis and Fuzzy Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The former was developed by Chang (1996) and the non-fuzzy version of the latter was introduced by Hwang and Yoon (1981). This section briefly summarises the two approaches and provides reasons for why an integrated approach is needed.

The first application (or evolution) of fuzzy AHP is to replace deterministic values in the pairwise comparisons process with linguistic parameters (e.g., more important, very important, and so on), which are characterised by fuzzy membership functions (Van Laarhoven & Pedrycz, 1983). Later, Chang (1996) developed the Fuzzy Extent Analysis to help formulate the multi-tier fuzzy decision-making process. Like the basic fuzzy AHP, the fuzzy judgement matrix is first constructed with the help of linguistic parameters. Then, the synthetic degree value is calculated (instead of defuzzifying the matrix). These values are also fuzzy numbers, and because of this analysis, the method is called extent analysis. The main advantage of this method is that the computational effort is reduced. Since its inception, the method has been used in many applications. For example, Kahraman, Cebeci, and Ulukan (2003) applied this method for the supplier selection problem using three main criteria: supplier criteria, product performance criteria and service performance criteria in the hierarchical model. Lee, Kang, Hsu, and Hung (2009) employed a similar approach to analyse the green supplier selection problem in the hi-tech industry. Environmental factors, such as green product development, environmental management, and so on, are added to the hierarchical model. Wang, Li, and Shi (2012) applied Fuzzy Extent Analysis to develop a risk assessment model that enabled a structured analysis of aggregative risk in the food supply chain. The Fuzzy Extent Analysis method has also attracted applications in the service industry. For example, Vahidnia, Alesheikh, and Alimohammadi (2009) applied Fuzzy Extent Analysis in choosing a hospital location. They also compared the method with other fuzzy approaches and concluded that Fuzzy Extent Analysis is simpler to use. Chan et al. (2013) employed the same fuzzy approach for green product design evaluation. This paper is a direct extension of the work of Chan et al. (2013). Like many other models, however, Fuzzy Extent Analysis also has its problems, despite its usefulness and numerous applications found in the literature. For example, Wang, Luo, and Hua (2008) argued that the method could not make full use of all of the fuzzy comparison matrices information and might assign an irrational zero weight to some useful decision criteria. This may lead to incorrect decisions.

Another technique to solve MCDM problems is TOPSIS. The main concept of TOPSIS is to define the positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution. The positive ideal solution maximises the benefit criteria and minimises the cost criteria. The negative ideal solution maximises the cost criteria and minimises the benefit criteria. The most preferred alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution and the longest distance from the negative ideal solution. Despite its popularity and simplicity in concept, TOPSIS, similar to AHP, is often criticised because of its inability to address the uncertainty and imprecision inherent to the process of mapping the perceptions of decision makers (Krohling & Campanharo, 2011). Some scholars have made use of fuzzy logic to address this limitation of TOPSIS. Fuzzy TOPSIS has been applied to solve various MCDM problems such as Ertuğrul and Karakaşoğlu (2008), Chamodrakas, Alexopoulou, and Martakos (2009), Büyüközkan and Çifçi (2012), Wang and Chan (2013), Kannan, Jabbour, and Jabbour (2014) and so on. In relation to this study, Ng and Chuah (2012) employed Fuzzy TOPSIS for evaluating different eco-design alternatives, which not only demonstrates the shortcomings of LCA mentioned in Section 1 but also outlines the advantages of using fuzzy logic to aid the decision-making process. Like other methods, the TOPSIS method and its extended Fuzzy TOPSIS version have their merits, but they also have some limitations. For example, there is a lack of comparative analysis of different criteria, and the approach separates qualitative and quantitative variables (Ertuğrul & Karakaşoğlu, 2008). This characteristic makes fuzzy TOPSIS more applicable to one-tier decision problems rather than multi-tier decision problems (Bottani & Rizzi, 2006). In fact, Ertuğrul and Karakaşoğlu (2008) compared the Fuzzy Extent Analysis and the Fuzzy TOPSIS on the same problem, factory location selection. They concluded that the former is more preferable for widely spread hierarchies, whereas the latter is more suitable for single-tier problems.

Some researchers have attempted to merge the merits of Fuzzy Extent Analysis with fuzzy TOPSIS to gain the advantages from both models and to mitigate the weaknesses of each. For instance, Büyüközkan, Feyzioğlu, and Nebol (2008) combined the Fuzzy Extent Analysis and Fuzzy TOPSIS as a two-step approach to select strategic alliance partners in the logistics industry. The former is utilised for determining the weights of the criteria of the AHP, which means the problem can be formulated as a hierarchical structure. Then, the latter is used for determining the ranking of different options. Gumus (2009) also applied a similar two-step approach to study the performance of different transportation firms in terms of their transportation of hazardous waste. In the service sector, Seçme, Bayrakdaroğlu, and Kahraman (2009) used the same approach to evaluate the performance of different banks. Along these lines, this study attempts to apply a similar two-step approach to support the eco-design selection. The proposed methodology will benefit from both the superiority of the hierarchical structure of AHP and the easiness of implementation of TOPSIS in a fuzzy environment. At the same time, it is able to capture the vagueness of uncertainty, and it provides the efficiency and flexibility to incorporate the subjectivity and preferences of experts’ judgement in the eco-design evaluation. It should help engineers and/or designers to take the environmental issues into consideration when evaluating alternative design options. Details of the model are presented in the next section.

Built on the concept of LCA, the proposed methodology consists of a hierarchical evaluation model, Fuzzy Extent Analysis, and Fuzzy Hierarchical TOPSIS techniques. In the hierarchical model, the critical aspects for achieving the goal of green product development are first defined, and the criteria of each aspect are identified. Then, Fuzzy Extent Analysis is used to determine the relative importance evaluation criteria. Finally, the Fuzzy Hierarchical TOPSIS is used to evaluate alternative design options. The detailed descriptions of the main steps are elaborated in each of the following sections.

Evaluating environmentally friendly product design requires a systematic approach to take all environmental issues throughout the product life cycle into account. In this research, the multitier AHP framework proposed by Chan et al. (2013) to assess green product designs is adapted. In their research, a five level hierarchical model is proposed as illustrated in Fig. 1
                        .

After the overall objective is defined, it is then categorised into 6 main life cycle phases: raw material selection and use (L1), manufacturing (L2), packaging, transport, and distribution (L3), installation and maintenance (L4), usage (L5), and end-of-life (L6). Nevertheless, as Chan et al. (2013) stated, the number of phases for evaluation is not necessarily restricted to six as proposed above because some products may not involve all 6 phases. The hierarchy is then descended to more detailed evaluation criteria within each life cycle phase in the third level. Data such as bill of material, manufacturing processes, transportation modes and end of life cycle practices should be collected to identify detailed evaluation criteria. At Level 4, the environmental impact assessment is carried out for all identified criteria. It involves five types of environmental assessments: consumption of material, energy and other resources (EA1), emission to air, water or soil (EA2), anticipated pollution (EA3), generation of waste material (EA4), and possibility of re-use, recycling, and recovery of materials and/or of energy (EA5). The outputs of all five assessments should then be aggregated to obtain the environmental performance for alternative designs. The considered product design alternatives (An
                        ) are located at the bottom level of the hierarchy.

Here, the fuzzy synthetic extent analysis method is introduced to calculate the synthetic extent value of the pairwise comparison. An extent analysis adaptation to fuzzy AHP was proposed by Chang (1996) to obtain a crisp priority vector from a triangular fuzzy comparison matrix. The triangular fuzzy scale of preferences is given in Table 1

                        9 are used to represent the pairwise comparison of decision variables ranging from “Equal” to “Absolute,” when these are employed as descriptive terms attached to the level of importance of paired variables, and TFNs M

When applied to the environmental assessment, m equals the number of criteria identified in the entire life cycle phases multiplied by the number of environmental assessments. According to the method of extent analysis (Chang, 1996), each object is taken and then extent analysis is performed for each goal. Therefore, the m extent analysis values for each object are obtained as:

To verify the accuracy of the method, the consistency measure is performed to screen out inconsistency between responses. Because Mi
                         is a triangular number, it has to be defuzzified into a crisp number to compute the consistency ratio (CR). The Centre of Area (COA) approach is used here for defuzzifying Mi

According to the index value, the alternative design options can be ranked from the most preferred to the least preferred feasible solutions.

In this section, a case study on a manufacturing company is presented to illustrate how the proposed fuzzy methodology can be applied to support decision making for environmentally friendly product design evaluation. The company produces wireless personal electronic products and would like to incorporate environmental issues into their product design because any decisions made in this stage could have a profound environmental impact throughout its entire product life cycle. An LCA was initially conducted for one of their electronic products. Details of the LCA results were reported in Yung et al. (2011, 2012), and Chan et al. (2013). In these studies, LCA was also proven to be a time-consuming and tedious process. In this study, the authors make reference to this case to demonstrate how the proposed model can facilitate and simplify new product development from an eco-design perspective, especially when an LCA has already been conducted.

With reference to the case (Yung et al., 2011, 2012; Chan et al., 2013), the main life cycle phases are defined, and the key criteria under each phase are identified, as illustrated in Table 2
                     . Relevant data such as bill of material and manufacturing processes have to be collected to construct a hierarchical structure. After constructing the hierarchical model, it is essential to know how important one life cycle phase (or its associated criterion) is over another for eco-design purposes. In other words, decision makers have to determine the weights between main life cycle phases and the associated criteria. A questionnaire was distributed to a panel of experts to evaluate the importance of each criterion identified throughout the product life cycle phases. Screenshots of the questionnaire are provided in the appendix. The questionnaire was sent to five experts: two engineers from the R&D department, the production manager of the case company, and two academics in the Operations Management field. Two members of the panel were involved in the original LCA project. Details of four different design options were presented to the experts before the evaluation. Once the responses were received, the questionnaire results were checked for invalid and/or missing data and, if necessary, interviews were conducted to ensure the data validity. The collected data were then used to estimate the evaluation criteria weights through Fuzzy Extent Analysis and then evaluate alternative designs with Fuzzy TOPSIS. Because the evaluation of different experts would lead to different matrices, the opinions of different experts are integrated to form one synthetic pairwise comparison matrix through the geometric mean method proposed by Buckley (1985). The same method was applied to the fuzzy TOPSIS evaluation.

The different weights of the life cycle phases and their associated criteria were calculated using the Fuzzy Extent Analysis discussed in Section 3.2. Using the main life cycle phases as an example, the fuzzy comparison matrix of five phases is constructed. The importance ratings through the pairwise comparison of the five phases with respect to the goal are expressed by TFNs, as shown in Table 3
                     . The different values of fuzzy synthetic extent with respect to the four main criteria are denoted by S

                     2, S

Based on Eq. (7), we obtain:


                     d(L
                     1)=min V(S
                     1
                     ⩾
                     S
                     2, S
                     3, S
                     4, S
                     5)=min (1, 1, 1, 1)=1.

Similarly, d(L
                     2)=0.73, d(L
                     3)=0.27, d(L
                     4)=0.24, d(L
                     5)=0.38.

Therefore, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 W
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     =(1, 0.73, 0.27, 0.24, 0.38) after the normalisation process; thus, the weight vector with respect to the five life cycle phases, L
                     1, L
                     2, L
                     3, L
                     4, and L
                     5, can be expressed as: W
                     =(0.381, 0.278, 0.104, 0.093, 0.144).

Using the same approach, the relative importance weights of identified evaluation criteria with respect to their associated life cycle phases was conducted, and the results are summarized in Table 4
                     . The final weight scores for the evaluation criteria were obtained by calculating the product of the criteria weight scores and the weight scores of its associated life cycle phase. Simultaneously, the consistency ratio of each judgement was calculated and checked to ensure that it was lower than or equal to 0.1.

After that, Fuzzy Hierarchical TOPSIS was employed for the evaluation of four alternative designs. As described earlier, the panel of experts gave performance ratings to the four alternative designs with respect to five environmental assessments against the evaluation criteria. The qualitative explanation of rating levels and their corresponding TFNs are described in Table 5
                     .

The results were then used to constitute a hierarchical decision making matrix 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D

                      as illustrated in the Supplementary Data (Table S1). The hierarchical decision making matrix was then normalized using Eq. (13). Through computing the product of the normalized hierarchical decision matrix

                      and the final weight scores for each evaluation criterion, the weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix

                      is obtained, as shown in Table 7
                     . The largest generalized mean and the smallest generalized mean of each main criterion could then be selected, constituting the FPIS (A+
                     ) and the FNIS (A
                     −). Now, the distances to the most positive ideal solution and the most negative ideal solution for each alternative (dk
                     
                     + and dk
                     
                     −) could be calculated as in Eqs. (22) and (23). Finally, the relative closeness index for each alternative design could be obtained using Eq. (25). The results are presented in Table 8
                     , along with the corresponding rankings based on the index values. Among the four alternative designs, design 2(A
                     2) has the highest relative closeness index and therefore is recommended as the most eco-friendly design option.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Researchers and practitioners now widely acknowledge that eco-design is increasingly important for designers to consider during new product development (e.g., Chan et al., 2013). This is because decisions made in the design stage could have a profound environmental impact throughout the entire product life cycle. Being a demonstrated eco-friendly product could improve brand image and offer an important avenue for increasing product value. However, being eco-friendly requires taking the environmental impacts of the whole product life cycle into consideration. LCA is often used as a comprehensive and practical tool for such an assessment (Huntzinger & Eatmon, 2009; Hur, Lee, Ryu, & Kwon, 2005; Yung et al., 2011, 2012; Chan et al., 2013). LCA is a scientifically robust tool, and one of its main advantages is comprehensiveness. A standard LCA consists of a goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation (ISO, 1997). After defining the goal and scope definition, material and energy inputs and waste and emissions data throughout a product’s life cycle have to be collected, and the environmental loads need to be quantified in the inventory analysis. Environmental impact assessment can be then used to examine the potential and actual environmental effects from the use of materials and energy before interpreting the results.

However, as discussed in Section 1, a comprehensive LCA is a tedious and time consuming process because it requires substantial data and scientific evidence. Many organisations, especially SMEs, do not have sufficient resources and expertise to conduct a full LCA. In addition, LCA has difficulty in handling uncertain and/or unknown data, which is often common during the product design phase. Application of this fuzzy methodology can help firms to prioritise alternative new designs in a timely manner. By adopting the concept of LCA that considers all important aspects of a product life cycle, the proposed methodology can serve as an efficient way to develop environmentally sound design solutions. Instead of undermining the usefulness of LCA or replacing LCA, this research aims to use it as a supplement when companies have had difficulty carrying out a traditional LCA due to uncertain and/or unknown data at the design phase. It also provides a shortcut to designers for screening out less feasible design options. A full LCA is still recommended especially in regard to final design options that exhibit a similar relative closeness index.

The main goal of this paper has centred on proposing a methodology for evaluating alternative design options for eco-design purposes. In particular, the research has applied the methodology in an industrial case of a consumer electronics manufacturer to evaluate alternative product designs for one of its personal electronics products. The proposed methodology is based on a hierarchical model proposed by Chan et al. (2013) and an integrated Fuzzy Extent Analysis and Fuzzy Hierarchical TOPSIS. The use of the integrated approach is tractable enough to capture the data uncertainty and to provide the efficiency and flexibility to tap the subjectivity and preferences of decision makers. In terms of computation, referring to Chang (1996), for a n
                     ×
                     n fuzzy pairwise comparison, the time complexity of synthetic extent analysis is n(n
                     +6). The complexity of calculations often inhibits organisations from implementing sophisticated methods in their daily operations. Incorporating fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy Extent Analysis as an integrated methodology has significantly reduced the number of pairwise comparisons required to make a design selection decision compared to the method in Chan et al. (2013). In fact, all calculations can be done in an Excel spreadsheet; thus, it can be adopted easily in the industry, without requiring expensive software. Therefore, it is a more effective and practical decision-supporting tool for performing such an assessment. This could offer opportunities for application in companies across a wide range of industrial sectors to facilitate eco-design evaluation by engineers and designers.

A main purpose for LCA is to identify improvement options for green product development. Using the relative closeness index, the case study found that Design 2 (A2) tops the ranking list among the four alternative designs, followed by Design 3 (A3) and Design 4 (A4). Nevertheless, it is important to examine the critical life cycle phases and the corresponding criteria that have higher environmental impacts. To provide insights into the selection decision, further analysis was conducted. Because Design 1 was at the bottom of the ranking list, it was not included in the analysis. Fig. 3
                      shows the environmental performance ratings of the remaining three alternative designs with respect to the main life cycle phases. Overall, the material selection phase (L1) contributes the most to the environmental impacts, followed by the manufacturing phase (L2). Crucially, Design 2 (A2) has a better environmental performance than other designs during these two life cycle phases. It is the key reason that Design 2 stands out among the alternative designs.

Furthermore, the outputs of environmental assessments are dependent on all criteria throughout the product life cycle, and individual criteria contribute to each environmental assessment differently. Each design option exhibits its own strengths and weaknesses in different evaluation areas, which is reflected in the analysis of aggregated environmental performance of the three alternative designs with respect to detailed evaluation criteria, as displayed in Fig. 4
                     . For example, although Design 4 has a relatively better performance in packaging (C31), transportation (C32), and evaluation criteria in the end of life cycle phase (C51, C52, C53, C54, and C55), Design 4 is still the less preferred design option because of its high environmental impact during both the material selection and manufacturing phases. Due to the characteristics of this personal electronic product, these areas remain the most crucial criteria. Nevertheless, this should not compromise the evaluation criteria within other life cycle phases. In fact, it is important for designers to take a balanced approach when evaluating design options for eco-design purposes. To make further improvement of the selected design (Design 2), the specifications of other design options can also be considered if the adoption of these specifications does not compromise its exiting environmental performance.

In addition to the environmental constraints addressed in the research, the nature of customer demand and the organisation also introduces operational constraints into the design of product. These are many and varied and may change over time, but they typically include labour and material cost pressures, the design of safe and efficient production systems, the type of transport that is used, the availability of materials and the specific quality requirements of the product that is being developed. While this research focuses only on the evaluation of environmental performance, it is also crucial to incorporate the economic cost of the various possible alternative designs and the impact of the competitive reactions to designs on the product demand over its life cycle to achieve an ultimate sustainable new product development.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Green product development plays an increasingly important role in moving our society towards a greener economy. Eco-design is a competitive strategy for manufacturers to satisfy diverse requirements from customers and policymakers. In the electronics industry, product life cycles are becoming shorter and shorter, while the demand for green product development is becoming higher and higher due to regulatory pressure, customer awareness, and so on. It is currently virtually impossible for companies to conduct LCA for all products and associated design alternatives. Therefore, the proposed method can cut short the development lead time to screen out various design options. This is especially useful in the electronics industry because modular designs and mass customisation are very popular. These practices make the application of the proposed approach even easier and can help to prioritise alternatives and select new design options for product improvement in a timely manner.

To be clear, the aim of the proposed approach is not to replace LCA or undermine the usefulness of LCA. LCA remains a scientifically robust tool for analysing the environmental impacts of a design. However, from the managerial point of view, our model makes to two key contributions. First, it is often difficult to conduct a traditional LCA during the design phase due to limited or uncertain data. Our model can still be used by firms to evaluate the environmental performance of product designs because it is capable of handling uncertain data and incorporating the experts’ judgements into eco-design evaluation. Second, it provides a complementary to LCA for the purpose of screening out poor design options. Practically, completing a full LCA for each design option is a time-consuming process and requires extensive resources. The proposed methodology provides an alternative for the screening purpose that does not require proprietary LCA software for analysis and is less demanding in terms of the time and data requirements. Moreover, there is a methodological contribution in merging Fuzzy Extent Analysis and Fuzzy TOPSIS. The integrated fuzzy methodology exhibits its superiority of the hierarchical structure and easiness of TOPSIS implementation. It is also able to capture the vagueness of uncertainty, and it provides the efficiency and flexibility to tap the subjectivity and preferences of decision makers. Through the application in the case study, it has been shown to be an effective and realistic modelling approach for eco-design evaluation. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to use this integrated approach for eco-design applications. Finally, through the case study, it provides insights into how sensitivity analysis of findings from the application of the proposed integrated methodology can support rational decision making processes for green product development.

Despite the benefits outlined above, the research has its own limitations that could lead to future research opportunities. For instance, whilst this research only focuses on evaluating the environmental performance of alternative new product designs, it is also important to take other relevant operational and economic factors into account. Therefore, one future research opportunity is to integrate the economic, social and environmental factors into the development of a multi-objective treatment of sustainable design evaluation. Another limitation of the proposed methodology is that decision makers have to make subjective decisions in the pair-wise comparisons and conduct environmental impact assessments for alternative designs. Using objective data sources when available instead of subjective decision making could lead to more accurate decisions. Therefore, one future research direction is to consider a more objective weighting technique such as an entropy method or Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA).

Finally, like many other MCDM methods, rank reversal for AHP, which was first addressed by Belton and Gear (1983), is a potential problem for the proposed method. Rank reversal means the decision will change if a new alternative is added or removed that, in principle, should not change the decision (e.g., add a copy of an existing alternative that is not the best one). It is not the intention of the authors to discuss this in detail as this is outside of the scope of this study, which does not concern the theoretical development in this area. Therefore, readers are referred to Maleki and Zahir (2013) who conducted an excellent review to summarise and categorise different studies on rank reversal, specifically linking to AHP for more information. There are many methods proposed by other scholars that can be applied in the proposed method. To name a few, Belton and Gear (1983) proposed a method that makes use of the maximum value rather than the sum of the weights for basic normalisation (i.e., Eq. (7)). Barzilai and Lootsma (1997) suggested a multiplicative approach to replace the additive approach in determining the weightings to preserve the ranking. More recently, Wang and Elhag (2006) claimed that such rank reversal is due to the alteration of local priorities before and after an alternative is added or removed. They developed a procedure to avoid altering the local priorities when the changes occur. Despite the availability of these studies, it is still arguable whether rank reversal is avoidable (Barzilai & Golany, 1994).
