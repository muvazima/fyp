                  We give an axiomatization of the Aumann–Shapley cost-sharing method in the discrete case by means of monotonicity and no merging or splitting (Sprumont, 2005). Monotonicity has not yet been employed to characterize this method in such a case, by contrast with the case in which goods are perfectly divisible, for which Monderer and Neyman (1988) and Young (1985b) characterize the Aumann–Shapley price mechanism.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper we provide an axiomatization for the Aumann–Shapley cost-sharing method in the discrete case by employing a monotonicity property. Aumann–Shapley pricing is a method for solving cost-sharing problems in which agents consume a quantity of possibly different goods. Assuming that a finite set 
                        
                           N
                           =

                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           n
                           }
                        
                      denotes the set of agents 
                        
                           i
                           ,

                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                      is the quantity of good i demanded by agent i and q is the corresponding consumption profile, we want to split 
                        
                           C
                           (
                           q
                           )
                        
                      among the agents. Goods may be priced instead of sharing the cost 
                        
                           C
                           (
                           q
                           )
                        
                     . The two approaches are equivalent, and we have chosen the latter, following Sprumont (2005).

In the discrete case agents can consume several units of the good. The consumption 
                        
                           
                              
                                 q
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                      of agent i is a non-negative integer which indicates how many units of good i are consumed by agent i. A simple cost-sharing method for solving such problems is the Shapley–Shubik method introduced by Shubik (1962). Given a coalition 
                        
                           S
                           ⊆
                           N
                        
                      of agents, Shubik considers the cost of the consumptions of those agents: 
                        
                           v
                           (
                           S
                           )
                           =
                           C
                           (
                           
                              
                                 q

                     ; and calculates the Shapley value (1953) of the transferable utility game v with N as the set of players. This Shapley value gives precisely the assignment by the Shapley–Shubik method. The Aumann–Shapley method is also defined by means of a transferable utility game, but now more information about cost is taken into account. Indeed, costs of intermediate consumptions of agents are considered and not just those associated with consumptions

                     . Given an agent i, each unit consumed by i is viewed as a different player, so there is a set

The Aumann–Shapley pricing originates in the work of Billera, Heath, and Raanan (1978), when these authors used Aumann and Shapley’s (1974) theory of values for nonatomic games to set the telephone billing rates in order to share the cost of service among the users. Subsequently, Billera and Heath (1982) and Mirman and Tauman (1982) transfer the axiomatic approach introduced by Aumann and Shapley (1974) to characterize this pricing mechanism for cost-sharing problems in which goods are perfectly divisible. Samet and Tauman (1982) offer an axiomatic characterization for the Aumann–Shapley price mechanism based on the one given by Dubey, Neyman, and Weber (1981) for the semivalues; and latterly, McLean, Pazgal, and Sharkey (2004) propose another one using the potential and consistency. We also find many applications of Aumann–Shapley pricing, notably from the pioneering works as the above by Billera et al. (1978) and Samet, Tauman, and Zang (1984) to the contributions made by Castaño-Pardo and García-Díaz (1995), Kruś and Bronisz (2000) and Haviv (2001), or the more recent works by Faria, Barroso, Kelman, Granville, and Pereira (2009), Pierru (2010) and Chen, Iyengar, and Moallemi (2013). These applications range from the pricing of transportation, water, phone, electricity or highways, to the allocation of firm-energy rights, the allocation of the

                      emissions, the analysis of systemic risk or the study of multiple commodity situations. Another related work is Hougaard and Tind (2009), where parametric programming is employed to study the Aumann–Shapley pricing.

Only more recently the discrete case has been given attention. The Aumann–Shapley method is characterized in two papers. In the first, by Calvo and Santos (2000), the method is characterized by means of Balanced Contributions, as Myerson (1980) does for the Shapley value, and requiring agents who consume nothing to pay zero. In the second Sprumont (2005) employs Additivity, Dummy and No Merging or Splitting. Dummy is the natural extension for cost-sharing problems of the Dummy axiom for transferable utility games. It requires that dummies get zero. An agent i is a dummy if there are no consumption profile whose cost changes if i consumes one more unit. No Merging or Splitting, which is described in detail in Section 3, prevents splitting manipulations. Accordingly, if an agent i splits into several agents (and therefore splits his/her consumption into several consumptions), the split agents have to pay in sum the same quantity as agent i had to. The characterization by Sprumont (2005) can be seen as formed by basic axioms, like the one given by Mirman and Tauman (1982) for the Aumann–Shapley price mechanism with perfectly divisible goods and Shapley’s (1953) characterization of his value.

A look at other characterizations for the Aumann–Shapley price mechanism with perfectly divisible goods reveals that Monotonicity has also been employed, as Young (1985a) does when he characterizes the Shapley value. Monotonicity for cost-sharing problems states that if the marginal costs associated with an agent at all consumption levels decrease, then the cost share corresponding to that agent cannot increase. Young (1985b) and Monderer and Neyman (1988) obtain two characterizations for the Aumann–Shapley price mechanism using this axiom. In this paper we provide precisely an axiomatization for the Aumann–Shapley method with Monotonicity. We prove that this method is the only one that satisfies Monotonicity and No Merging or Splitting. Thus, we prove that Additivity and Dummy can be replaced by Monotonicity in the characterization of Sprumont (2005). Observe that the same happens when Young (1985a) characterizes the Shapley value (1953) for transferable utility games with Symmetry and Monotonicity. Young (1985a) proves that Additivity and Dummy can be replaced by Monotonicity in Shapley’s (1953) characterization. Moreover, an examination of the characterizations of the Aumann–Shapley price mechanism given by Young (1985b) and by Monderer and Neyman (1988) reveals that they employ stronger axioms than No Merging or Splitting.


                     Wang (1999) characterizes the methods satisfying Additivity and Dummy in the discrete case. Clearly, all such methods satisfy Monotonicity. In this work we prove that in the presence of No Merging or Splitting, Monotonicity implies Additivity and Dummy. The presence of No Merging or Splitting is crucial for the result. For example, Bahel and Trudeau (2013) study a more general discrete cost sharing model where any two properties among Additivity, Dummy and Monotonicity fail to imply the third.

It must be said that, like Sprumont (2005), we deal with non-decreasing cost functions, unlike Young (1985b) and Monderer and Neyman (1988), who use cost functions which are not necessarily non-decreasing. In addition, as Sprumont (2005) does, we assume that cost shares are non-negative. If we considered any cost function we would characterize the Aumann–Shapley method just requiring cost shares to be non-negative if the cost function is non-decreasing.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives preliminaries, Section 3 presents the axiomatization and the paper ends with conclusions in Section 4 and references.

                      to C an improvement in production efficiency has taken place with respect to good i. Monotonicity requires that i cannot be penalized in this case, that is, the cost share associated with i cannot increase. So if efficiency with respect to a particular agent increases, then the cost share associated with that agent cannot increase.

The continuous version of Monotonicity (together with other axioms) is employed by Young (1985b) and by Monderer and Neyman (1988) to characterize the Aumann–Shapley price mechanism. In the continuous version the first partial derivative of the cost function is employed; the one sided first partial derivative on the boundary of the domain. Notice that with both cost shares and prices Monotonicity is stated in the same way since

This axiom avoids splitting manipulations. It relates two problems with different sets of agents. An agent “splits” into different agents whose total consumption equals the consumption of the original one. So agent i splits into agents in I and consumption of i equals the consumption of agents in I. The other consumptions do not change. Accordingly the cost function does not change since the variable associated with agent i has split into the variables associated with the split agents. The sum of those variables plays the role of the variable associated with the original agent i. No Merging or Splitting requires the cost share of the original agent to be equal to the sum of the cost shares of split agents. Observe that this axiom does not impose any requirement on the cost shares of the remaining agents. Notice also that when i splits into several agents then agent i is also present. So the consumption of i is divided into several quantities and it is assumed that these quantities are associated with i and some new agents.

                     , Symmetry (prices do not depend on the names of the agents), Rescaling (if the demands are rescaled so are the prices) and Monotonicity characterize the Aumann–Shapley price mechanism. So we prove in the present paper that in the discrete case (and considering non-decreasing cost functions) Symmetry and Rescaling can be dropped. We have to say that in the discrete case demands could not be changed in scale in any way, but only with non-negative integers.

                            coincides with the Shapley value of v. Young (1985a) characterizes the Shapley value with Monotonicity and Symmetry. However in Lemma 5 we cannot apply that the cost-sharing method satisfies Symmetry. The cost-sharing method satisfies No Merging or Splitting, and therefore Weak Symmetry (Lemma 3). As its name reveals, Weak Symmetry does not imply Symmetry. Indeed, if we look at the formulation of Weak Symmetry we have that

                                 N
                              
                           . On the other hand, by No Merging or Splitting, if all the agents in N are symmetric then the agents in N have the same allocations. This can be proved applying Lemma 4, taking 
                              
                                 T
                                 =
                                 ∅
                              
                            and 
                              
                                 S

                           . And obviously this property is weaker than Symmetry.

And this is the proof of Theorem 1.
                        Proof
                        It is clear that 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       ϕ
                                    
                                    
                                       ASh
                                    
                                 
                              
                            satisfies No Merging or Splitting and Monotonicity. Conversely, let 
                              
                                 ϕ
                              
                            be a cost-sharing method that satisfies these two properties.

If cost functions which are not necessarily non-decreasing (in this case cost shares might be negative) are considered, another axiom must be added to obtain the axiomatization. It suffices to require cost shares to be non-negative if the cost function is non-decreasing. Notice that Lemma 1 holds and the rest too. Furthermore,

                           . So the proofs of Lemma 5 and Theorem 1 are also valid with the same axioms.

As mentioned in the Introduction, in this paper we show that in Sprumont (2005) Additivity and Dummy can be replaced by Monotonicity when No Merging or Splitting is present. Notice that No Merging or Splitting gives rise to a variety of results and plays a key role in the proof of Theorem 1. This axiom implies Zero Independence (Lemma 2), and moreover, Lemma 4 for symmetric agents. Zero Independence, Lemma 4 and Monotonicity imply Lemma 5, which is the start point for the induction hypothesis in the proof of Theorem 1. Finally, No Merging or Splitting allows to prove step 1 in that proof, since the cost shares of an agent can be calculated by means of cost shares of agents with lower demands. All these results and Monotonicity determine the Aumann–Shapley method.


                           Sprumont (2005) provides two variations of the axiomatization for the Aumann–Shapley method. No Merging or Splitting relates cost-sharing problems with different sets of agents. Sprumont (2005) changes this axiom in order to relate cost-sharing problems with equal sets of agents. In the second variation he let agents consume bundles of goods. We point that Additivity and Dummy can also be replaced by Monotonicity in Sprumont’s variations of his main axiomatization.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we offer an axiomatization of the Aumann–Shapley method in the discrete case by employing Monotonicity. In doing so, we fill the gap with regard to cost-sharing problems in which goods are perfectly divisible. At the same time we find that weaker axioms are needed in the discrete case. This is revealed by looking at the characterization of the Aumann–Shapley price mechanism introduced by Monderer and Neyman (1988). It is an open question whether axioms could be weakened in the latter case, especially, if Symmetry is not needed as an explicit requirement.

On the other hand, there are axiomatizations of other cost-sharing methods in the discrete case in which Additivity and Dummy are employed. For example in Sprumont (2000) and Moulin (1995). It is also an open question whether Monotonicity, possibly with other axioms, could replace the two axioms.

Another setting connected with cost-sharing problems is that of bankruptcy problems. Bergantiños and Vidal-Puga (2006) characterize a family of additive rules for discrete bankruptcy problems. It deserves further research to examine the role of the Monotonicity property for these discrete problems.
