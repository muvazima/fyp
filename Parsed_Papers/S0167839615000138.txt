                  We present a novel, deterministic, and efficient method to detect whether a given rational space curve is symmetric. By using well-known differential invariants of space curves, namely the curvature and torsion, the method is significantly faster, simpler, and more general than an earlier method addressing a similar problem (Alcázar et al., 2014b). To support this claim, we present an analysis of the arithmetic complexity of the algorithm and timings from an implementation in Sage.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The problem of detecting the symmetries of curves and surfaces has attracted the attention of many researchers throughout the years, because of the interest from fields like Pattern Recognition (Boutin, 2000; Calabi et al., 1998; Huang and Cohen, 1996; Lebmeir and Richter-Gebert, 2008; Lebmeir, 2009; Suk and Flusser, 1993, 2005; Tarel and Cooper, 2000; Taubin and Cooper, 1992; Weiss, 1993), Computer Graphics (Berner et al., 2008; Bokeloh et al., 2009; Lipman et al., 2010; Martinet et al., 2006; Mitra et al., 2006; Podolak et al., 2006; Schnabel et al., 2008; Simari et al., 2006), and Computer Vision (Alt et al., 1988; Brass and Knauer, 2004; Jiang et al., 1996; Li et al., 2008, 2010; Loy and Eklundh, 2006; Tate and Jared, 2003; Sun and Sherrah, 1997). The introduction in Alcázar et al. (2014b) contains an extensive account of the variety of approaches used in the above references.

A common characteristic in most of these papers is that the methods focus on computing approximate symmetries more than exact symmetries, which is perfectly reasonable in many applications, where curves and surfaces often serve as merely approximate representations of a more complex shape. Some exceptions appear here: If the object to be considered is discrete (e.g. a polyhedron), or is described by a discrete object, like for instance a control polygon or a control polyhedron, then the symmetries can be determined exactly (Alt et al., 1988; Brass and Knauer, 2004; Jiang et al., 1996; Li et al., 2008). Examples of the second class are Bézier curves and tensor product surfaces. Furthermore, in these cases the symmetries of the curve or surface follow from those of the underlying discrete object. Another exception appears in Lebmeir and Richter-Gebert (2008), where the authors provide a deterministic method to detect rotation symmetry of an implicitly defined algebraic plane curve and to find the exact rotation angle and rotation center. The method uses a complex representation of the curve and is generalized in Lebmeir (2009) to detect mirror symmetry as well.

Rational curves are frequently used in Computer Aided Geometric Design and are the building blocks of NURBS curves. Compared to implicit curves, rational parametric curves are easier to manipulate and visualize. Space curves appear in a natural way when intersecting two surfaces, and they play an important role when dealing with special types of surfaces, often used in geometric modeling, like ruled surfaces, canal surfaces or surfaces of revolution, which are generated from a directrix or profile curve. Furthermore, in geometric modeling it is typical to use rational space curves as profile curves.

In this paper we address the problem of deterministically finding the symmetries of a rational space curve, defined by means of a proper parametrization. Notice that since we deal with a global object, i.e., the set of all points in the image of a rational parametrization, and not just a piece of it, the discrete approach from Alt et al. (1988), Brass and Knauer (2004), Jiang et al. (1996), Li et al. (2008) is not suitable here. Determining if a rational space curve is symmetric or not is useful in order to properly describe the topology of the curve (Alcázar and Díaz Toca, 2010). Furthermore, if the space curve is to be used for generating, for instance, a canal surface or a surface of revolution, certain symmetries of the curve will be inherited by the generated surface. Hence, for modeling purposes it can be interesting to know these symmetries in advance.

Recently, the problem of determining whether a rational plane or space curve is symmetric has been addressed in Alcázar (2014), Alcázar et al. (2014a, 2014b) using a different approach. The common denominator in these papers is the following observation: If a rational curve is symmetric, i.e., invariant under a nontrivial isometry f, then this symmetry induces another parametrization of the curve, different from the original parametrization. Assuming that the initial parametrization is proper (definition below), the second parametrization is also proper. Since two proper parametrizations of the same curve are related by a Möbius transformation (Sendra et al., 2008), determining the symmetries is reduced to finding this transformation, therefore translating the problem to the parameter space. This observation leads to algorithms for determining the symmetries of plane curves with polynomial parametrizations (Alcázar, 2014) and of plane and space curves with rational parametrizations (Alcázar et al., 2014b), although in the latter case of general space curves only involutions were considered. The more general problem of determining whether two rational plane curves are similar was considered in Alcázar et al. (2014a).

In this paper we again employ the above observation, but in addition we now also use well-known differential invariants of space curves, namely the curvature and the torsion. The improvement over the method in Alcázar et al. (2014b) is threefold: First of all, we are now able to find all the symmetries of the curve instead of just the involutions. Secondly, the new algorithm is considerably faster and can efficiently handle even curves with high degrees and large coefficients in reasonable timings. Finally, the method is simpler to implement and requires fewer assumptions on the parametrization.

Some general facts on symmetries of rational curves are presented in Section 2. Section 3 provides an algorithm for checking whether a curve is symmetric. The determination of the symmetries themselves is addressed in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 we report on the performance of the algorithm, by presenting a complexity analysis and providing timings for several examples, including a comparison with the curves tested in Alcázar et al. (2014b).

                        x
                      be the maximal degree of the numerators and denominators of the components

                        )
                     . Note that rational curves are irreducible. We assume that the parametrization (1) is proper, i.e., birational or, equivalently, injective except for perhaps finitely many values of t. This can be assumed without loss of generality, since any rational curve can quickly be properly reparametrized. For these claims and other results on properness, the interested reader can consult (Sendra et al., 2008) for plane curves and (Alcázar, 2012, §3.1) for space curves.

                      is called the trivial symmetry.

The classification of the nontrivial isometries of Euclidean space includes reflections (in a plane), rotations (about an axis), and translations, and these combine in commutative pairs to form twists, glide reflections, and rotatory reflections. Composing three reflections in mutually perpendicular planes through a point 
                        p
                      yields a central inversion (also called central symmetry), with center 
                        p
                     , i.e., a symmetry with respect to the point 
                        p
                     . The particular case of rotation by an angle π is of special interest, and it is called a half-turn. Rotation symmetries are direct, while mirror and central symmetries are opposite.

Therefore, the rotations, reflections, and their combinations (like central inversions) are the only isometries leaving an irreducible algebraic space curve, different from a line, invariant. We say that an irreducible algebraic space curve is symmetric, if it is invariant under one of these (nontrivial) isometries. In that case, we distinguish between a mirror symmetry, rotation symmetry and central symmetry. If the curve is neither a line nor a circle, it has a finite number of symmetries (Alcázar et al., 2014b).

We recall the following result from Alcázar et al. (2014b). For this purpose, let us recall first that a Möbius transformation (of the affine real line) is a rational function

                         need not be rational numbers, so that we need to factor over the algebraic or real numbers. This problem has been studied by several authors (Cheeze, 2004; Cheeze and Galligo, 2006; Corless et al., 2002; Galligo and Rupprecht, 2002). However, since in our case we are looking for factors of a specific form, we develop an ad hoc method to check the condition.

                           0
                        . In the first case, we may assume 
                           d
                           =
                           1
                         by dividing all coefficients in the Möbius transformation by d. In that case

                                 ξ
                              
                           
                           :
                           =
                           x
                           ∘
                           
                              
                                 φ

                         as in Theorem 2. We thus arrive at Algorithm Symm
                        ± for determining the number of symmetries of the curve 
                           C
                        .

Algorithm Symm
                     ± detects whether the parametric curve 
                        x
                      from (1) has nontrivial symmetries. In the affirmative case we would like to determine these symmetries. By Theorem 2, every such symmetry corresponds to a Möbius transformation 
                        φ
                        =
                        (
                        a
                        t
                        +
                        b
                        )
                        /
                        (
                        c
                        t
                        +
                        d
                        )
                     , which corresponds to a Möbius-like factor F of G computed by Algorithm Symm
                     ±. In this section we shall see how the symmetry 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        )
                        =
                        
                           Q
                           x
                        
                        +
                        b
                      can be computed from φ.

                      Let us distinguish the cases

                     , and we again assume that the curvature

Let us determine the arithmetic complexity of Algorithm Symm
                        ±, i.e., the number of integer operations needed. In addition to using the standard Big O notation 
                           O
                         for the space- and time-complexity analysis, we use the Soft O notation

                         to ignore any logarithmic factors in the time-complexity analysis. The bitsize τ of an integer k is defined as 
                           τ
                           =

                        ; the bitsize of a parametrization 
                           x
                         (taken with integer coefficients) is the maximum bitsize of the coefficients of the numerators and denominators of the components. The following theorem presents the arithmetic complexity of Algorithm Symm
                        ± when applied to parametric curves of varying degree m and of fixed bitsize.

Note that resorting to probabilistic algorithms, the bivariate gcd G in Step 1 can be computed in

                         operations using the ‘small primes modular gcd algorithm’ and fast polynomial arithmetic (Von zur Gathen and Gerhard, 2003, Corollary 11.9.(i)). Thus a probabilistic version of Algorithm Symm

Algorithm Symm
                        ± was implemented in the computer algebra system Sage (Stein et al., 2013), using Singular (Decker et al., 2011) as a back-end, and was tested on a Dell XPS 15 laptop, with 2.4 GHz i5-2430M processor and 6 GB RAM. Additional technical details are provided in the Sage worksheet, which can be downloaded from the third author's website (Muntingh, personal website) and can be tried out online by visiting SageMathCloud (Alcázar et al., 2015).

We present tables with timings corresponding to different groups of examples. Table 1
                         corresponds to the set of examples in Alcázar et al. (2014b), making it possible to compare the timing

To test Algorithm Symm
                        ± for symmetric curves with higher degree, Table 2
                         lists the timings for a family of daisies of increasing degree

                        , parametrically given by (30). The algorithm quickly finds the symmetries of these symmetric curves, also for high degree.

For very large coefficient bitsizes (>256, i.e., coefficients with more than 77 digits) and high degrees (>20) the machine runs out of memory. We have therefore analyzed separately the regime with high degree and the regime with large coefficient bitsize.

                         presents log-log plots of the CPU times against the degree (left) and against the coefficient bitsizes (right). The (eventually) linear nature of these data suggests the existence of an underlying power law. Least squares approximation yields that, as a function of the degree m, the average CPU time

The reason is that in the analyzed examples almost all time is spent computing the bivariate gcd in Step 1, which then typically has low degree, so that the remaining calculations take relatively little time.

                        ± is still valid for such curves, we have observed a very poor performance in this case. The reason is that, for non-planar curves, the degree of

                        . However, for plane curves the degree of

                         is equal to the degree of K, and then the computation takes a very long time. Therefore, for plane curves, the algorithms in Alcázar et al. (2014a, 2014b) are preferable.

                         Since the degrees can get very high in this relation, this substitution can take a long time. Then the algebraic numbers β, and therefore the symmetry and Möbius transformation, are found by requiring that this relation holds identically.

Furthermore, the method described in Alcázar et al. (2014b) requires that the parametrization 
                           x
                         satisfies rather strict conditions. Quite often, a reparametrization is needed in order to achieve these conditions, which can result in destroying sparseness and increasing the coefficient size. This, in turn, has an impact on the time taken by the substitution step.

By contrast, in Algorithm Symm

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have presented a new, deterministic, and efficient method for detecting whether a rational space curve is symmetric. The method combines ideas in Alcázar (2014), Alcázar et al. (2014b) with the use of the curvature and torsion as differential invariants of space curves. The complexity analysis and experiments show a good theoretical and practical performance, clearly beating the performance obtained in Alcázar et al. (2014b). The algorithm also improves in scope on the algorithm of Alcázar et al. (2014b), which can only be applied to find the symmetries for Pythagorean-hodograph curves and involutions of other curves. Finally Algorithm Symm
                     ± is simpler than the algorithm in Alcázar et al. (2014b), which imposes certain conditions on the parametrization that often lead to a reparametrized, non-sparse curve whose coefficients have a large bitsize. By contrast, the algorithm in this paper has fewer requirements and is efficient even with high degrees.

Note that Algorithm Symm
                     ± is based on two conditions in Theorem 5, one involving the curvature and torsion of the curve and the other one involving the arc length. One might wonder whether these two conditions really are independent for the case of rational curves. We included both conditions because we did not succeed in proving that they are dependent, but neither did we find an example of a tentative Möbius transformation not satisfying Condition (11). The relation between the conditions is therefore undetermined, and we pose the question here as an open problem. In any case, in the complexity analysis and experiments we observed that the cost of checking (11) is small compared to the rest of the algorithm.

The implementation in Sage can be improved in several ways. First, several of the methods named in the complexity section are not included in Sage, which carries out the corresponding tasks by using other algorithms. Furthermore, almost all space curves are asymmetric, and these cases can be identified faster. In order to do this, one can first remove all factors

                      and 
                        
                           
                              T
                           
                           
                              x

                     , and then check whether the remaining polynomials are coprime using modular arithmetic. In the affirmative case, the conclusion that the curve has no nontrivial symmetries could be obtained at very little computational cost.

As a final remark, as this paper sets forth a method for computing exact symmetries of parametric curves with rational coefficients, one could ask whether a similar development could yield a method for computing approximate symmetries of parametric curves with floating point coefficients. This is an open question that we would like to address in the future.
