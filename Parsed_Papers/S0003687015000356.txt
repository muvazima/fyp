                  The study aimed at investigating how drivers use Adaptive Cruise Control and its functions in distinct road environments and to verify if changes occur over time. Fifteen participants were invited to drive a vehicle equipped with a Stop & Go Adaptive Cruise Control system on nine occasions. The course remained the same for each test run and included roads on urban and motorway environments. Results showed significant effect of experience for ACC usage percentage, and selection of the shortest time headway value in the urban road environment. This indicates that getting to know a system is not a homogenous process, as mastering the use of all the system's functions can take differing lengths of time in distinct road environments. Results can be used not only for the development of the new generation of systems that integrate ACC functionalities but also for determining the length of training required to operate an ACC system.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) was introduced to the market in the 90s; first in Japan (1995), then in Europe (1998) and North America (2000) as an option for some luxury vehicle models (Bishop, 2005). The system was then made available in a wider range of vehicles over subsequent years (Jagtman and Wiersma, 2003). ACC functions are expected to become increasingly more available to drivers as the costs of production decrease, and their incorporation into the next generation of systems becomes a reality. Some examples of the latter are already present in the literature: 1) Workload-Adaptive Cruise Control (WACC – Hajek et al., 2013); 2) Cooperative ACC (Güvenç et al., 2012); or 3) Eco-ACC (Hülsebusch et al., 2012). ACC was initially designed to operate on motorways. Its utilisation however in other road environments has been reported (Fancher et al., 1998). Changing ACC functions or integrating them with new ones might increase ACC usage on other roads. Knowing if, when, and how ACC is utilised in different contexts is important as the utilisation of the same system in two distinct contexts might lead to different interaction results. The same holds true for experience, as this can change the way drivers use a system. The influence of context and experience thus deserves an in-depth analysis. Consideration of their effect may diversify output with regards to road safety, whilst the varying nature of context and experience indicates that solutions for problems might not be applicable to all contexts and levels of expertise. Given that knowledge on how system functions are utilised in different road environments over time is still sparse, in our paper we aim to address this gap by presenting data on an extended ACC trial.

A considerable number of studies conducted to date are cross-sectional and analyse the interaction between manual driving and ACC (for an overview: Morsink et al., 2007). ACC has been recognized as transforming the driving task and consequently driver behaviour, as its activation no longer requires constant actions (for regulating speed and headway distance), but a large portion of monitoring (Lin et al., 2009). The usage of ACC has already been associated with less safe driving when compared with manual driving. Speed increase, especially when interacting with ACC systems that support the driver at a higher level (Morsink et al., 2007), and shorter minimum time-gap (Rajaonah et al., 2006) have been reported.

Changes in driver behaviour however do not exclusively occur immediately after the introduction of the system in the driving task. As Rudin-Brown and Parker (2004) demonstrated, they can occur after the driver has been interacting with the system for some time, indicating that drivers continue to adapt. Manser et al. (2013) theorize about the temporal factors affecting the behaviour after the introduction of a change in the road system (such as the interaction with new in-vehicle equipments). Three stages are mentioned: 1) the immediate phase, which occurs immediately after a driver experiences the change; 2) the short-term phase, occurring hours, days or weeks after the introduction of the change; and 3) the long-term phase, which transpires after months or years.

Analysing how drivers interact with the system over time provides an insight into whether the risks already observed in the immediate phase remain the same or increase. How frequently is the ACC used? Which speed ranges are set by the drivers? Which time headway is preferred? Which strategies are utilised to override the system? These are questions that, apart from typifying the nature of the interaction, can contribute to evaluating the impacts of system usage.

Positive or negative impacts on safety can be over- or under-represented dependent on how often the drivers use an in-vehicle system. The AVV Transport Research Centre in the Netherlands (as cited in Morsink et al., 2007) stated that if all cars were equipped with ACC, accident numbers could be reduced by approximately 12.9% on motorways, 3.4% on rural provincial roads, and 0.5% on urban provincial roads. In the event however that use of the systems remain discretionary, this scenario will only be realistic with high usage rates. Longitudinal studies have reported ACC usage of about 30% of the total miles travelled (Fancher et al., 1998). Similar values were given by Sanches et al. (2012), who observed that system usage increased over time (19%–25% when comparing the beginning and end of the data collection). Higher utilisation rates were stated to occur on high-speed roads (Fancher et al., 1998; Simon, 2005), whereas for built-up areas low values were presented (Simon, 2005) or associated with higher system disengagement (Larsson, 2012). However, a clearer picture on how ACC is utilised over time in different road environments is still lacking.

Associated with the usage frequency is the overriding frequency, i.e. how frequently do drivers regain full control of the vehicle. For similar systems, like conventional cruise control (CCC), constantly disengaging and resuming the system has been reported to be annoying and tiresome (Youngbin, 1997). Drivers thus might avoid performing these actions and adapt their behaviour accordingly. Additionally, Rajaonah et al. (2006) associated experience in using the system with disengagement frequency, and reported a decrease in the deactivation of the system when comparing performance of the first and second trial in a driving simulator. This aspect was also mentioned by Sanches et al. (2012), however only a tendency was reported – about a 10% decrease in the number of overriding per hour travelled.

ACC can be overridden in several ways: 1) using the switch, 2) pressing the brake pedal or 3) the accelerator pedal. The first two strategies deactivate the system permanently, and their usage was also reported to be linked with experience. Simon (2005) reported a trend towards a greater use of the switch over time and a reduction in deactivation via brake pedal. By using the third strategy (accelerator pedal), the driver makes a temporary deactivation of the system until the pedal is released. Previous settings are then resumed automatically. A similar function exists in certain in-vehicle speed limit systems: after setting a maximum speed, this can be overridden by applying maximum pressure on the accelerator pedal. Reports have indicated a lack of knowledge about, and low usage of this function on these systems (Pereira et al., 2013). Similar behaviour might be expected when using the ACC accelerator pedal overriding strategy. Furthermore, in the study from Fancher and colleagues (1998) drivers almost never overrode with the accelerator pedal. A thorough understanding of the utilisation of each overriding strategy in distinct road environments and the occurrence of changes over time is still non-existent.

The selection of speed and headway can be directly associated with the adoption of riskier or safer behaviours. Due to their importance, they have been used to characterise the differences between manual driving and ACC (e.g. Hoedemaeker and Brookhuis, 1998), and the effect of experience on the selection of these two ACC functions has already been described. Nowakowski et al. (2010) reported a trend on the way drivers used the time gap: during the first commuting trip, the longest time-gap was favoured in 52% of the time. By the third commute however, the shortest time-gap setting was selected more than 50% of the time.

Though the ACC was a system initially conceived to be mainly used on the motorway, its utilisation in other road environments has been reported. The development of the system has brought about new features, which probably encourage its usage in lower speed environments (e.g. Stop & Go – system description and evaluation of in-car display can be found by Stanton et al., 2011). Specific knowledge however on how system functions are utilised in different road environments over time is still sparse. The present study thus aimed at investigating how drivers use ACC functions on distinct roads (urban and motorway), and at verifying if changes occur over time for what Manser and colleagues (2013) described as the short-term phase. By analysing the aggregated data of both road environments, it is hypothesised that there will be (1) higher ACC usage percentage for the motorway. The comparison of time headway selection, overriding frequency and overriding strategy between road environments belong to the exploratory part of the analysis. Regarding the analysis over time (the comparison between the first and following interactions with the system), it is hypothesised that there will be (2) an increase in the usage rate accompanied by a (3) decrease in the overriding frequency, (4) a change in the overriding strategies for the switch (increase) and brake pedal (decrease), (4) an increase in the set speed values and (5) more frequent selection of the shortest headway distance along the trials.

Fifteen drivers were recruited to take part in the study (eight male, seven female). Their age ranged between 25 and 32 years (M = 28.2; SD = 1.82). All participants had possessed a driving licence for at least seven years and stated that they had driven an average of approximately 15,000 km (SD = 8094.68) in the past 12 months. All 15 subjects reported having never previously used an ACC.

The experiment was conducted using a BMW 5 Series vehicle equipped with ACC. The system was a full range ACC (with Stop & Go). As with other ACC models, the system automated the rate of engine motion by maintaining a set cruising speed. After turning it on, cruise speed was defined whilst the vehicle was in motion and could be set between 30 and 180 km/h. The driver was able to modify the speed whilst the system was active by pressing two buttons (with + and − signs). Moreover, when approaching a slower car travelling on the same lane, the system reduced the vehicle speed. In that case, the headway distance defined by the driver (or set by default in case the driver did not interact with this function interface) was maintained. Four headway distance possibilities could be chosen: TH1 (the shortest headway); TH2; TH3 (set by default upon activation); and TH4 (the longest headway).

This ACC differed from other models as the Stop & Go function allowed the system to be active when travelling with speeds below 30 km/h. This means that when following a slower car, speed was adjusted and the selected headway maintained, until the vehicle came to a standstill. Once stopped, resuming movement could be achieved using one of two possibilities: 1) for a standstill shorter than 3 s, the ego-car simply followed the vehicle ahead, without the need of any action from the driver; the set headway distance was thus maintained; 2) for longer standstill periods, the driver had to briefly press the accelerator pedal.

Once active, the system could be deactivated by pressing the brake pedal or the on/off switch. Depressing the accelerator pedal also overrode the system, but in this case, the system was temporarily deactivated until the pedal was released. Following this, the previous speed and time headway settings were resumed automatically.

The system interface was located on the left-hand side of the steering wheel and comprised an on/off switch, resume button, levers to change the set speed and buttons to change the set headway distance. Visual feedback on the system status was provided in the control panel located behind the steering wheel. When the system reached its limits (e.g.: inability to automatically brake when the deceleration of the leading vehicle became too strong), a warning sound was emitted.

The DAS included four cameras (ECOLINE digital surveillance camera with 1/3″ Sony Super HAD) connected to a central computer (Fusion Systems Driver Observer). The following images were captured: 1) face of the driver; 2) pedals; 3) ACC display on the control panel; 4) road ahead. The recording frequency was 50 Hz. Additionally, a GPS sensor was installed with 1 Hz recording frequency. This was a built-in sensor from the Smarty BX 1000 Plus camera (from D-TEG), of which the videos were not used for the analysis described in this paper.

This controlled on-road study (for an overview of on-road study categories see Carsten et al., 2013), featured a repeated-measures design as participants drove the vehicle equipped with an ACC repeatedly over a period of two months. Two independent variables were analysed: 1) experience, as participants drove the same course nine times with the system; 2) road type, as subjects drove in different road environments. Four dependent variables were analysed, which represented the activation of the system and the utilization of the main functions. They comprised: usage rate, set speed, set time headway and system deactivation.

To allow for valid comparisons among sessions and participants, the driven course remained the same in all trials. The route was approximately 37 km long and consisted of three different road types. The outward journey was composed of approximately 2.5 km of road in an urban environment (speed limit of 50 km/h), followed by 5.0 km of arterial road (speed limit of 70 km/h), and then 11 km of motorway (without speed limit). The return journey was identical. To ensure that all participants completed the exact same route, a built-in navigation system was used.

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

Participants completed a total of 10 driving sessions. The first session (a training session) lasted approximately 90 min; the other nine were of a duration no longer than 60 min. In the training session, details concerning the experiment's procedure, ethical and safety information were given. Prior to data collection, a written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Participants then drove the car without using the ACC to familiarise themselves with the vehicle, the route and the navigation instructions. An experimenter accompanied them during the first trial to help if required. At the end of the training session, participants received an excerpt of the vehicle instruction manual, containing an overview of the cockpit and instructions for the utilisation of the ACC.

Before starting the driving trial in the second session (the first trial with ACC), drivers were instructed to use the ACC system whenever they wanted. They performed the trial alone and decided independently when they felt safe and comfortable to use the ACC. Due to safety and ethical reasons, the ACC functionalities and interface were explained to all participants prior to the first interaction. For the following eight sessions with ACC, no further explanations were provided. After each driving trial subjects were debriefed.

Data was acquired through video annotation as all changes in the system status could be observed via the display. The video analysis was carried out manually using the program ELAN (Eudico Linguistic Annotator). The resulting annotations were synchronised with the GPS data (the position and speed) and integrated in a database. Due to technical and logistical problems, some trials were not included in the analysis. A total of 128 trials were available to be analysed.

As datasets contained missing data, imputation was chosen instead of listwise deletion for performing statistical analysis over time. Before performing imputation, missing completely at random (MCAR) assumption was verified with Little's MCAR test (Little, 1998; Heitjan and Basu, 1996). After proving this assumption, multiple linear regression estimates, which utilise information already existing in the dataset, was applied due to sample size.

To check for significant differences, factorial repeated-measures ANOVA were computed. Contrasts were then calculated to confirm if the hypotheses were verified, and post-hoc tests revealed the differences among conditions for an explorative analysis. An alpha level of .05 was used for all statistical tests.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The results focus exclusively on urban and motorway sections. The arterial road was not considered for analysis because road works produced changes in the road environment (mainly road layout and speed limit) during the study period. Valid comparisons among trials and participants would not have been possible for this road type.

Four variables are presented: usage rate; set speed; set time headway; and overriding. For the analysis of the first variable, the datasets of the 15 subjects were utilised. Data revealed that in urban sections, two subjects used the ACC only in one of the nine trials. Single imputation using regression was considered inappropriate for these two subjects, as missing values represented almost 90% for each case. Both subjects were therefore removed from the analyses of set speed, set time headway and overriding. These variables were then computed using a dataset with 13 subjects.

This variable indicates the percentage of kilometres driven while ACC was active. As featured in Fig. 1
                        , the number of km driven on the motorway with ACC always remained higher in all trials (motorway: M = 78.3%; urban road: M = 50.0%).

Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that no main effect of experience occurred (F(3.26, 45.7) = 2.23, p = .093, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .14). However, when taking into account exclusively the urban environment, an effect of experience is verified (F(8, 112) = 3.05, p = .004, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .18). Contrasts showed a significant difference between the first and the second trial (F(1, 14) = 13.34, p = .003, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .44), and between the first and the fifth and following trials (respectively, fifth trial F(1, 14) = 7.38, p = .017, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .35; sixth trial F(1, 14) = 10.59, p = .006, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .43; seventh trial F(1, 14) = 17.85, p = .001, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .56; eighth trial F(1, 14) = 18.94, p = .001, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .57; ninth trial F(1, 14) = 10.12, p = .007, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .42).

A main effect of road environment was also registered (F(1, 14) = 24.00, p < .001, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .63). This means that participants used the ACC system to a larger proportion when driving on the motorway. When combining both independent variables, a significant interaction effect was also revealed (F(8, 112) = 2.34, p = .023, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .14). The difference in percentage usage between motorway and urban environment is significantly larger in the first trial when compared to the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth trials (sixth: F(1, 14) = 5.39, p = .036, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .28; seventh: F(1, 14) = 8.58, p = .011, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .38; eighth: F(1, 14) = 11.30, p = .005, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .45; ninth: F(1, 14) = 5.82, p = .030, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .30).

The average of the set speed values were calculated for both road types. Considering all trials, the average set speed was 56.8 km/h on the urban road, and 157.0 km/h on the motorway.

As Fig. 2
                         shows, no major differences were registered between the trials. No significant effects were registered for the urban road (F(2.65, 31.8) = 1.47, p = .24, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .11), or for the motorway (F(3.09, 37.1) = 1.14, p = .346, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .087).

The selected time headway was defined by the proportion of kilometres each of the four possible headway values were active (TH1 to TH4; TH1 representing the shortest headway distance).

For the urban environment, and as Fig. 3
                         demonstrates, TH3 was the most utilised distance in the first four trials, being replaced by TH1 or TH2 for the remaining trials. The longest time headway (TH4) was the least utilised over the entire experiment. Analysis of variance revealed a main effect of time headway (F(1.84, 22.1) = 5.91, p = .010, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .33) and post-hoc tests exposed that TH4 was significantly less activated compared to all the other levels (TH4 and TH1: p = .011; TH4 and TH2: p = .002; TH4 and TH3: p = .001). The analysis of each TH curve over time revealed an effect of experience for the shortest time headway (TH1: F(8, 96) = 4.11, p < .001, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .25). Significant differences emerged between the first and three other trials: the fifth trial (F(1, 12) = 7.54, p = .018, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .39), the seventh (F(1, 12) = 7.42, p = .038, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .31) and the ninth (F(1, 12) = 5.02, p = .045, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .30). Regarding the TH3, although a decreasing tendency was shown (especially when considering the third to the ninth trial), no significant experience effect can be reported (F(8, 96) = 1.99, p = .056, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .14). An interaction effect exists between the variables experience and time headway (F(24, 288) = 2.10, p = .002, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .15). By using contrasts to compare the first trial with the following ones, TH1 and TH3 were the two curves showing the greatest significant differences. This means that experience influenced the way drivers selected the TH, mainly for the TH1 and TH3 settings. This difference was revealed from the fifth trial onwards for all trials excluding the eighth drive. Results on the interaction between experience and TH are shown in Table 1
                        .

For the motorway, Fig. 3 also shows that TH3 was the most utilised distance only in the first trial, while TH2 and TH1 obtained the higher values from the second trial onwards. Again, the longest time headway (TH4) was the least utilised in all nine trials. Only a tendency however was verified for the main effect of time headway (F(1.83, 22.1) = 3.32, p = .058, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .22). The analysis of each of the TH curves over time revealed only tendencies. Together, TH1 and TH2 showed an increasing trend and TH3 a decreasing one. However, no significant effect of experience was registered.

The analysis of system overriding indicated the number of overriding per kilometre driven with ACC active. The calculations included firstly overriding in general, and then per overriding strategy. Considering general overriding (showed in Fig. 4
                        ), aggregated data revealed a main effect of road (F(1, 12) = 294.10, p < .001, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .96) which indicates higher overriding frequency for the urban environment (M = 2.6) compared to the motorway (M = .35). Neither main effect of experience nor interaction effect was registered. Considering each of the overriding curves per road environment, a tendency could be seen when comparing the first and the last trial for the urban environment. However, no significant results occurred over time for any of the environments.

For analysing the overriding strategies, each road environment was considered separately (see Fig. 5
                        ).

For the urban road, results showed no main effect of experience (F(3.68, 44.3) = 2.16, p = .095, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .16), but an effect of overriding strategy (F(2, 24) = 78.88, p < .001, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .87). Post-hoc tests reveal that the system was overridden using the brake pedal significantly more often than using the accelerator pedal (p < .001), and using the switch was significantly less frequent than using either of the pedals (accelerator: p < .001; brake: p < .001). No effect of experience was registered for any of the overriding strategies.

For the motorway analysis, results revealed no main effect of experience (F(2.41, 29.00) = .74, p = .51, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .058). A main effect of overriding strategy was present (F(2, 24) = 9.89, p = .001, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .45), with post-hoc tests indicating a statistically significant difference between the switch and both pedal strategies (accelerator: p = .010; brake: p = .001). No difference was registered between both pedal use (p > .999). Similarly, there was no interaction effect between experience and overriding strategy (F(16, 192) = 1.39, p = .153, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .10).

Considering the aggregated data for the overriding strategy in both road environments, results showed an interaction effect between overriding strategy and road environment (F(1.30, 15.6) = 17.72, p < .001, η
                        
                           p
                        
                        2 = .60), meaning that the road type had an influence on the overriding strategy selection. In fact, the number of overriding per kilometre using the brake pedal was higher in the urban environment (brake pedal M = 7.00; accelerator pedal M = 3.65), whereas on the motorway, although aggregated data revealed a slightly higher utilisation of the accelerator pedal, the values for both pedals did not significantly differ (brake pedal M = 2.71; accelerator pedal M = 3.29).

An in-depth analysis into the reasons for overriding the system was performed. For each overriding moment where the brake pedal or the on/off switch was used, the manoeuvres of the ego-car and of the other vehicles in the surroundings were coded with a descriptive label. Table 2
                         presents the results for each overriding strategy per road environment. A total of 770 moments were coded, however only 714 manoeuvres are presented in the table. The label “unknown” was attributed to 56 situations, as neither the ego-car nor the other vehicle performed an action that could establish the likely reason for the ACC overriding.

In the urban environment, a wider spectrum of manoeuvres linked with overriding by using the brake pedal or the on/off switch were identified. The highest percentages were for stopping at a traffic light with no vehicle ahead and approaching an already stopped vehicle; two situations that cannot be handled by the system. On the motorway, half of the overriding situations (accounting for both overriding strategies) were performed to exit the main road. The highest utilisation of the on/off switch was carried out for this particular manoeuvre. Changing lanes was more represented as a potential reason for overriding the system on the motorway than in the urban road.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In the present paper, we presented findings on how drivers use ACC functions on distinct road environments (urban and motorway) and if changes in behaviour occur over time. Considering the spectrum of possible changes in behaviour that can happen from the moment a driver first interacts with an ACC, the findings of this work belong exclusively to what Manser et al. (2013) characterized as the short-term phase (occurring hours, days or weeks after starting to interact with the in-vehicle system).

With regard to the ACC usage rate, the hypothesised increase in usage percentage along the trials was partially confirmed. A significant increase was observed only for the urban road, leading to the conclusion that ACC usage might have distinct patterns over time in different road environments. This adds to the findings presented by Sanches et al. (2012) of general increase in usage over time, when not accounting for the road type.


                     Hoedemaeker (2000) stated that caution has to be taken with the introduction of ACC to road types other than the motorway. As the system was originally conceived to be used on motorways, safety concerns can be raised due to its utilisation in other contexts. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that the studied system was a Stop & Go ACC, which allows the system to be active for speeds below 30 km/h. Results on urban road might have been due to this characteristic. Such functionality can thus increase the utilisation of ACC in the urban context; an aspect that can only be observed after the first utilisations. This means that positive and negative impacts of the system on road safety can be enhanced due to usage of the system in environments other than the motorway. These findings have implications for the design of future studies. Further analysis should confirm if Stop & Go ACC induces higher utilisation rates on urban roads. Furthermore, it should be verified if the already reported negative consequences of ACC utilisation on high-speed roads, e.g. more ‘‘off-road” glances (Thompson et al., 2006), delayed driver reactions (Vollrath et al., 2011) and increased risk of collision in critical situations (Bianchi Piccinini et al., 2015), hold true for urban environments.

The set speed did not show the expected increasing values along the trials. Results showed that the average set speed values can be considered, in general, high both for the motorway, where no speed limit was present, and the urban road, where the limit was 50 km/h. The absence of changes along the trials can be in part explained by the high values registered from the first trials onwards. These values were either close to the limits of system activation – for the motorway – or the legal limit – for the urban road. This might indicate a fast skill acquisition for the interaction with this function. Another noteworthy aspect is that averages for the set speed on urban roads were above the legal limit. This behaviour may have arisen due to the same factors in play when driving manually, e.g. unawareness of the legal speed limit, or reliance on the tolerance threshold of the implemented speed control systems. In any case, this has implications for the design of a new generation of systems, e.g. systems that combine the functionalities of ACC with an Intelligent Speed Adaptation system (ISA – a system able to implement an action, by sending information or automatically correcting the speed, whenever the vehicle is about to surpass the local speed limit). Positive consequences are expected if drivers are informed about the speed limit, or alternatively, if drivers are prevented from setting higher values than the legal limit. However, as limiting functions result in more negative opinions (as already demonstrated by Lheureux et al., 2006), in the event that systems are discretionary, solutions need to be considered to avoid reduced acceptance leading to lower usage rates.

The hypothesised increase in the usage of the shortest headway distance along the trials was partially confirmed, as a significant increase was observed only for the urban road. Here, the influence of experience was particularly important for the selection of the default headway (TH3) and the shortest one (TH1), as they practically swapped places on the usage ranking. The default headway was most favoured in the first four trials, while the shortest one assumed primacy for almost all the subsequent trials. Also for the urban road, the longest time headway was significantly less utilised than any of the others. Nowakowski et al. (2010) had previously reported a trend in the way drivers used the time gap, showing a change between the first and third trials. Our findings confirm the existence of changes in headway selection over time, but add that changes were not observed in both road environments. These findings indicate that different headway usage patterns might occur in distinct road environments.

The importance of default settings was also highlighted. Before knowing how to operate the system in a specific environment, drivers may rely on default settings for initial usage. This suggests that default settings may be more important at certain moments (context and experience dependent). An appreciation of this has implications for the design of future systems and it would help shape the, currently in development, concept of autonomous driving. These results can help answer the still unresolved question, “What characterizes comfortable driving when using systems that automate the driving task?” Driverless cars that know how to reproduce the parameters of comfortable driving and adjust to the driver preferences (given his/her experience with such technology and the road environment) have a much better chance of being considered safe.

Regarding the ACC general overriding percentage, results revealed no significant changes over time. The hypothesised decrease in overriding frequency was not confirmed for either of the road environments, i.e. taking over the control of the vehicle assumed a similar pattern along the trips. Lower overriding frequency was observed for the motorway; a finding that can be explained by the nature of the road environment (e.g. less intersections and pedestrian crossings).

When considering the overriding strategies separately, it is important to remember that two distinct reasons are behind their usage: the accelerator pedal is activated for surpassing the set speed; the brake pedal and on/off switch to deactivate permanently the system. As results were dependent on the number of situations the driver encountered, interpreting the results of this variable should take into account the following premises: 1) when comparing the brake pedal and on/off switch utilisation, results can be interpreted as a preference of the driver between the two deactivation possibilities; 2) comparing the results of the accelerator pedal overriding strategy with the other two strategies should not be exclusively interpreted as a preference of the user, but primarily situation dependent. In any case, both comparisons are important for characterising the system utilisation in each road environment.

The overriding strategy analysis showed no significant changes in behaviour along the trials for any of the three strategies. Kopf and Simon (2001) suggested that deactivating the system via the on/off switch might increase with time, as the driver's ability to predict situations improves. In the present results, no trend towards a greater use of the switch along the trials was observed. This indicates that for the majority of the moments when system usage was considered inadequate, using the switch did not represent the most advantageous strategy in either of the road environments, neither at the beginning nor at the end of the study. This could also be observed when analysing the vehicle manoeuvres in conjunction with system disengagement, as using the on/off switch was never represented with the highest frequency. Results showed that the highest utilisation of the switch was achieved before drivers exited the main road. Though it represents only one tenth of the total deactivations on the motorway, a pattern for its utilisation can be suggested. The switch may be favoured more in situations where the driver can timely predict the need to take over vehicle control. This concurs with part of Kopf and Simon's (2001) statement regarding the ability to predict situations for ACC usage. The reason why it did not change over time in the present experiment was most likely due to methodological differences in both studies: in the present experiment the drivers were made aware from the beginning (the first trial) which exits they would have to take.

The values for overriding using the accelerator pedal are a noteworthy result. Overriding with the accelerator pedal denotes a different intention than using the brake or switch. By overriding with the accelerator, drivers regain control of the vehicle (e.g. to increase the speed and overtake a vehicle), accepting that at the end of the manoeuvre the system will be activated automatically upon pedal release. As reducing the speed is regarded as a compensation strategy to lower the complexity of the situation and increase the margins for error (Horberry et al., 2006), the activation of the accelerator to surpass the speed maintained by the system is a sign that the complexity of the situation was evaluated by the drivers as lower than their capacities to deal with it. This might support the idea that drivers quickly understood and mastered this overriding function in both environments. The low usage of a similar function on speed limit systems (Pereira et al., 2013) was not replicated in the present study. These findings raise a further research question that may have implications for the development of similar functions in new systems: how should an overriding function with the accelerator be implemented so that drivers feel safe to use it?

The results show that the road environment played an essential role in the study, as significant differences occurring in the urban environment were not mirrored on the motorway. Although some tendencies were reported on the motorway, results revealed no significant changes in any of the variables. The fact that a similar behaviour was maintained during the entire study might indicate that drivers rapidly found out how to utilize the system's functions. The modus operandi for the motorway was most likely mastered in the first trial, and then used for all later interactions with the system. Weinberger et al. (2001) stated that great progress in the ability to operate the ACC was achieved in their study in the initial two weeks. This ability included not only the operation of the controls of the ACC and its specific display elements, but it also encompassed awareness of system limitations and adequate timing for taking over vehicle control. Simon and Kopf (as cited in Simon, 2005) stated that system functions are learned relatively fast, whereas system limits might take longer as they are dependent on experience. Taking into account these works, and the fact that the analysis focused on the main functionalities of the system, the inexistence of changes over time could imply a rapid skill acquisition on the motorway. Furthermore, this rapid acquisition may have been accelerated by the fact that drivers received explanations about the system functionality and interface (in addition to the users' manual) prior to interacting with the ACC.

On the urban road, participants adopted different behaviour at the beginning and end of the study which might indicate that the distinct complexity of the road (in terms of interaction with other users and layout), may have been a decisive variable for the occurrence of changes in behaviour. The lower ACC usage rate and reduced utilisation of the shortest time headway can be regarded as a more cautious behaviour in the first trials for the urban environment. An important finding is also the moment changes occurred. The fifth trial seemed to be the moment in which the behaviour changed in a significant way for these two variables. In kilometres, this threshold point was at approximately 25 km after the first interaction with an ACC. This has implications for defining the length of the training required for mastering such functions in urban environments. A minimum of 25 km driving experience seems to be necessary.

Before concluding, it is important to mention the study limitations. Given that the experiment was designed to collect changes in behaviour occurring hours, days or weeks after initially interacting with the ACC, the experimental design makes it impossible to extrapolate the outcomes of other moments of interaction with the system. Thus, results should be exclusively applied to this specific phase. The experimental settings could also have had further impacts on the results. Though there was no obligation to use the system, the non-naturalistic environment may have played a role in ACC usage rate and influenced the absolute values of this variable. Additionally, the limited sample size may have prevented the identification of other significant differences in behaviour; a consideration that should be improved in further studies. A deeper knowledge concerning the way drivers interact with the ACC can be gained if the results of the present study are augmented with an investigation into other parameters such as drivers' mental model, trust, acceptance or risk perception.

In sum, the present work revealed that when considering the way drivers use the ACC functions, changes in behaviour can occur after the integration of the system into the driving task. However, the existence of changes might be dependent on the road environment. Furthermore, learning to operate the system functions was not a homogenous process, as the timing for mastering each function slightly differed. In any case, this process could be completed in a few trials. As discussed in the paper, these findings can be used to frame follow-on studies on the utilisation of ACC on urban roads, for the design of the next generation of systems that integrate ACC functionalities and that have higher levels of automation, and lastly for defining the length of training required.
