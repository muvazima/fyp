                  Background and objective
                  Studies on traumatic injuries of children indicate that impact to the head is a major cause of severe injury and high mortality. However, regulatory and ethical concerns very much limit development and validation of computer models representing the pediatric head. The purpose of this study was to develop a child head finite element model with high-biofidelity to be used for studying pediatric head injury mechanisms.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A newly developed 10-year-old (YO) pediatric finite element head model was limitedly validated for kinematic and kinetic responses against data from quasi-static compressions and drop tests obtained from an experimental study involving a child-cadaver specimen. The validated model was subsequently used for a fall accident reconstruction and associated injury analysis.
               
               
                  Results
                  The model predicted the same shape of acceleration–time histories as was found in drop tests with the largest discrepancy of −8.2% in the peak acceleration at a drop height of 15 cm. Force–deflection responses predicted by the model for compression loading had a maximum discrepancy of 7.5% at a strain rate of 0.3 s−1. The model-predicted maximum von Mises stress (σv) and principal strain (εp) in the skull, intracranial pressure (ICP), maximum σv and maximum εp in the brain, head injury criterion (HIC), brain injury criterion (BrIC), and head impact power (HIP) were used for analyzing risks of injury in the accident reconstruction.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Based on the results of the injury analyses, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) ICP cannot be used to accurately predict the locations of brain injury, but it may reflect the overall energy level of the impact event. (2) The brain regions predicted by the model to have high σv coincide with the locations of subdural hematoma with transtentorial herniation and the impact position of an actual injury. (3) The brain regions with high εp predicted by the model coincide with locations commonly found where diffuse axonal injuries (DAI) due to blunt-impact and rapid acceleration have taken place.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Traumatic head injury has become one of the most severe threats to children's lives, due to its high incidence and fatality rate. In the U.S., approximately 19% of all traumatic pediatric deaths result from head injury [1], as do approximately 75% of trauma-related hospitalizations of children [2]. Early-age head injuries may lead to mental problems that can last for a lifetime, and this brings heavy burdens to families and society. Additionally, it has been reported that at similar impact loading conditions, children will sustain more severe injury outcomes than adults [3]. Therefore, studies on pediatric head injury mechanisms and corresponding protective means have been popular in recent years.

Mechanisms of injury for children's heads are different from those of adults, and information for adequate description of these differences has been insufficiently available and difficult to obtain. While a number of studies using cadaveric tests and computer simulations have been conducted to elucidate mechanisms of injury in adult heads subjected to falls, impacts, and blast waves [4–10], ethical concerns have limited the availability of child-cadaver specimens for the same types of tests. In the available literature published since 1980, there have been only six experimental studies on the mechanical responses of pediatric heads. Included in these studies are tests conducted by McPherson and Kriewall [11], Margulies and Thibault [12], and Davis et al. [13], which focused on the properties of pediatric cranial bones, and tests by Weber [14,15], Prange et al. [16], and Loyd [17], which focused on overall head responses.

Despite difficulties in obtaining sufficient numbers of cadaveric specimens of children, great progress has been made in the development of numerical models of pediatric heads representing children of many ages. To date, a number of reports have been published regarding models representing heads of infants and children from 0 to 3 years of age. For example, Klinich et al. [18] built a finite element model (FEM) representing the head of a 6-month-old (MO) infant. This model was used for investigation of skull injuries incurred during usage of backward child-restraint systems. To study brain injuries due to shaking, falling, and impact, Roth et al. [19–21] developed a series of FEMs for children 17 days, 6 months, and 3 years of age. Li et al. [22] used principal component analysis and regression analysis to establish parameterized geometric models representing the heads of newborn, 1.5-MO, and 3-MO infants. These models could be applied in studies of accident reconstructions. The same authors developed a model representing the head of a 6-MO to analyze young children's injuries due to falls [23].

Mizuno et al. [24] constructed a 3-year-old (YO) full-body FE model with a rigid head by scaling the 50th percentile-adult model of the Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS). Using CT images, Ruan et al. [25] developed a 6-YO, full-body model that included a head with anatomical details. To the best of our knowledge, no head models for 9- to 15-YOs are available. Within this age range, the sizes of the heads of 12- to 15-YO children are similar to those of fifth-percentile females. Thus, 12- to 15-YO pediatric heads can be approximated by using the fifth-percentile female model, such as the THUMS 5th percentile female model and the female model being developed by the Global Human Body Modeling Consortium (GHBMC).

Heads for 9- to 11-YO children cannot be replaced by heads of children of other ages nor of adults. Furthermore, 9- to 11-YO children have higher chances of injury during traffic accidents. Knowledge of this higher incidence has resulted in particular regulations regarding testing and protective means for this age group [26]. Therefore, there is a great need for a high-biofidelity head model representing 9- to 11-YO children.

To improve the safety of children in the aforementioned age range, Wayne State University (WSU), under a financial sponsorship of Toyota Motor Corporation, developed a high quality, 10-YO full-body FEM, which was named Collaborative Human Advanced Research Model-10 YO (CHARM-10). Models for some of the main body parts, such as the neck, chest, and extremities, have been validated [26–28]. However, validation for the head model remains incomplete. In this study, the mechanical responses of the CHARM-10 head FEM were validated against results obtained from compression and drop tests on cadaveric specimens in the age range of 9 to 10 years. Additional analyses were conducted regarding injuries predicted by the model in drop-loading conditions.

@&#METHODS@&#

The CHARM-10 head model used in this study was based on the model originally developed at WSU [29–31]. The dimensions of the head (perimeter, length, width, height, and brain volume) were compared with statistical data reported by Dekaban [32] as shown in Table 1
                        . From this table, one can see that the key dimensions of the model closely match Dekaban's data. The largest discrepancy is in the head width, where the difference is 2%. Such a slight discrepancy demonstrates that the model can well represent the geometric features of a 10-YO child.

A multi-block approach, achieved through an edge projection method, was used for the original model developed at WSU. The curved contours of brain surfaces observed in clinical images were simplified with flat surfaces formed by grid lines, as shown in Fig. 1
                        (a). The mesh generated from these grids, shown in Fig. 1(b), has the same flat surfaces as observed in the blocks. The current study is based on an approach reported by Mao et al. [33]. An ANSYS ICEM CFD/HEXA12.0 (ANSYS, Canonsburg, PA) was used to accurately project an external mesh to conform with surface contours obtained clinically [Fig. 1(c)]. In addition, the internal mesh within each block was adjusted to ensure that the quality of the mesh was improved.

The updated CHARM-10 pediatric head model is illustrated in Fig. 2
                        . The anatomic features include the scalp, cranial bones, facial skull, jaw, tentorium, dura mater, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pia mater, cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and corpus callosum. The interface between the brain and the skull was simulated by using sharing nodes to directly connect the exterior surface of the CSF to the dura mater and the internal surface of the CSF to the pia mater. The model consists of 185,109 nodes, 23,343 shell elements, and 175,007 hexahedral solid elements. The parameters on the mesh quality are summarized in Table 2
                        .

The geometric profile of the head model was based on CT and MRI data of patients, around 10 years of age, from Michigan Children's Hospital [31]. The resolution of the images taken for medical diagnostic purposes was relatively low. Consequently, it was impossible to accurately separate trabecular (diploe) from cortical (outer and inner tables) layers of the skull. Additionally, no studies on thicknesses of cortical or diploe layers of pediatric skulls have been reported in the literature. Furthermore, high resolution CT scans on pediatric volunteers could not be conducted, due to ethical concerns, and sufficient cadaveric skull samples could not be secured to conduct micro CT scans to fulfill the goal of identifying the average thicknesses of individual layers. Because of these problems, it was decided to maintain a three-layer skull in the model for the current study. It is anticipated that future studies will reveal thicknesses and material properties of the outer table, diploe, and inner table. At this stage, the three-layer skull was simulated as a composite structure (i.e., without distinction of trabecular and cortical bone) with the same material properties assumed for all three layers. This approach was based on the work reported by Hubbard [34] who applied layered beam theory to the study of layered cranial bones. He found from the response of layered cranial bone that it could be reproduced by a single structure with a homogeneous material and the same exterior geometry as the layered structure. This method has also been utilized by Ward et al. [35] and Claessens et al. [36].

An elastic-plastic material (*MAT_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY model, MAT 24) available in LS-DYNA (LSTC, Livermore, CA) was used to simulate the mechanical behavior of the skull. No literature is available regarding mechanical testing on 10-YO pediatric skulls. However, in two studies, testing was performed on 6-YO skulls (one per study). These two studies were reviewed to obtain properties that could be used for the 10-YO pediatric skull [11,13]. Using 3-point bending tests on 12 cortical bone samples from a 6-YO child, McPherson and Kriewall [11] determined that the Young's modulus of the 6-YO cortical bone was 7.1 GPa. Davis et al. [13] performed 4-point bending tests on 17 cortical-trabecular composite bone samples from a 6-YO child and concluded that the “composite” Young's modulus of the 6-YO skull was 3.69 GPa. Because the current study also used a “composite” approach, the result reported by Davis et al. [13] was selected for scaling. Irwin and Mertz [37] reported a ratio of 1.268 for scaling the Young's modulus from a 6-YO to a 10-YO skull. Based on these two studies, the resulting Young's modulus for the 10-YO was calculated to be 4.68 GPa.

No information is available regarding the specific tangent modulus for the 10 YO. However, Currey and Butler [38] tested the plastic behavior of the bones at different ages and suggested that the tangent modulus did not change significantly with age. Therefore, in the current model, the tangent modulus used for adults was adopted [33].

To date, no literature is available concerning mechanical testing of 10-YO human brain tissues. The only study based on testing pediatric brain tissue focused on infants and toddlers aged 2 to 23 months [39]. Other studies related to age-dependent material properties of brain tissues were conducted on animal specimens [40–43]. Thibault and Margulies [41] reported data from experiments using porcine specimens that were 2 to 3 days old. These data have been incorporated into some FEMs, such as those developed by Klinich et al. [18] and Roth et al. [19], to represent 6-MO infant heads. However, properties of animals are different from those of children at different developmental stages [26], and therefore use of tissue properties attained from animals is not fully accurate. Additionally, in the study reported by Thibault and Margulies [41], the porcine data exhibited very low shear relaxation behavior. This behavior may not be suitable for transient dynamics simulations. In a number of published head FEMs [21,25,33], material parameters of brain tissues have been assumed to be the same as those used to represent adult brains. Therefore, the material properties from a validated FEM of the adult head [33] were used for the current FEM of the child head. A viscoelastic material model (*MAT_KELVIN-MAXWELL_VISCOELASTIC model, MAT 61) was used to model the brain tissue (cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The shear relaxation behavior in this viscoelastic material model is expressed in Equation 1:

                         is the long-term shear modulus, β is a decay constant, and t is the time duration.

The membrane structures including the falx, dura mater, and tentorium were modeled by an elastic or elastic-plastic material. Material properties selected for the final FEM of the 10-YO child's head are shown in Table 3
                        .

Weber [14,15], Prange et al. [16], and Loyd [17] used pediatric cadavers to study overall head responses. Studies reported by Weber [14,15] and Prange et al. [16] used infant specimens that were less than one year old, and hence these data were not suitable for validating the current model. Loyd [17] reported experimental test results collected during drop and compressive loading on unembalmed cadaver heads from neonate to adult. For the age group from 9 to 11 years, only one set of data was obtained, and this was from a 9-YO child cadaver. In consideration of age similarity for the current study, the experimental data obtained from tests on this 9-YO cadaver were used to validate the 10-YO FE head model. In the drop tests reported by Loyd [17], the heads were released from heights of 15 and 30 cm, and were dropped to a flat aluminum surface. The orientations of the drops of the heads to the plate were set as vertical drops with the forehead, occipital, crown, or parietal region facing downward. During the tests, force–time histories of the impact were recorded. In the compression tests, the head was placed between two rigid plates. The lower plate was fixed, and the upper plate moved downward to apply a load. The tests were performed in the right-to-left (R–L) direction with respect to the face, and the compressive force–deflection responses were measured.

The tests reported by Loyd [17] were simulated using the newly updated FEM representing the 10-YO head. In the drop test simulations, the head was assigned with an initial velocity, where the magnitude was determined based on the drop height. The head dropped at 15 cm had an initial velocity of 1.71 m/s, while the head dropped from 30 cm started at 2.42 m/s. In the compression-test simulation, the focus was placed on the R–L direction. Compression velocities were determined based on experimental strain rates (i.e., 0.0005, 0.001, 0.1, and 0.3 s−1) and head sizes. All of the simulations were conducted using LS-DYNA (version 971 R4.2). A surface-to-surface contact with a friction coefficient 0.2 was used to model interaction between the head and the plate. The hourglass energy, a measure of how much energy was used to stabilize the model behaviors, was less than 5% of the internal energy at any stage of the simulation. This low hourglass to internal energy ratio indicated that the simulations were numerically stable.

The study chosen for the accident reconstruction was reported by Plunkett [44]. It involved a 10-YO child who fell backward from a swing, at a height estimated to be between 0.9 and 1.5 m, to a concrete ground. The back side of the head contacted the ground. According to the medical report [44], the child had lost consciousness by the time of the initial evaluation and displayed decerebrate posturing after arriving at the hospital. Additionally, a large, acute, right fronto-parietal subdural hematoma with transtentorial herniation without calvarial fracture was diagnosed from CT scans. Although this hematoma was surgically removed, the child developed a malignant cerebral edema and died 6 days later. A postmortem examination revealed a right parietal subarachnoid artery malformation, contiguous with a small residual subdural hemorrhage.

In the present study, a 10-YO multi-body model was used to reconstruct the fall, and the 10-YO FEM was used to analyze the injuries based on kinematics obtained from the multi-body model. First, the software package MADYMO (7.4.1, TNO, Rijswijk, Netherlands) was applied to obtain kinematic data representing the falling event. The 10-YO multi-body model, integrated in MADYMO, was set to drop from heights of 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 m, and the corresponding velocities and impact orientations were obtained at the initial time the head contacted the ground. The impact velocities calculated in the MADYMO model are listed in Table 4
                        . Second, using the contact velocities predicted by the MADYMO model and impact directions of the head as the initial conditions, new simulations were conducted with the 10-YO head FEM. Consistent with an assumption reported by Ruan et al. [45], a free boundary condition was assumed for these new simulations. The rationale behind using this assumption was that restraints from the neck would not significantly contribute to the head responses if the simulations were very short.

A number of response parameters, such as the maximum von Mises stress (σv) and principal strain (εp) of the skull, intracranial pressure (ICP), and σv, and εp of the brain, were selected for usage in analyses of injury risks and comparisons with injuries that were actually observed. As opposed to commonly used single peak values, values for all response parameters used for injury analysis in this study were selected based on an advanced averaging method. This method incorporates nodal averaging of elemental results and makes use of a post-processing environment, HyperView (Altair, Troy, MI). This method can reduce effects ill-formed elements might have on the results, because the nodal averaging of elemental results at a node refers to the average of all the element corner (or centroidal) results passing through that node [46]. The HyperView environment provided simple, advanced, and difference averaging methods for nodal averaging of elemental results. For this study, the advanced averaging method was chosen. For more detailed information about the advanced averaging method, refer to the HyperView User's Guide.

                           Fig. 3
                            shows acceleration–time histories obtained during the head dropping processes from both the model and the experiment. It can be seen that the patterns are similar. The quantitative comparisons of peak accelerations, corresponding time points, and durations of the acceleration pulses are listed in Table 5
                           . The results show that the largest discrepancy (−8.2%) occurred at a drop height of 15 cm. In other cases, the differences in peak accelerations were within 5.5%. In all of the cases, the discrepancies of time points at peak accelerations and pulse widths were lower than 5%.


                           Fig. 4
                            illustrates the comparisons of simulated and measured compressive force–deflection curves at strain rates of 0.0005, 0.001, 0.1, and 0.3 s−1. The results showed good agreements. The maximum discrepancy was 7.5%, which took place at the strain rate of 0.3 s−1. At this strain rate, when the head deflection was smaller than 2.3 mm, a very good agreement could be observed. After 2.3 mm of deflection, the predicted compressive force was slightly lower than that of the experimental data, with a maximum discrepancy of 7.5%. This occurred at the head deflection of 2.5 mm.

Since no injury data were included in the cadaveric tests, the injury analysis in this study was only conducted on the falling accident, with the focus on skull and brain-tissue injuries.

                            show the distributions of simulated von Mises stress (σv) and principal strain (εp) on the skull. The maximum values of σv and εp of the skull were observed close to the site of impact. The peak values increased with increasing drop height. The maximum σv and εp predicted by the model were compared with the ultimate stress and tensile strain obtained through mechanical tests, and the results are shown in Table 6. The maximum σv among all simulations was 40.6 MPa, which was lower than the ultimate stress obtained from the 6-YO skull (82.87 MPa) [13] and the adult skull (92.72 MPa) [47]. The predicted maximum εp was 0.4%, which was lower than the failure strain of the 6-YO skull (3.3%) [13] and the adult skull (0.52%) [47]. These simulation results indicate a low risk of skull fracture, which is consistent with the medical record reported for the accident, where no skull fracture was observed [44].
                           
                        

Following the approach of Kleiven [48], intracranial pressure (ICP), σv, and εp were selected as the response parameters for the analysis of the brain injuries. Fig. 7
                            shows the distribution of peak ICPs in the brain. The model-predicted ICPs form a gradient pattern, which is common in blunt-impact loading conditions. At the drop heights of 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 m, the occipital lobe at the impact side exhibited the highest ICPs (359, 433, and 572 kPa, respectively), whereas the frontal lobe showed the maximum negative ICPs (−251, −258, and −273 kPa, respectively). These values exceeded the injury tolerance of −186 kPa reported in Ward et al. [35]. A more detailed summary of the simulation results is given in Table 7
                           .


                           Fig. 8
                            shows the distributions of von Mises stress, σv, at 3.50, 3.55, and 3.60 ms post impact for the three drop heights, respectively. It can be seen that the maximum values occur at boundaries between the frontal and the right-parietal lobes, and on the external surfaces of the temporal lobe. The high σv predicted by the model for the external surface of the temporal lobe was consistent with the impact position. The high σv predicted by the model for the frontal and the right-parietal lobes was consistent with the locations of the subdural hematoma with transtentorial herniation found on the victim [44]. The maximum values of σv at the three drop heights were 5.40, 6.71, and 7.81 kPa, respectively. The maximum value of σv predicted at the drop height of 1.5 m was higher than the injury threshold value of the σv-based injury criterion for macroscopic hemorrhagic cortical contusions (7 kPa) in adult miniature pigs, as reported by Miller et al. [49].


                           Fig. 9
                            demonstrates distributions of peak principal strains, εp, at 3.30, 3.40, and 3.55 ms post impact for the three drop heights, respectively. The location exhibited with the highest magnitude occurred near the corpus callosum and brainstem. This might be relevant with decerebrate posturing, which is usually an indicator of brainstem damage [51], as observed in the victim. The maximum values of εp at the three falling heights were 8%, 12%, and 15%, respectively. Considering the εp tolerance for the adult concussion (21%) [48], pig brain diffuse axonal injury (DAI) (27%) [49], and squid DAI (20%) [50], the simulated results were much lower than these reported thresholds.

Based on the kinematic responses, the head injury criterion (HIC), the brain injury criterion (BrIC), and the head impact power (HIP) were also used to evaluate the risk of injury. The respective expressions are shown below [52,53]:

The values of HIC, BrIC and HIP were calculated in accordance with Equations 2–4 and are shown in Table 8
                           . The results show that HIC at the three drop heights were 248.7, 395.3, and 468.6, respectively. They were higher than the threshold of 250 for mild traumatic brain injury [54], but lower than the threshold of 700 for serious traumatic brain injury [54]. The BrIC at the three drop heights were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.32, respectively, which were lower than the threshold of 0.68 for mild traumatic brain injury, as reported by Takhounts et al. [55]. The HIPs at the three drop heights were 36.87, 43.65, and 50.86 kW, respectively, higher than the threshold of mild traumatic brain injury (12.79 kW) reported by Newman et al. [54]. Only the HIP value at the drop height of 1.5 m was higher than the threshold of subdural hematoma (50 kW) reported by Kleiven [52].

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this study, data from compression and drop tests on a 9-YO child-cadaver specimen were used to validate the model representing the 10-YO head. Then, a fall accident was reconstructed, and our model predicted reasonable injury responses. From the literature, the lack of experimental data has limited pediatric model development. Very few quantitatively validated FEMs representing children's heads have been reported. For example, Roth et al. [20] established an FEM representing a newborn head. This FEM was verified by data collected from experiments involving a neonate head. Li et al. [23] built a model representing the head of a 6-MO and validated it against test data. In other studies, model validations were usually implemented by scaling test data from adult-cadaver specimens and accident reconstructions [18,19,21,22,24,25].

In the drop test simulations, the acceleration responses were in good agreement with experimental data. The maximum discrepancy was found in the case of impact to the crown of the head. The maximum difference in acceleration was −8.2%. Under quasi-static compression, the simulated and measured force–deflection curves had a reasonable match. The maximum discrepancy was 7.5%, which was believed to be due to the following reasons: (1) In the current skull model, trabecular and cortical bones were not separated and the material parameters were obtained through scaling of the adult data. (2) There were intrinsic differences between the cadaveric specimens and the model in terms of age and head dimensions.

For almost all available adult brain models, the intracranial pressure time histories, reported for experimental case 37 by Nahum et al. [7], were used as a source of model validation. This validation scheme was not adopted for the present study. Reasons include the lack of available ICP data based on pediatric experiments and the lack of proper methods to scale adult experimental ICP data to the child. Although scaling of adult experimental data to validate child models was a common method used in many studies [24,26,37,56], scaling of adult ICP data for children may not be appropriate. One scaling method is based on the conservation of energy [57] and another is based on equal stress equal velocity [58]. Both are good for scaling kinematic responses and loading conditions, but there is no proof that ICP can be scaled in the same manner. Particularly, the thickness and material properties of the skull could affect the ICP value [12]. For example, a thinner and more compliant skull, typical for children, could allow a change in shape during impact. This would, in turn, result in a reduction in ICP. Because the adult skull is stiffer than that of the child, it could provide a stronger constraint and result in an increase in ICP. This reasoning prohibits the use of scaling methods to represent ICP in child from adult data.

In the skull injury analysis, the maximum σv (40.6 MPa) represented only 43.8% of the adult skull fracture threshold [47] and 49.0% of that of the 6-YO child [13]. Additionally, the maximum principal strain (εp) predicted by the model was 0.4%, which represented only 76.9% of the adult injury threshold reported by Wood [47] and 11.7% of the 6-YO child injury threshold reported by Davis et al. [13]. For these reasons, the probability of a skull fracture occurring in this case was considered to be very low. This was consistent with the real world observation. Since there was no skull injury observed in the accident, it was not possible to obtain σv or εp based injury criterion at the current stage.

In the accident reconstruction, the maximum ICP predicted by the model (359 kPa) occurred in the lowest drop height case. It represented 5.5 times the ICP-based injury threshold, reported by Kleiven [48], for a 50% risk of sustaining brain coup contusion. In other words, the model predicted ICP indicated a high risk of brain-tissue injury. However, in the selected real world case, subdural hematoma with transtentorial herniation occurred at locations with the highest σv (i.e., the boundary between the frontal and the right-parietal lobes, and on the external surface of the temporal lobe), rather than at the impact locations with the highest positive (coup site) and highest negative (contrecoup site) pressures. According to these results, ICP cannot accurately predict brain injury, but it may reflect the overall energy level of the impact event [59].

The brain region predicted by the model to have high σv coincided with the locations of the subdural hematoma with transtentorial herniation and the impact position [44]. The model-predicted peak σv (7.81 kPa) simulating a 1.5 m drop was slightly higher than the 7 kPa reported by Miller et al. [49] for a cortical contusion in a miniature pig. It is suspected that the initial loss of consciousness observed in the victim may have been related to the high intracranial σv calculated from the model. However, more studies are needed to ensure that this assumption is correctly stated.

The regions with high εp predicted by the current model have been found to be consistent with regions, reported in many studies, where DAIs induced by blunt impact [60,61] or rapid acceleration [62,63] are commonly found. These regions include the corpus callosum and the dorsolateral quadrant (or quadrants) of the rostral brainstem adjacent to the superior cerebellar peduncles, which are particularly prone to DAI [62]. It should be noted that the high εp predicted by the current model only captured the common and prone regions of DAI, and that the actual location of the DAI in the falling accident was not reported. In a couple of published studies, the maximum εp was used to predict DAI risks [48–50]. The model-predicted peak εp for the 1.5 m drop height was 15%. This magnitude was lower than several modeling studies. For instance, a 20% threshold was reported by Galbraith et al. [50] for squid DAIs, a 27% threshold was reported by Miller et al. [49] for miniature pig DAIs, and a 21% threshold was reported by Kleiven [48] for National Football League (NFL) concussion cases. Because the victim was observed to lose consciousness before arriving at the hospital, it is possible that the εp-based injury threshold in a child may be lower than those reported for adults and animals. More studies are needed to identify the differences in concussion and DAI thresholds between children and adults.

Lastly, the injury analysis results based on the head kinematic responses showed that only the HIP at the drop height of 1.5 m was higher than the threshold of subdural hematoma [52]; HIC and BrIC were lower than the threshold of mild traumatic brain injury.

This study has some limitations. First, the resolution of the skull geometric data is relatively low, which affects the accuracy of the mesh. It is difficult to accurately separate trabecular from cortical components of the bones. Therefore, there was no separation made. Second, due to the lack of mechanical tests in pediatric brains, biomaterial properties reported for pediatric brain tissues were mostly based on testing of animal specimens. Due to structural and compositional differences, and the unclear relationship between age and the stages of development between humans and animals, these data cannot be directly applied to represent a 10-YO child. Additionally, there is a large discrepancy on the biomechanical properties of age-dependent brain tissues [41,42]. The only material properties based on human pediatric brain tissues were reported by Chatelin et al. [39] for age groups of 2 months, 5 months, and 22–23 months. When comparisons were made between these pediatric data and data derived from people 55 years of age, previously reported by the same research group, it was found that material properties for a 10-YO would be closer to that for adults. Additionally, Thibault and Margulies [41] reported that the biological constituents of human brain tissues changed rapidly during infancy and toddlerhood. Therefore, for an adolescent, 10-YO child, it is assumed that the material properties would be closer to those of adults. For these reasons, the adult brain material properties were used in the current FE model of the child's head. The pediatric material properties will be updated once the data are available. Third, in several adult head models (e.g., Kleiven and Hardy [64]; Takhounts et al. [65]; Mao et al. [4]), several pairs of bridging veins were explicitly modeled and the Relative Motion Damage Measure (RMDM) proposed by Takhounts et al. [65] was used to evaluate the risk of acute subdural hematoma. In the current model, no bridging veins were modeled, because no literature was found that addressed the numbers, locations, angles, lengths, and cross-sectional diameters of bridging veins for a 10-YO. Additionally, medical images obtained did not have sufficient resolution to identify these parameters. Future studies should include the geometric measurements of bridging veins to estimate the risk of sustaining a subdural hematoma. Fourth, although the brain responses (e.g., von Mises stress, ICP, and principal strain) were used to predict brain injury, no validation on the brain responses was possible due to a lack of experimental studies on pediatric brain response. Lastly, without the age-specific head injury criteria and tolerances, this study adopted adult and animal head injury criteria and tolerances for injury analysis in accident reconstruction. Further investigations regarding head injury criteria and tolerances for the 10-YO child need to be performed.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this study, a modified FEM representing a 10-YO head was validated against quasi-static compression and dynamic drop test data. The validated model was then used for a falling accident reconstruction and injury analysis. The model validation on kinematic responses demonstrated high biofidelity and was capable of capturing acceleration–time histories in drop tests and force–deflection responses with sufficiently small discrepancies in compression tests. The largest drop test discrepancy for peak acceleration was −8.2% at the drop height of 15 cm, and the force–deflection responses in the compression tests had a maximum discrepancy of 7.5% at the strain rate of 0.3 s−1. Despite the high biofidelity, this model lacks validation with experimentally obtained brain responses, which is a substantial limitation. In the future, the model should be refined to include available pediatric experimental data of brain responses.

The model-predicted σv and εp in the skull, ICP, maximum σv and εp in the brain, and kinematics-based head injury criteria (HIC, BrIC, and HIP) have been used for analyzing the risks of injury in accident reconstruction. Based on the current results of injury analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) ICP cannot be used to accurately predict the location of brain injury, but it may reflect the overall energy level of the impact event. (2) The brain regions predicted by the model to have high σv coincide with the locations where subdural hematoma with transtentorial herniation and impact occur. (3) The regions predicted by the model to have high εp coincide with locations commonly found where DAI due to blunt-impact and rapid acceleration took place.
