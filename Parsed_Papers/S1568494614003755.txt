               Abstract
               
                  This paper assesses effectiveness of dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) models in predicting the compressive strength of dry-cast concretes, and compares their prediction performances with those of regression, neural network (NN) and ANFIS models. The results of this study emphasized capabilities of online first-order and offline high-order Takagiâ€“Sugeno (TSK) type DENFIS models for prediction purposes, whereas offline first-order TSK-type DENFIS models did not produce reliable results. Comparison between the produced results of an elite high-order DENFIS model with those predicted by the selected NN, regression and ANFIS models showed effectiveness of DENFIS model than the regression model, while its performance was similar to or slightly better than the other artificial prediction tools.
