                  Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has been used in manufacturing industries to create a RFID-enabled ubiquitous environment, in where ultimate real-time advanced production planning and scheduling (APPS) will be achieved with the goal of collective intelligence. A particular focus has been placed upon using the vast amount of RFID production shop floor data to obtain more precise and reasonable estimates of APPS parameters such as the arrival of customer orders and standard operation times (SOTs). The resulting APPS model is based on hierarchical production decision-making principle to formulate planning and scheduling levels. A RFID-event driven mechanism is adopted to integrate these two levels for collective intelligence. A heuristic approach using a set of rules is utilized to solve the problem. The model is tested through four dimensions, including the impact of rule sequences on decisions, evaluation of released strategy to control the amount of production order from planning to scheduling, comparison with another model and practical operations, as well as model robustness. Two key findings are observed. First, release strategy based on the RFID-enabled real-time information is efficient and effective to reduce the total tardiness by 44.46% averagely. Second, it is observed that the model has the immune ability on disturbances like defects. However, as the increasing of the problem size, the model robustness against emergency orders becomes weak; while, the resistance to machine breakdown is strong oppositely. Findings and observations are summarized into a number of managerial implications for guiding associated end-users for purchasing collective intelligence in practice.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the last decade, manufacturing sectors had significant interests in RFID (radio frequency identification) applications. In this context, the motivation for integrating production planning and scheduling is a gain in collective intelligence: it is more effective and faster to carry out manufacturing operations within the RFID-enabled real-time ubiquitous environment where ultimate advanced production planning and scheduling (APPS) maybe enabled [1]. In this paper, APPS in RFID-enabled real-time ubiquitous manufacturing shop floor has several key characteristics comparing with typical production sites.

Firstly, decision-making using a hierarchical approach is divided into two levels: production planning and scheduling. In planning level, production orders are sequenced to minimize the total differences of finished time and due date. In scheduling level, jobs are determined in an optimal sequence descripting when a job will be processed by which machine/operator to minimize the total tardiness. From planning to scheduling, a production order maybe split into several batches each of which is regarded as a job that contains 180 pieces of items.

Secondly, production scheduling follows up a hybrid flow shop (HFS) principle. In HFS, there are several stages each of which has several machines with similar function. Jobs are processed within these stages in strict sequences. Some stages may be ignored according to the technique requirements.

Thirdly, the concept of real-time job pool plays an imperative role in the RFID-enabled ubiquitous manufacturing environment [2]. Two types of job pool are used. One is for production orders in planning level, where the real-time job pool is responsible for sequencing, managing, and releasing the production orders. The other is for each stage in scheduling level, where it is responsible for sequencing and releasing jobs by RFID-driven events. A RFID event is behaved when a reader detect a tag which is described in the RFID-enabled real-time ubiquitous manufacturing shop floor later.

Fourthly, rules play significant roles in this RFID-enabled ubiquitous manufacturing environment. In planning level, production orders are sequenced in the job pool according to their priorities, customer importance, earliest due date (EDD) and first in first out (FIFO). In scheduling level, jobs are sequenced in the job pool according to material-based grouping, shortest processing time (SPT) and order-based rule. Additionally, a job assigned to a specific machine from the job pool may consider some rules such as material property and machine processing speed.

Finally, manufacturing resources like machines, materials and workers are equipped with RFID devices. Once bound by RFID, they become smart manufacturing objects (SMOs) which are able to sense, interact, and behave according to the production workflows within the environment, where APPS could be deterministic since RFID technology enables the real-time data collection instantly. Thus, the traditional hierarchical decision-making principle is upgraded into a closed-loop fashion that the real-time information such as operator statuses, machine situations, job progresses, and material arrivals at scheduling level could be fed back to planning level.

Due to the key features of APPS in RFID-enabled real-time ubiquitous manufacturing environment, several challenges exist when conducting operation decisions. The arrival of customer orders is highly stochastic firstly, which causes a large variability of production orders. In most cases, specific possibilities like normal distribution are given for theoretical analysis [3]. However, in real-life practice, the possibility may be diversified, thus, the precise estimation of their arrivals is critical. Secondly, orders release from planning level to the 1st stage of scheduling level is difficult to carry out due to the variability. In most investigated companies, there is no any control mechanism. As a result, decisions in scheduling level are usually interrupted and re-planning & re-scheduling are frequently executed. Thirdly, plans and schedules within the RFID-enabled ubiquitous manufacturing heavily rely on standard operation times (SOTs). Deviations of the SOTs exist because different operators have different skill levels and large number of impact factors such as shifts may have influence on the time [4].

In order to address the above challenges, this paper proposes an APPS model for facilitating the collective intelligence within the RFID-enabled ubiquitous environment. Several research questions are concerned and the corresponding methodologies are proposed.
                        
                           •
                           How can we precisely estimate the arrivals of production orders so that plans and schedules based on the estimation are more accurate and practical? This paper introduces an approach integrate least square polynomial fitting (LSPT) and exponential distribution estimation to discover the actual distribution from long- and short-term aspects. Using the Poisson process, the arrival of production orders could be predicted reasonably.

How can we define a release strategy after estimating the arrivals of production orders so that plans and schedules could be balanced to reduce the re-planning and re-scheduling operations ultimately? This paper reports on a model which integrates the planning and scheduling levels through RFID-event driven mechanism to obtain a strategy which indicates the optimal percentage for this purpose. Specifically a control mechanism is proposed to determine the optimal amount of production orders released from planning to scheduling level.

How can we establish a mathematic model to obtain the optimal results in planning and scheduling level within the RFID-enabled ubiquitous manufacturing environment so that limited production resources could be concerned? This paper proposes a model which integrates stochastic elements like production arrival and deterministic factors like machine, operator and jobs by using RFID technology so as to adaptively guide the manufacturing resources to obtain the optimal results for collective intelligence.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the key related work which is categorized into RFID-enabled ubiquitous manufacturing, advanced production planning and scheduling (APPS), and hybrid flow shop (HFS) scheduling. Section 3 introduces a RFID-enabled real-time ubiquitous shop floor manufacturing. Section 4 illustrates the problem description in terms of symbols and assumptions. In Section 5, a two-level model and solution framework are presented. Experiments and discussions are proposed in Section 6, which presents the managerial implications based on the experimental results.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

RFID with ubiquitous sensing ability has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its outstanding advantages in identifying objects, real-time data collection and efficient information transmission [5]. Manufacturing industry observed the opportunities of using such technology for creating an RFID-enabled ubiquitous environment so as to improve the production decision-making with the final goal of intelligent manufacturing [6]. This section reports on this topic from technical aspects and application cases.

In technical aspects, recent movement and development are integrating some advanced technologies and concepts in creating the RFID-enabled ubiquitous manufacturing sites. For typical RFID behaviors such as reading and writing, an event-driven mechanism was proposed for facilitating the RFID detections [7]. This research classifies the events according to different hierarchical structures which associates with essential event, primitive event, basic event, complex event and critical event for constructing the RFID data in manufacturing operations. With these events, manufacturing resources could be identified, tracked, and categorized for different purposes. In order to control the production tasks and work-in-progress (WIP) inventory, agents technology was integrated with RFID in the ubiquitous manufacturing environment [8,9]. By means of a set of agents for realizing different control, the manufacturing system could be enhanced in terms of agility, flexibility, and re-configurability. As the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud technologies, RFID twined with these technologies in the ubiquitous manufacturing is emerging. RFID identified production resources were converted into smart manufacturing objects (SMOs) which are able to sense, behave, and interact adaptively within the ubiquitous environment for achieving intelligent manufacturing with advanced decision models [10,11]. Decision models are changed within the RFID-enabled real-time ubiquitous manufacturing environment. Reported studies related to such models focus on WIP control, logistics optimization, and production optimization [12–15].

Successful application cases of RFID-enabled real-time ubiquitous manufacturing cover wide areas. A case from a large-scale and heavy-duty machinery manufacturer using RFID for shop floor management was introduced [16]. In this case, workers, machines, and materials are controlled real-timely for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of shop floor production. In order to evaluate the multi-agent approach in RFID-enabled manufacturing scheduling, a case was presented to demonstrate the re-scheduling strategy with real-time feedback [17]. Four types of agents are designed and evaluated in the case to examine the feasibility and practicality in real-life companies. A RFID-enabled real-time advanced planning and scheduling shell (RAPShell) was illustrated from an automotive manufacturer case to integrate production decision-makings [18]. RAPShell is able to enhance the information sharing by RFID technology and facilitate the production planning, scheduling, and execution. A RFID-based manufacture process control and supply chain management (SCM) case from semiconductor industry was given to improve the warehouse and production lines [19]. This case shows the benefits from using RFID in saved manpower cost and information transmission between customers and suppliers. From the literature, most of the case uses the RFID for creating the ubiquitous manufacturing environment so as to improve the information sharing, item tracking, data visibility and traceability [20–22]. Decision-making models for production planning and scheduling using RFID-captured data in such environment are limited.

APPS also referred to as advanced manufacturing, adverts a management process by which materials, production capacities and related sources are optimally allocated to meet specific demand [23]. APPS was proposed to facilitate the production planning so that plans could be carried out more smoothly [24]. With the development of advanced manufacturing technologies such as wireless manufacturing and intelligent manufacturing, APPS has been widely extended. The extensions could be divided into two dimensions: theory and practice.

In theoretical perspective, large numbers of models or algorithms have been introduced to integrate or solve the problems within production planning, scheduling, execution, and control. Integration of the hierarchical production decision-making is necessary before considering a further optimization of manufacturing decisions because different entities interconnect collaboratively and numerous trade-offs exist [25]. To this end, a nonlinear model was presented for defining new operating points to increase productivity in a static manufacturing environment [26]. However, typical production ambiences are full of dynamics such as machine breakdown and emergency orders which bring great difficulties to work out the optimal plans and schedules [27]. In order to address the dynamic APPS problem, a genetic algorithm (GA) was developed to figure out a schedule that both production idle time and penalties on tardiness and earliness are minimized under the continuous basis of order arrivals [28]. Currently, flexible manufacturing has been widely considered in APPS. However, most of the models and algorithms are based on specific hypothesis and experiments focus on numerical studies. Real-life examples are scarcely reported from the literature.

In practical perspective, several case studies about APPS are presented. A case of consumer goods in dynamic complex supply chain was demonstrated to solve the planning and scheduling problems [29]. In this case, a framework for investigating dynamics within the planning and scheduling is proposed. However, this case converts the problem into NP-hard which is solved contemplatively by a GA-based intelligent search approach. In order to simplify the problem scope and implement APPS to a compute feasible production plant, an aluminum conversion industry (ACI) was taken into account [30]. This case shows the feasibility and practicality of some key principles such as constraint-based planning, finite capacity scheduling etc. APPS for particular areas are widely studied such as chemical and pharmaceutical production which are typical process industry [31].

From the literature, most APPS applications are laid on process industry which mainly adopts HFS principle in a plant. HFS usually compromises several production stages, each of which is equipped by several machines with same functionality [32]. This problem is divided into specific categories: two-stage, three-stage and k-stage (k
                        >3). Given its significance in terms of practicality and complexity, this problem has been intensively studied [33]. Studies on this problem mainly focus on two dimensions. One is problem modeling under different considerations. The other is solution design for obtaining better performance.

In problem modeling, various considerations from practical and hypothetical perspectives are concerned in literature. One of the key concerns is buffer. [34] investigated a HFS model with finite intermediate buffers so as to minimize the sum of weighted completion time of all jobs. The experiments on randomly generated instances with different structures indicate that a tabu search heuristic solution outperforms other algorithms. In order to bridge the gap between theory and practice, a two-stage HFS problem was modeled with specific concerns about machining from the first and second stage [35]. This paper analyzes this problem from a small scope with the worst cases analysis. For a bigger scope, like entire manufacturing plant, a realistic manufacturing environment was modeled through a flexible HFS principle [36]. This model considers several constraints and characteristics that mainly influence the scheduling in a company. Within a flexible HFS system, the setup times are sequence dependent to minimize makespan and maximum tardiness [37].

In solution design, large numbers of approaches aim to address the HFS problem with more suitable and reasonable results. Since orders arrive dynamically, estimation of their lead times is critical before scheduling. To this end, various scheduling rules such as FCFS (First Come First Serve), EDD, and SPT were examined in HFS [38,39]. In scheduling stage, this problem is NP-hard in the strong sense. Thus, heuristic approaches are widely used to get near-optimal solutions. A simulated annealing and the variable-depth search optimization procedure was introduced to first sequence and then allocate jobs to machines [40]. The efficiency of this procedure is proved by computational experiments. In this way, this problem can be decomposed into machine type sub-problems, thus, better schedules are generated in much shorter computation time. A comprehensive review of the solutions for HFS was carried out from theoretical, empirical and computational research and some common approaches were highlighted such as travelling salesman problem (TSP), GA, ACO (Ant Colony Optimization), and PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) [41].

                      shows a created RFID-enabled real-time ubiquitous shop floor manufacturing environment, where low frequency is used due to its anti-humidity ability and suitability in metal-based environments. RFID devices are systematically deployed in manufacturing sites such as warehouse and shop floors as follows:
                        
                           (1)
                           A stationary reader is deployed at raw-material loading area in warehouse. It is used for binding tags into raw-materials which are batched in a basket with standard quantity.

Another stationary reader is located at finished products receiving area in warehouse. It is used for killing and recycling tags.

A LF tag is deployed on a basket with 180 items as a batch. Once tagged, the basket is converted into passive smart manufacturing object (PSMO), which carries production data throughout the manufacturing stages.

A stationary reader is deployed on each machine. Once deployed, machines are converted into active smart manufacturing objects (ASMOs) which are able to detect the PSMOs and assist workers to carrying out the production logics. Each worker has a RFID staff card for identifying individuals and their work.

Each logistics operator carries a mobile reader due to its frequent delivery movements.

Wireless network devices like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth are deployed at proper positions to ensure the signal coverage so that ASMOs and PSMOs can real-timely capture the production data and transfer them to a database/data warehouse.

After the deployment of RFID devices and communication network in production sites, a RFID-enabled real-time ubiquitous manufacturing environment is created. Within this environment, production operations and decision-makings are different comparing with traditional shop floors. The re-engineered and rationalized production operations are elaborated as follows:
                        
                           ①: Raw-materials are batched in a basket which is bound by a RFID tag. Each batch/basket is regarded as a job. An external logistics operator (ELO) uses a mobile reader to sense the tags and the logistics tasks are automatically confirmed. If wrong tags are sensed, an alarm will be given. Once the batches are picked, he moves them to a buffer in the first manufacturing stage, where a receiver will do the material hand-over by patting his staff card on the ELO’s mobile reader.

②: Once the hand-over operation finished, production schedules will be released to the job pool for the first manufacturing stage automatically. A machine operator (MO) pats his staff card on a stationary reader deployed on the machine, then a job with top priority will be released to him from the job pool. An internal logistics operator (ILO) will be informed by the carried mobile reader to move the job required batches (materials) from shop floor butter to the machine buffer. Once the materials arrive, the MO will confirm by patting his staff card. MO can get the job instructions, technical parameters, and inspection standards via the deployed stationary reader. After the completion of processing in the machine, he presses a button on the reader to inform the inspectors to do quality check. After inspection, the inspector will pat his staff card to inform the ELOs to move the batch to next processing stage.

③: Once get the logistics tasks, an ELO carries a mobile reader to detect the tag on a batch. Then, he is able to move the batch to the buffer in next processing stage.

④: In the next processing stage, the same operations in ② will be executed. If it is the last processing stage, the finished products will be assigned to ELOs who will move them from machine buffers to the warehouse.

⑤: An ELO gets the message from the carried mobile reader that a finished batch should be shipped to warehouse. He uses the reader to detect the batch and move it to the finished products receiving area, where a warehouse worker uses the stationary reader to kill and recycle the tags.

In this section, an APPS model is described for facilitating production planning and scheduling in the RFID-enabled real-time ubiquitous shop floor manufacturing. In the first place, the indices, set, model input and decision variables are introduced. Secondly, the objective function and constraints are demonstrated from planning and scheduling levels respectively.

Symbols used in this model are categorized into indices and set, model input as well as variables.

                         and its operators are equipped by RFID devices (e.g. readers and tags). Operators pat their staff cards (RFID tags) to obtain jobs from a real-time job pool which is responsible for sequencing the split jobs at each stage [2,42]. The pool for stage 
                           
                              k
                           
                         releases jobs to specific machine and its operators according to dispatching rules [43].

Job pools for the 1st and last stage should be considered specifically. Firstly, a set of jobs

                              }
                           
                         will be sequenced in the pool for 1st stage according to the weight 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    ω
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                         (priority). Each job will be assigned to a vacant machine through patting the staff card by its operator. After processing in 1st stage, it enters into the pool for next processing stage until all the necessary stages are fulfilled. Secondly, at the last stage, jobs must be accomplished on time so as to follow a backward propagation strategy. In such case, jobs in the pool must be fulfilled as fast as possible. That means earliness of jobs is beneficial to this system without considering the inventory costs. Meaningfully, the makespan is minimized and machine utilization is maximized.

In order to solve this problem, several critical assumptions are made:
                           
                              (1)
                              The behaviors of job pools, machines, and their operators are based on RFID-enabled event (logics). That means jobs from pools are released to specific operator when he/she patting his staff card on a reader.

The intermediate buffer between each stage is unlimited so that jobs can be processed continuously.

Jobs follow rigid mode from one stage to another: stage 1

Jobs are released from planning to scheduling level at a fixed time (e.g. 7am) daily.

Each job (a batch) has 180 items.

Three shifts are considered and each has 8h.

Machine operators are divided into three categories according their skill levels.

Each machine operator is responsible for operating a specific machine within a working shift. Multi-skilling is not considered in this case.

Machines work parallel and continuously.

There are adequate operators who are able to process jobs in different shifts without halt.

Each machine can process no more than one job at a time and machine breakdown will not occur within

                                 .

The standard operation times (SOTs) for each process is estimated from a model and it will be fine-tuned according to the key impact factors such as shifts and skill level when an operator pats his staff card to get a job [4].

                         which is the sum of required processing time for each production order. Constraint 2 defines the total number of production orders given the possibility of their arrivals. Thus, the number is more reasonable and practical. Constraint 3 defines the required processing time for each production order. Constraint 4 reflects the real-time deterministic availability of machines through RFID event. Constraint 5 reveals the sequence of production orders. Constraint 6 defines the identical product from each production order.

In this level, the objective is to minimize the total tardiness. Constraint 7 defines the completion time of a job at a stage under considering specific situations like machines, workers and shifts. Constraint 8 defines the practical processing time of a job. Constraint 9 reveals the number of jobs (batches) split from a production order and constraint 10 shows the total number of jobs from the released production orders. Constraint 11 and 12 define the weights and material attributes of jobs within and at different subsets respectively. Constraint 13 guarantees that all machines could be operated by workers at various stages. Constraint 14 reflects the RFID events happened at various machines. Constraint 15 ensures that there is a job processed on a machine at a stage at any time.

In the above formulation, several aspects are significant in practical cases. Firstly, the possibility of production order arrivals is hardly to predict. That may greatly affect the plans and schedules. Historic data is used for working out the possibility in this paper. Secondly, the arrived production orders will be released from planning to scheduling level. How many orders could be released is difficult to address in real-life situations. A theorem is proposed to support the decision-making. Thirdly, jobs are sequenced in pools according to their weights. The sequencing strategy may influence the results given different considerations (e.g. different dispatching rules). We carry out a large number of experiments to find out which sequencing strategy is mostly suitable in different situations.

This theorem indicates that the release strategy from planning level to scheduling level mainly relies on the bottleneck from the production stages. Take stage 
                           
                              k
                           
                         as the bottleneck stage for example, the total required processing time from the released orders should be less or equal to the maximum machine capacity in this stage. Otherwise, at least one order must be delayed.

In this section, the overall solution framework based on an iterative procedure which ensures consistent and optimal results between planning and scheduling is presented. Decision rules play a critical role in this framework. The overall flowchart is shown in Fig. 3
                        . There are several key decision-making points within the above solution.
                           
                              1.
                              Production orders are sequenced in a pool according to their weights that are determined by due date and customer importance. The sequenced results aim to meet the objective function.

Machine capacity at each stage could be calculated through the real-time RFID events from manufacturing sites. Thus, the minimum capacity at a certain stage could be figured out.

Production orders are released given current machine capacity. The required processing time from the released production orders should meet the minimum machine capacity provided at a specific stage.

The released production orders are split into a set of jobs, some of which are grouped if they are from a same order. Jobs are sequenced in pools at various stages according to their weights so as to meet the objective.

Jobs are assigned to a machine when an operator performs a RFID event (read his/her staff card). Jobs with top weight will be released to the machine from the pool.

Job release and sequence are based on various dispatching rules until the end of the processing stage. Meanwhile, within different stages, the processing time of a job will be provided given the shift and operator’s skill level instantly.

RFID-driven mechanism plays significant roles in the solution. In the first place, manufacturing resources like machines, materials and workers are labelled by RFID technology to create a ubiquitous environment. Thus, all information such as machine status, job progress, worker availability and material location is deterministic when production activities carry out within the environment. Secondly, any disturbances like machine breakdown or emergency orders could be addressed through RFID-enabled adaptive re-planning and re-scheduling strategy. As a result, the robustness of the planning and scheduling system achieves a real-time fashion to resist change without profound alterations. Thirdly, by the assistance of RFID technology, the decisions are simplified to determine the weights of various jobs and sequenced in the pools for different stage. Workers pick up the jobs with high weight from the pools; meanwhile, the objectives are met.

This section presents a set of experiments to evaluate the proposed models. Discussions on the results from various experiments are carried out so that managerial implications could be observed to assist different users in facilitating their decision-makings.

Production orders, as the key input into the model, usually arrive stochastically (see Table 1
                        ). This section demonstrates an approach to find a more precise possibility of their arrivals from real-world data through polynomial fitting and queuing theory. Thus, the estimation of production order arrivals could be more reasonable and accurate.

From Fig. 4
                        (a), the arrival of production orders may obeys exponential distribution according to the polynomial fitting results. What exponential distribution could precisely descript the production order arrivals? To answer this question, estimation of the best exponent is carried out. The experimental results are shown on Fig. 4(c), where each curve represents a function with an exponent. The best exponent (
                           
                              λ

                        ) is chosen according to the comparison of data samples, polynomial fitting, and exponential distribution estimation. Therefore, the possibility of monthly production arrival could be obtained:

Production planning and scheduling are usually carried out every day, day-to-day production order arrival will greatly influence the decision-making. To examine the daily arrival of production orders, Poisson process is considered because it counts the number of events under a discrete probability distribution, expressing the possibility of a given number of events happened in a fixed interval of time if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event [44].

The proposed model is evaluated by real-world data from a collaborative company who has used RFID technology for supporting its shop floor production over 7years. Specifically, data from 2010 are picked up because they reflect the actual and recent production statuses of the company. A typical product S-02 is selected for the evaluation and key experimental parameters are listed in appendices Table A.1.

First is evaluating the impacts of rules on decisions (e.g. plans and schedules). A rich set of rules is widely used in the company and their sequences may great influence the decisions. Several key rules used by planning and scheduling level are listed as follows: (1) EDD; (2) customer importance; (3) priority-based rule; (4) FIFO; (5) SPT; (6) order-based rule; (7) material-based grouping. These rules are typically used in the company to make the optimal sequences of production orders and jobs.


                        Table 3
                         demonstrates the experimental results (experiment data attached in appendix Table A.2 and A.3) from comparing the total tardiness (
                           
                              ∑
                              TD
                           
                        ) under different sequences of rules. From the Table 3, for simplicity but without generality, we list several optimal experimental results that reveal the influences of specific sequences. At production planning level, four rules are utilized with a sequence. At production scheduling level, the sequenced production orders are split into several jobs. Five rules are adopted for determining their sequences. It is observed that, from the experimental results, at planning level, priority-based rule is considered preferentially; while, at scheduling level, order-based rule is favored. That means the weight of each order plays imperative role in production planning and split jobs are grouped in scheduling to achieve the objectives. The optimal sequence of rules is (3)(2)(1)(4) – (6)(7)(3)(5)(4) with minimum total tardiness of 34.

Second is evaluating the feasibility and practicality of the proposed release strategy by using the production order from June 2009 as data samples. Table 4
                         demonstrates the evaluation results through calculating the orders on time and 
                           
                              ∑
                              TD
                           
                         from comparing the results with and without using the release strategy.

From Table 4, it can be seen that, the release strategy is able to control the quantity of production order from planning to scheduling as well as to reduce the total tardiness. The quantitative effectiveness could be interpreted from several facets. In the first place, the emergency orders with the average of 18.25% per day, greatly influence the plans and schedules without controlling their releases. Secondly, after adopting the release strategy, 14.42% of orders are controlled averagely without entering into the scheduling level. The orders delivered on time are improved by 24.69% on average. Thirdly, from comparing the total tardiness with and without the strategy, it is observed that, great improvement is achieved. Specifically, 44.46% of tardiness is cut down averagely from this experiment. Finally, the improvement of each order, which means the total processing time of each order, has been reduced by 2.05%. It implies that the production cycle could be shortened without adding extra manufacturing facilities after implementing the release strategy.

Third is evaluating the proposed model by comparing the results from a real-time RFID-driven model with standard SOTs and practical real-life operation data. 12 typical manufacturing stages are extracted for the evaluation. Ten groups of orders from the peak season are used for this evaluation. Table 5
                         illustrates the comparisons of the results obtained from three approaches: ① proposed model in this paper; ② a real-time RFID-driven model [45]; ③ practical operation data.

From Table 5, the experimental results imply that, the proposed model outperforms over our previous presented model and current production mechanism used in the collaborative company. The outperformance could be interpreted as follows. First of all, orders on time under the three manners are 92.4%, 85.1% and 60.5% respectively on average. The proposed model in this paper improves the orders on time by 31.9%, which means the productivity could be explored by the percentage approximately. Secondly, the processing time per order is averagely cut down by 7 (Unite of time) (66.05 vs 73.05) and 14.2 (66.05 vs 80.25). The reduced time directly brings the improvement production efficiency. Finally, the total tardiness from each manner are 441.2, 574.5 and 768.8, with the difference of 327.6 averagely. The difference, also regarded as the improved margin, reflect the quality of production decisions with less delayed jobs.


                        Fig. 5
                         presents a statistics analysis of scheduled jobs in the typical production stages. The x-axis is each stage and y-axis is the processing time (Min). Each dot represents an average value of specific stage (process). It can be observed that, the proposed model performs better than the other two approaches at most of the stage. The mean values of the total processing time of a job (
                           
                              ∑
                              PT
                           
                        ) from these three method are 393, 420 and 440, which indicate the shortening of processing time by 6.43% and 10.68% respectively. It is found that the processing time of a job within these stages could be reduced by almost 10% when using the concept in this paper comparing with current production mode. The reasons why the proposed model is superior to the other two are: (1) this model uses a practical and reasonable prediction model for forecasting the production order arrivals; (2) order release strategy is used for controlling the emergency jobs so that orders on time are improved; (3) processing times for each operator are determined given their skill levels and working shift so that this model can work out more better decisions.

Fourth is evaluating the model under several disturbances such as defects, machine breakdown and emergency orders. Two problem sizes are used for testing the re-planning and re-scheduling adaptability, which is the model robustness that reflects the ability of a system to resist change. Fig. 6
                         presents the experimental results. From the above diagram, with problem size of 10, it can be observed that the machine breakdown largely affect the processing time; while the model performs well to address the situation of defects and emergency orders. Quantitatively, machine breakdown causes enormous tardiness of jobs from the evaluation. From the bottom diagram, with problem size of 27, it can be observed that emergency order and machine breakdown greatly influence the processing time with the total tardiness of 313 and 289 respectively. However, defects’ influences are relatively weak in such case. It is interesting to find that, the model used in the RFID-enabled ubiquitous manufacturing environment is able to address the defects issues. Real-time information and RFID-event driven production mechanism may attribute to the improved product quality since all the manufacturing objects are traced and tracked on a real-time basis.

Findings and observations from the above experiments and analysis could be converted into managerial implications, which may be useful in supporting or facilitating the daily operations of different decision makers to achieve collective intelligence.

The estimations of the production order arrivals use LSPT and Poisson process to find out their precise probability distributions. Using these distributions, decision makers are able to predict a reasonable prospect, in which resolutions may be much more accurate and practical. Based on the prospect, further advanced decisions like investment on manufacturing facilities and expansion of production could be puzzled out.

A rich set of rules is widely used for making decisions within the RFID-enabled ubiquitous manufacturing environment. The sequence of these rules could greatly affect the plans and schedules. The examined results from this paper may guide decision makers to pick up suitable rules with reasonable sequence to obtain optimal results.

The release strategy for controlling the number of production orders in a two-level production planning and scheduling is significant. Planners from production department may make decisions according to the strategy which real-timely considers the machine capacity at different manufacturing stages. Using this strategy, plans and schedules will not be less disturbed by the frequent releasing operations. WIP inventory in the manufacturing sites could be reduced since the total tardiness of jobs are significantly cut down.

The proposed concepts in this paper not only suit the process industry, but also support other manufacturing sectors such as discrete industry. Since the manufacturing objects are turned into SMOs through RFID technology, production operations and decision-makings are facilitated within the RFID-enabled ubiquitous environments. Additionally, decisions like plans and schedules are based on real-time information of SMOs, leading to adaptive production management and ultimately collective intelligence.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

This paper considers an advanced production planning and scheduling (APPS) model which is specifically designed for the RFID-enabled real-time ubiquitous manufacturing environment. This model uses more precise input such as production order arrival and standard operation times (SOTs) to improve the quality and reliability of plans and schedules to achieve collective intelligence. A solution framework based on heuristic approach which uses a set of rules is proposed to solve the problem. Experiments are carried out to examine the precise probability of production order arrival and evaluate the proposed model and compare the results with practical decision-making results. The experimental results show the outperformance of the proposed model over another model and practical executions from manual and rule-based operations.

Several contributions are significant. The model inputs – production orders are precisely examined through two dimensions. The long-term aspect with exponential distribution is to examine the trends yearly. The short-term aspect with Poisson process is to examine their arrivals hourly. After the examination, inputs into the model are more reasonable and practical, which leads to better decisions. Moreover, the proposed model enables real-time interactions within production planning and scheduling level through RFID event-driven mechanism. A heuristic-based solution framework is proposed for solving the problem. Specifically, a set of rules is used for this purpose. These rules are tested under various conditions so that which rules should be used in which situations could be determined. That is significant in real-world cases because human intervenes are necessary for some special considerations such as tasks re-arrangement under emergencies like machine breakdown or particular technical requirements. Finally, this approach upgrades the traditional hierarchical decision-making mechanism into a closed-loop fashion, where real-time information from scheduling level could be fed back to planning level. Ultimate APPS is enabled by the real-time RFID event driven principle twining with hybrid flow shop (HFS) scheduling. That is really able to enable the collective intelligence using real-time RFID data in the ubiquitous manufacturing environment.

Future research directions could be carried out in several dimensions. This model could be extended through considering the logistics within the RFID-enabled ubiquitous manufacturing environment. The objective, considering the WIP inventory, could be to minimize the total inventory cost so that operations could be improved in terms of logistics efficiency and Just-In-Time (JIT) of material delivery. Additionally, comparisons of this proposed model with other conventional approaches for forecasting such as support vector regression, decision tree, and back propagation neural network will be carried out. Logistics trajectory, making full use of the RFID-enabled production data, could be discovered through a Big Data approach. The frequent trajectories, for example tray loading, tray moving, and tray recycling, could be figured out. The invaluable information not only supports for material requirement planning (MRP), but also provides critical supports for evaluating the performance of logistics operators. The concepts and models proposed in this paper could be realized in a decision support system (DSS) which is useful for helping the decision makers such as planners or schedulers for collective intelligence within the RFID-enabled ubiquitous manufacturing environment. Additionally, the executions of decision such as plans and schedules could be real-timely supervised through the RFID technology so that the ultimate collective intelligence APPS will be achieved.
