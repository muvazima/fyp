               Abstract
               
                  The recent developments in the image quality, storage and data transmission capabilities increase the importance of texture analysis, which plays an important role in computer vision and image processing. Local binary pattern (LBP) is an effective statistical texture descriptor, which has successful applications in texture classification. In this paper, two novel descriptors were proposed to search different patterns in images built on LBP. One of them is based on the relations between the sequential neighbors with a specified distance and the other one is based on determining the neighbors in the same orientation through central pixel parameter. These descriptors are tested with the Brodatz-1, Brodatz-2, Butterfly and Kylberg datasets to show the applicability of the proposed nLBP
