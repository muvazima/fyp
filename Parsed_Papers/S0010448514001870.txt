                  A surface in Euclidean space is called ringed (or cyclic) if there exists a one-parameter family of planes that intersects this surface in circles. Well-known examples of ringed surfaces are the surfaces of revolution, (not only rotational) quadrics, canal surfaces, or Darboux cyclides. This paper focuses on modeling with rational ringed surfaces, mainly for blending purposes. We will deal with the question of rationality of ringed surfaces and discuss the usefulness of the so called P-curves for constructing rational ringed-surface-blends. The method of constructing blending surfaces that satisfy certain prescribed constraints, e.g. a necessity to avoid some obstacles, will be presented. The designed approach can be easily modified also for computing 
                        n
                     -way blends. In addition, we will study the contour curves on ringed surfaces and use them for computing approximate parameterizations of implicitly given blends by ringed surfaces. The designed techniques and their implementations are verified on several examples.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper, we will focus on modeling with the ringed (or cyclic) surfaces. They are generated by sweeping a circle with variable radius–which is contained in a plane with a possibly non-constant normal vector–along a directrix curve, see  [1]. Special cases include Darboux cyclides (see  [2]) which can carry up to six families of real circles, see  [3–6]. Ringed surfaces are well suited e.g. for designing pipe structures in plant modeling,  [7,8]. A special method for computing the intersection of two ringed surfaces is described in  [9].

The class of ringed surfaces contains a special subclass of canal surfaces that are obtained as the envelopes of a one-parameter family of spheres, see e.g.  [10,11]. Special cases include pipe surfaces (obtained for spheres of constant radius) and surfaces of revolution (generated by spheres whose centers are located on a given line). Dupin cyclides (defined as the envelopes of all spheres touching three given spheres) form probably the most studied family of canal surfaces  [12–14].

It was proved in  [15,16] that any canal surface with a rational spine curve (which is the curve formed by the centers of the moving spheres) and a rational radius function admits a rational parameterization  [15,16]. An algorithm for generating rational parameterizations of canal surfaces was presented in  [17]. An analogous result was proved also for normal ringed surfaces—in particular a normal ringed surface with rational directrix and a rational radius function is rational, see  [15]. We will extend this result for an arbitrary ringed surface with rational directrix, rational normal vector field and radius function equal to the square root of some non-negative rational function.

The canal surfaces have been studied more thoroughly than the ringed surfaces and one can find many applications in CAD based on canal surfaces. Let us recall, for instance, the operation of blending which is one of the most important operations in Computer-Aided (Geometric) Design. The main purpose of this operation is to generate one or more surfaces that create a smooth joint between the given shapes. Blending surfaces are necessary for rounding edges and corners of mechanical parts, or for smooth connection of separated objects, see e.g.  [18,19] and references therein. Canal surfaces are often used as blending surfaces between two given surfaces  [20–22].

However not for all input shapes (ending with circular profiles), the canal surfaces are suitable as blending primitives. We recall e.g. the case when oblique cones shall be blended—then the ringed surfaces find their straightforward application. Our goal is to investigate the possibility to construct a smooth joint between given shapes by parametric ringed surfaces. In addition, the designed technique will enable us to construct also general 
                        n
                     -way blends between 
                        n
                      ringed surfaces. As the method produces watertight blends the results can be interesting also for Isogeometric Analysis,  [23].

Methods for connecting ringed surfaces by implicit blends were presented in  [24,25]. As known, an exact rational parameterization does not exist for an arbitrary implicitly given algebraic surface. Then, suitable techniques producing approximate parameterizations must be used. Methods for the computation of an approximate parameterization of a implicitly given canal surface obtained as a result of some blending technique were thoroughly studied in  [26,27]. In this paper, we will continue with this approach and present a method for an approximate parameterization of implicitly given ringed-surface-blends.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section summarizes some fundamental facts about ringed surfaces. In Section  3 we deal with the question of rationality of ringed surfaces. The method of constructing blending surfaces by rational ringed surfaces is described in Section  4. In Section  5 we show how such a blending surface can be adjusted to satisfy certain constraints, e.g. when avoiding obstacles is required. In Section  6 we present a short sketch of the construction of 
                        n
                     -way blends and Section  6 is devoted to contour curves on ringed surfaces which are used for computing approximate parameterizations of implicitly given blends by ringed surfaces. Then we conclude the paper.

A ringed surface 
                     
                        R
                     , see Fig. 1
                     , is a surface generated by sweeping a circle centered at a curve 
                        
                           d

                           t
                           )
                        
                     , called the directrix, lying in a plane with the prescribed normal vector 
                        
                           n
                        
                        
                           (
                           t
                           )
                        
                     , called the orientation function, and possessing a radius described by the radius function 
                     
                        ϱ
                        
                           (
                           t
                           )
                        
                     . We shortly write 
                        R
                        :
                        
                           (
                           
                              d
                           
                           ,
                           
                              n
                           
                           ,
                           ϱ
                           )
                        
                        
                           (
                           t
                           )
                        
                     . We will omit the dependence on parameter 
                        t
                      whenever no confusion is likely to arise. When

                              ′
                           
                        
                        =

                      (i.e., the orientation function describes the field of the directrix tangents’ directions) we speak about the normal ringed surfaces, see Fig. 2
                     .

A special subclass of the ringed surfaces is constituted by the so called canal surfaces. A canal surface is defined as the envelope of a one-parameter family of spheres whose centers trace the spine curve 
                     
                        
                           m
                        
                      and possess the radii described by the radius function 
                     
                        r
                     . The canal surfaces with constant radius function are called pipe surfaces.

Every canal surface is a ringed surfaces with

                               According to results from  [31], where a similar condition was thoroughly discussed, we can prove that Eq. (19) has a real solution for all quadratic orientation functions. To sum up, for any quadratic curve there exists a plane going through the origin such that the projected curve is a planar P-curve.

In this section we will present how the curve 
                           
                              f

In  [16,32] a similar equation to (6), which is a crucial step for the computation of a rational parameterization of pipe/canal and also normal ringed surfaces, is solved and discussed. Here, we exploit and follow the idea introduced in  [16]. The solution of (6) is a curve

                           r
                        . Such a canal surface is rational, see  [16]. Nevertheless, considering it as a ringed surface

                           :

                         is polynomial. Our goal is to find a rational curve 
                           
                              f

                         we can construct a corresponding rational curve on

                      and its rational parameterization can be computed by the SOS decomposition (which is solvable only numerically, in general). However, as indicated in Propositions 3.1 and 3.2, using some special curves (when interpolating (37)) will make the computation of the parameterization of the blending ringed surface considerably easier as it allows to avoid the SOS decomposition. Let us discuss this approach in more detail.

                     , by a P-curve we immediately obtain a curve with the polynomial norm and fulfilling the condition on orthogonality. So we will focus on this part of the interpolation more thoroughly. The interpolation by polynomial P-curves is based on solving quadratic quaternion equations as in the case of spatial PH curves, see  [29].

                     , can be interpolated by an arbitrary rational curve.

Nevertheless, Proposition 3.2 offers even an easier way. It is enough to interpolate 2-dimensional data (sampled from the projection of the orientation functions to a coordinate plane) by a planar P-curve. This can be done by solving “only” complex quadratic equations. The remaining coordinate of the orientation function together with the directrix and the radius function will be obtained via the interpolation by some rational curve. Thus, we will interpolate

                      As in the case of interpolating by planar PH quintics it can be shown that the “more suitable” interpolant is the one with

                      interpolation by planar P-curve is simple and straightforward since it is enough to substitute given Hermite data (in the form of the complex representation of points in the plain) to (43) and obtain the solution. A main drawback of this approach is that the resulting P-curve has degree 6, which could be for some applications considered as too high.

However, the degree of the interpolant can be reduced by using P-biarcs, which is a method successfully used for PH curves e.g. in  [34,35]. In particular we construct two quartic P-curves

                            We interpolate data (38) by the Ferguson’s cubic and data (39) by the planar P-curve of degree six and compute the corresponding rational parameterization of the resulting ringed surface, see Fig. 3
                           .


                     
                        Remark 4.2
                        We would like to emphasize that using ringed surfaces for the operation of blending significantly extends the family of surfaces (and their mutual positions) which can be blended. For instance, the surfaces from Example 4.1 have to be blended by (non-canal) ringed surface as they are not canal surfaces. Moreover, even when we want to construct blends between two specially situated canal surfaces it may occur a position which cannot be successfully solved by a canal-surface-blend but it is possible to find a suitable ringed-surface-blend, see Fig. 4
                           .

In  [22,31], the so called contour curves (see Definition 7.1) on canal surfaces were investigated and used for constructing a whole family of canal surfaces sharing the same silhouette with respect to a parallel projection while only one SOS decomposition was necessary to be found for the computation of their parameterizations. This approach is especially useful for constructing blends satisfying certain constraints, e.g. when avoiding obstacles or bypassing other objects is required. The constructed blending surface can be easily modified only with the help of a certain distance function, see  [31] for more details.

When using ringed surfaces for constructing blends with constraints, the situation is significantly easier (without involving contour curves)—the contour curves on ringed surfaces will be discussed in Section  7. The key step of the computation of a parameterization of a curve on a ringed surface 
                        R
                      (and thus also a parameterization of 
                        R
                     ) is the computation of the unit rational vector field 
                        
                           f
                        
                      orthogonal to the orientation function

                      (cf. (6)). This can be done by decomposing a polynomial/rational function into a sum of squares or by modeling with P-curves. However, this computation step does not depend on the directrix 
                        
                           d
                        
                      and therefore 
                        
                           d
                        
                      could be adjusted as the prescribed constraints require. In particular, we construct a new directrix

The shape variability (especially suitable for modeling purposes) of ringed surfaces can be used when e.g. one wants to optimize (in some sense) the shape of the already constructed blend. As a particular example, we choose a criterion that the shape of the modified blend is as close as possible to the shape of a normal ringed surface. This is a natural criterion from the point of view of practical applications as we would like to avoid the situations when the normals

The presented approach starts with the computation of a blending ringed surface. So, we have the directrix

                            yielding a blending ringed surface which is “more normal” than the original one, see Fig. 9
                           . In particular the deviance of the tangents of the directrix from the vectors of the orientation function measured by integral (58) is improved from 0.337 to 0.112.

In this section, we will deal with the problem of constructing a blending surface between three or more ringed surfaces. The method is based on choosing an auxiliary sphere and separately constructing blending ringed surfaces between the given ringed surfaces and the sphere by the methods discussed in the previous sections.

Consider the (parts of the) three ringed surfaces

                        Remark 6.1
                        Let us note that in the construction of the multiple blends the position and the radius of the auxiliary sphere (and even the circles on the sphere at which the blend surfaces join it) can be chosen freely (only some natural criteria must be satisfied). Hence the multiple blends can be easily modified according to further prescribed requirements reflecting additional modeling conditions.

Analogously, we can construct general 
                        n
                     -way blends between 
                        n
                      ringed surfaces; Fig. 11
                      presents 5-way blend between five given ringed surfaces.

We start with investigating contour curves on ringed surfaces and then we focus on computing approximate parameterizations of implicitly given ringed surfaces gained e.g. by some implicit blending techniques.

                              R

                      corresponds to the silhouette of the given ringed surface when projecting it to the plane with the normal vector

                     . Without loss of generality, we may assume in what follows that 
                        
                           v
                        
                      is a unit vector. We recall that studying projected contour curves (silhouettes) do not only help to create a first visual perception of the shape of the studied object but they have also many practical applications—for instance, in reconstruction of the 3D object from a 2D image, in rendering, in computing the visible area, when deleting invisible curves, see  [36–38].

Contrary to canal surfaces, the expression of contour curves for a general ringed surface is more complicated and contains even nested square roots. More precisely, a parameterization of the contour curve with respect to the vector 
                        
                           v
                        
                      can be computed as the envelope of the family of ellipses obtained by projecting the family of sweeping circles

Nonetheless, studying the resulting parametric expression in more detail is beyond the scope of this paper. Here we only consider some special cases (special ringed surfaces) having the contour curves without nested square roots in their parametric expressions. One of the special situation occurs when the ellipses (projected characteristic circles in the projection

                           . Then 
                           
                              R

                        Corollary 7.3
                        
                           Any normal ringed surface with the directrix being a quadratic PH curve possesses a rational contour curve.
                        

The usefulness of the contour curves on ringed surfaces can be demonstrated on the problem of approximating implicitly given blends by a rational ringed surface. Let be given two normal ringed surfaces

                     . Now, a practical problem can be formulated as follows: Construct a rational approximation of this implicitly given blending surface by some suitable rational ringed surface.

We recall that in  [26] a method for computing approximate parameterizations of implicitly given canal surfaces based on approximating their contour curves by polynomial cubics was introduced and in  [27] improved. The algorithm from  [27] starts with computing the polynomial cubic approximate parameterizations of three different contour curves of the given canal surface 
                        S
                     . From these parameterizations an approximation of the spine curve (also polynomial of degree 3) of 
                        S
                      is reconstructed and consequently an approximate parameterization of 
                        S
                      is computed.

An analogous approach can be used for computing approximate parameterizations of implicitly given ringed surfaces. We also (approximately) parameterize three different contour curves on the given ringed surface 
                        B
                      and reconstruct an approximation of the directrix and the orientation function from these parameterizations.

In the case of canal surfaces the contour curves possess a special feature—in particular for a contour curve

                      However, this advantageous feature is not satisfied for general ringed surfaces. So one can ask: Why to use the contour curves (in the case of ringed surfaces) while any arbitrary curve on 
                        B
                      can be used instead with the same effect? Nonetheless the answer is simple: When a ringed surface is given by its implicit equation 
                        f

                      then the contour curve with respect to

                        When the blend, which shall be approximated, is of a more complex shape, then the refinement can be done to increase the accuracy. The input blending surface is divided into a suitable number of parts by cutting it by planes

                        Remark 7.5
                        Let us note that it is enough to use only two contour curves in the parameterization process. Since contour curves possess two branches in general, we can work with the two real branches

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we studied a rationality of ringed surfaces (given by the rational directrix curve, and rational orientation and radius functions) from the point of view of their applicability for computing rational blends between parts of surfaces ending with circular profiles. Several sufficient conditions which guarantee that a computed parameterization of the ringed surface is rational were formulated. A main criterion was simplicity of consequent implementations of the considered rational techniques. Our results extend the analogous results about rational canal surfaces, studied in CAD/CAGD more thoroughly than the ringed surfaces. Nonetheless, not for all input shapes ending with circular profiles (e.g. oblique cones) are canal surfaces suitable as blending primitives so it is worth considering ringed surfaces in some situations instead. We designed an approach that can be applied not only for the construction of a smooth joint between two given shapes but can be immediately modified also for computing 
                        n
                     -way blends. In addition, we shortly investigated also the contour curves on ringed surfaces and used them on the practical problem of parameterizing implicit blends consisting of parts of ringed (or ringed-surface-like) surfaces (e.g. as an analogy to similar approach to implicitly given canal surfaces).
