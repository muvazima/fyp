                  Three approaches are commonly used for analyzing decisions under uncertainty: expected utility (EU), second-degree stochastic dominance (SSD), and mean-risk (MR) models, with the mean–standard deviation (MS) being the best-known MR model. Because MR models generally lead to different efficient sets and thus are a continuing source of controversy, the specific concern of this article is not to suggest another MR model. Instead, we show that the SSD- and MR-efficient sets are identical, as long as (a) the risk measure satisfies both positive homogeneity and consistency with respect to the Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) definition(s) of increasing risk and (b) the choice set includes the riskless asset and satisfies a generalized location and scale property, which can be interpreted as a market model. Under these conditions, there is no controversy among MR models and they all have a decision-theoretic foundation. They also offer a convenient way to compare the estimation error related to the empirical implementation of different MR models.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Modern decision theory under uncertainty plays a fundamental role in finance and in fields such as economics, psychology, operational research, and management science. A leading example, perhaps because enormous amounts of money are invested in financial markets, is the problem of choosing between investment alternatives or portfolios with uncertain returns (Bawa, 1975). Three approaches are commonly used to make such decisions: expected utility (EU), stochastic dominance (SD) and mean-risk (MR) analysis. Expected utility theory is a pillar of modern decision theory (Krokhmal, Zabarankin, & Uryasev, 2011). The closely related concept of SD belongs to the most widely accepted decision-making models (Aumann & Serrano, 2008). No widely accepted MR model, however, has been found to date (Farinelli & Tibiletti, 2008).

The best-known MR model dating back to the pioneering work of Markowitz (1952) is the mean–standard deviation (MS) approach, which is often criticized because it is, in general, not consistent with SD rules (Ogryczak & Ruszczyński, 1999). Since a MR model is easily obtained from the MS model by replacing the standard deviation with an alternative risk measure, the literature on MR models is potentially as diverse as the literature on risk measures.
                        1
                        
                           Krokhmal et al. (2011), Ortobelli, Rachev, Stoyanov, Fabozzi, and Biglova (2005), Szegö (2005), and Pedersen and Satchell (1998) provide overviews of risk measures.
                     
                     
                        1
                      Important MR models have been suggested and analyzed by Roy (1952), Porter (1974), Bawa (1975, 1978), Fishburn (1977), Yitzhaki (1982), Konno and Yamazaki (1991), Ogryczak and Ruszczyński (1999), Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000), Krokhmal, Palmquist, and Uryasev (2002), Gaivoronski and Pflug (2005), Homm and Pigorsch (2012). From an academic point of view, this diversity of MR models offers a continuing source of controversy and ongoing research. From the practitioner’s point of view, however, diversity is a drawback, because different MR models, in general, lead to different efficient sets (i.e. the set of random alternatives such that no other random alternative dominates them by the specific rule).

This article does not suggest another MR model but rather analyzes a class of models that offers a modest degree of reconciliation among the different models involved in this controversy. Its main contribution is to suggest sufficient conditions under which the second-order stochastic dominance (SSD)-efficient set and all MR-efficient sets are identical. The implications are clear. If all MR-efficient sets are identical there is no controversy among MR models. Furthermore, if these efficient sets are identical to the SSD-efficient set, all MR models have a decision-theoretic foundation.

We show that the SSD- and MR-efficient sets are identical, if (a) the risk measure satisfies both positive homogeneity and consistency with respect to the Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) definition(s) of increasing risk and (b) the choice set includes the riskless asset and satisfies a generalized location and scale (LS) property. Thus, if an investor uses different performance measures such as Omega, Sortino or Kappa (as defined in Eling & Schuhmacher, 2007), he always obtains the same efficient set if these investment alternatives satisfy the generalized LS property. This is because these performance measures are based on lower partial moment risk metrics that, in general, fulfill both positive homogeneity and consistency with respect to Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970).

In addition to supplying a decision-theoretic foundation for certain MR models, our theoretical conditions provide a convenient setup for comparing estimation errors of performance measures related to different MR models. Suppose we want to rank N investment funds according to different performance measures. Our main result implies that if all performance measures are estimated without any estimation error, then all performance measures rank the N investments funds identically. This means that the rank correlations between two arbitrary performance measures are equal to 1. Our main result also implies that if the performance measures are estimated with estimation error, other performance measures might rank the N investment funds in a different way, and the more different the rankings are (i.e. the rank correlation coefficients), the higher the estimation errors of the performance measures are. Using this idea in a small simulation study, we find that partial moment-based performance measures show lower estimation error than measures based on the Value-at-Risk (VaR) or the conditional VaR (CVaR). We also find that the simple and elegant performance measure recently proposed by Homm and Pigorsch (2012) is characterized by low estimation error comparable to the results for the partial moment-based metrics.

To demonstrate our contribution to the literature, our article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review that highlights previous theoretical results with special relevance for our results and proofs. Section 3 suggests sufficient conditions under which the SSD- and MR-efficient sets are identical. Section 3.1 describes the setup, especially the choice set and the generalized LS condition. Section 3.2 discusses the empirical relevance of the generalized LS property. Because the MS is the best-known MR model, Section 3.3 shows that the MS- and SSD-efficient sets are identical under the generalized LS condition. Section 3.4 then shows that MR- and MS-efficient sets are identical, as long as the risk measure satisfies both positive homogeneity and consistency with respect to Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970). Section 4 provides a small simulation study analyzing the estimation error of selected MR models. Section 5 concludes.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Before summarizing the relevant literature, it seems helpful to briefly and informally define the relevant concepts. (More formal definitions are given in Section 3.1.) A random variable V
                     1 dominates the random variable V
                     2 according to the EU rule if the expected utility from V
                     1 is weakly greater than the expected utility from V
                     2 for all non-decreasing risk-averse utility functions. The random variable V
                     1 dominates the random variable V
                     2 according to the first-degree SD rule, if the cumulative probability of V
                     1 is weakly smaller than the cumulative probability of V
                     2. The random variable V
                     1 dominates the random variable V
                     2 according to second-degree SD, if the sum of the cumulative probabilities for all returns is never more with V
                     1 than V
                     2 and sometimes less. The random variable V
                     1 dominates the random variable V
                     2 according to the MS rule, if V
                     1 has a higher mean and a lower standard deviation with at least one strict inequality.

The research on the identification of conditions that lead to the equivalence of EU-, SD- and MR-decision rules can be divided into four groups. The first group – probably the largest and oldest – analyzes EU-rules, SD-rules and the relationship between the two. Levy (1992) gives a comprehensive survey and analysis of the seminal literature in this field, and he also discusses a result that is central to our article, namely the equivalence between the EU-rule for non-decreasing risk-averse utility functions and the SSD-rule: A random variable X
                     
                        i
                      second-degree stochastically dominates another random variable X
                     
                        j
                      if and only if EU(X
                     
                        i
                     )⩾EU(X
                     
                        j
                     ) for all utility functions U with U′⩾0 and U″⩽0.

The second group – as old as the first – consists of articles analyzing conditions which imply consistency between EU and MS utility functions. Meyer and Rasche (1992) review this topic and, more importantly, provide the sufficient conditions which imply consistency between EU and MS utility functions. These sufficient conditions generalize the LS property (Meyer, 1987; Sinn, 1983) and are thus called generalized LS property. Unfortunately, the MS utility functions V(μ
                     
                        i
                     , σ
                     
                        i
                     )=EU(X
                     
                        i
                     ) derived under the generalized LS property do not have the same “nice” properties as the utility functions derived under the LS condition. For example, they may not satisfy the fundamental property ∂V/∂μ
                     ⩾0 for all U′⩾0 and U″⩽0. This and other problems with the MS utility functions might explain why the generalized LS condition is not as well-known and analyzed as the LS property. Nevertheless, the generalized LS property is the central assumption of this paper, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that analyzes this condition in more detail and in the context of other MR models.

The third and probably most diverse group comprises articles suggesting MR models consistent with SD. Ogryczak and Ruszczyński (1999) review SD and MR models. The articles from this group suggest and justify MR models. These articles do not analyze the question under which conditions the different MR models lead to identical efficient sets.

The fourth group is the smallest and most pertinent to our article. It contains articles providing a modest degree of reconciliation among MR models. To the best of our knowledge, it consists of only two articles, one by Chen, He, and Zhang (2011) and the other by Schuhmacher and Eling (2012).
                        2
                        Other papers that are close in spirit are by Kroll, Levy, and Markowitz (1984) and Grootveld and Hallerbach (1999).
                     
                     
                        2
                      The first one proves that eleven reward-to-risk performance measures are all monotonic transformations of the Sharpe ratio, when the underlying random returns of assets to be combined are multivariate elliptically distributed. The second one shows that any “admissible” performance measure is a strictly increasing function in the Sharpe ratio, when the underlying distributions of a given set of portfolio alternatives satisfy the LS property of Sinn (1983) and Meyer (1987).
                        3
                        It can be shown that the results of the two articles are linked by the findings of Owen and Rabinovitch (1983). As a consequence, the result of Chen et al. (2011) can be considered a special case of Schuhmacher and Eling (2012).
                     
                     
                        3
                     
                  

It is assumed that the investors’ choice sets consist of one riskless asset and n risky assets, which are interpreted as investment funds. The investors can combine each risky asset with the riskless asset. Hence, the decision problem consists of choosing both the optimal risky asset and the optimal combination between the optimal risky asset and the riskless asset.

It is assumed that the set of excess rates of return X
                        
                           i
                         (i
                        =1,…,
                        n) of all n investment funds, where excess returns are defined as the differences of the funds’ returns to the return of a riskless asset, satisfies the generalized LS property. According to Meyer and Rasche (1992, p. 94), the random variables X
                        
                           i
                         satisfy the generalized LS property if they can be written as

For the interpretation of Eq. (1), it is useful to compare it with the market model (Bodie, Kane, & Marcus, 2011, p. 323), which is often used to test the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965). The market model can be stated as X

                        =0. This highlights that the generalized LS model with c
                        =0, used in the remainder of our article, can be interpreted as a market model. In the market model, the mean of Y is positive. In addition, we assume a
                        
                           i
                        
                        >0 for all i, which is equivalent to the assumption that all investment funds have positive mean excess rates of return. Otherwise, no risk-averse investor would invest in such a fund.
                           4
                           Hence, the assumptions of a positive mean of Y and a
                              
                                 i
                              
                              >0 are no serious limitations of the model. We can also have a negative mean of Y combined with a
                              
                                 i
                              
                              <0. The important aspect is that we obtain positive mean excess returns that motivate investors to hold the funds.
                        
                        
                           4
                         It is important to note that Y can be distributed with positive or negative skewness or fat tails. There is almost no restriction on the distribution of Y except that the first two moments have to exist. Another important point is that the Z
                        
                           i
                         do not have to be independent from each other. As in Meyer (1987, p. 423), the means and variances of the random variables are assumed to be finite. As in Levy (1989, p. 598), the endpoints of the interval containing the support of X
                        
                           i
                         can be finite or infinite.

                        , where m
                        >0 is the weight of the risky asset. Obviously all X

                        Meyer and Rasche (1992) suggest the generalized LS model because it leads to MS utility functions. They show that the expected utility from investment X
                        
                           i
                         for an investor with utility function U can be written as EU(X
                        
                           i
                        )=
                        V(μ
                        
                           i
                        , σ
                        
                           i
                        ) with ∂V/∂σ
                        ⩽0 for U′⩾0 and U″⩽0, where μ
                        
                           i
                         and σ
                        
                           i
                         are the mean and the standard deviation of the random variable X
                        
                           i
                        . Since all linear combinations between a risky and a riskless asset satisfy the generalized LS property as well, this statement is also true for any random variable X
                        
                           i,m
                        . It is interesting to note, that as in Chamberlain (1983) increasing the mean can decrease the MS utility, i.e. ∂V/∂μ
                        <0. However, this is not critical for our results because a riskless asset is included in the choice set.

                              Chamberlain (1983) states that “For our class of distributions, however, an increasing, concave utility function U does not necessarily imply that EU is an increasing function of the portfolio’s mean. Nevertheless, the separation results hold.”

The MS-efficient set for the investor’s decision problem is known to consist of all linear combinations between the riskless asset and the investment fund with the highest Sharpe ratio (Wong & Ma, 2008), which is characterized by the lowest quotient b

                           i
                         and the corresponding performance measure P

                         is defined for ρ

This EU-rule is equivalent to the SSD-rule (Levy, 1992). Hence, the EU- and SSD-efficient sets are identical. It remains to compare the MS-efficient set with the EU- or the SSD-efficient set (Section 3.3) and to compare the MS-efficient set with the MR-efficient set (Section 3.4).

A critical point of the LS condition is that all investment funds presumably have the same skewness and the same kurtosis (Schuhmacher, 2012, Appendix 1). This assumption is inconsistent with the observation that investment funds often have different skewness and kurtosis (Homm & Pigorsch, 2012). To weaken this critique, our article is based on the generalized LS condition as defined by Meyer and Rasche (1992). It allows for cross-sectional differences in skewness and kurtosis (Schuhmacher, 2012, Appendix 2) and thus can be considered the more realistic condition.

As noted in Section 3.1, the generalized LS condition can be interpreted as a market model that explains excess returns by a single common factor. This means that our theoretical results can provide an explanation for the high observable rank correlation among a variety of performance measures (Eling, 2008; Eling & Schuhmacher, 2007) if such a common factor exists.

Previous literature on the empirical validity of the CAPM shows that the risk premium of a market portfolio (usually proxied by a broad stock market index) cannot be considered a suitable factor for explaining or forecasting all of the empirically observable excess return behavior (Banz, 1981; Basu, 1977; Fama & French, 1992, 1993; Lettau & Ludvigson, 2001b; Shanken, 1985). Nevertheless, Meyer and Rasche (1992) test the generalized LS condition based on a model with a market portfolio factor. They find that the generalized LS condition cannot be rejected in their dataset. However, they also point out that this is to be expected in small samples and that for conditions of such generality a large number of observations is required for a rejection to occur.

Thus, testing of the generalized LS condition (which is beyond the scope of this article) based on larger sample sizes and more adequate factors might shed more light on its empirical validity. Alternative factors for this purpose could be found in the literature that emerged in response to the empirical failure of the CAPM. Here, researchers have concentrated on identifying and analyzing other candidate variables such as lagged returns, the dividend-to-price ratio, the earnings-to-price ratio, the book-to-market ratio, the dividend payout ratio, the share of equity in new finance, yield spreads between long- and short-term interest rates and between low- and high-quality bond yields, and recent changes in short-term interest rates (Campbell, 2000). These capital market variables provide higher explanatory power than a classic market portfolio factor but are inferior to a new class of macroeconomic variables that stems from the field of consumption-based asset pricing. Here, more variables than ever are being identified that are more closely related to the business cycle and predict countercyclical variation in returns. The most prominent variable in this new class is probably the consumption–wealth ratio (estimated as the cointegration residual in the long-run relation between consumption, asset holdings and labor income) proposed by Lettau and Ludvigson (2001a). In terms of statistical significance and R
                        2 it proves a better forecaster than the dividend yield, the dividend payout ratio, and several other popular variables. Similar and even more impressive results can be observed for the labor income to consumption ratio and the housing share in consumption expenditures used by Santos and Veronesi (2006) and Piazzesi, Schneider, and Tuzel (2007), respectively.

                           In a recent article, closely related to the field of consumption-based asset pricing, Adrian, Etula, and Muir (2013) highlight that a single-factor model based on the marginal value of financial intermediaries’ wealth has explanatory power comparable to traditional multi-factor models using size, book-to-market and momentum variables.

However, the drawback of all the factors the literature has identified so far, is that even though some of them are highly promising, none of them can be considered as the single common factor that is can explain all of the observable excess return behavior. The variables tend to enhance explanatory power as additional variables in multi-factor models but do not persuade in a single-factor context because in single-factor models large parts of the excess return variation remain unaccounted for. However, some recent developments in the econometric literature may help to identify a suitable common factor. Ludvigson and Ng (2007, 2009) propose a procedure that summarizes the information in a large number of time-series with a few estimated dynamic factors. In the context of the generalized method of moments this helps to avoid degrees-of-freedom problems that arise with the inclusion of a large number of instrumental variables in estimation problems with naturally limited sample sizes. In our case, this procedure offers an interesting starting point for the construction of a suitable common factor and thus an interesting topic of related future research.

It is also important to note that the literature discussed so far focuses on explaining excess return variation in stock and bond markets. Most of the factors identified in this literature have not been considered in an investment fund context. Thus, it is unknown whether they could be a suitable common factor in the explanation of funds excess returns. The few factors that have been used in empirical regression models (e.g. the book-to-market ratio) do not provide a full explanation of fund excess return behavior (Capocci & Hübner, 2004). The same argument holds for factors that have been specifically designed for the analysis of funds returns (e.g. factors based on fund return characteristics such as skewness and kurtosis; Ding & Shawky, 2007).

In this section, we identify the conditions that lead to identical MS- and SSD-efficient sets. The following proposition states these conditions and the corresponding proof shows their adequacy.
                           Proposition 1
                           
                              The MS-efficient set is identical to the SSD-efficient set provided that the choice set includes the riskless asset and satisfies the generalized LS property.
                           

The proof consists of three parts. In the first part, we show that every element in the MS-inefficient set is in the SSD-inefficient set. In the second part, we show that any element in the MS-efficient set is not SSD-dominated by another element in the MS-efficient set. In the third part, we show that any element in the MS-efficient set is not SSD-dominated by another element in the MS-inefficient set. For simplicity, we assume that investment fund 1 is the one with the highest Sharpe ratio (i.e. the lowest quotient b

                              ). In all three parts, we use the fact that the MS-efficient set consists of all combinations between the riskless asset and investment fund 1 (i.e. X

                        >0. It follows by assumption that the random variable X
                        1,m
                         has a greater mean than X
                        1,n
                        . Because a necessary condition for SSD-dominating another random variable is having a greater mean than the other random variable (Levy, 1992, p. 572), it is impossible that X
                        1,n
                         SSD-dominates X
                        1,m
                        . It follows also by assumption that X
                        1,m
                         has the lowest observation. Because an element cannot SSD-dominate if it has the lowest observation (Levy, 1992, p. 572), it is impossible that X
                        1,m
                         SSD-dominates X
                        1,n

                           i
                        . It follows from Part 1 that there is an element from the MS-efficient set X
                        1,n
                         which SSD-dominates the element X
                        
                           i,m
                        , which means that X
                        1,n
                         has a greater expected utility than X
                        
                           i,m
                         for all risk-averse U. Since X
                        1,n
                         and X
                        1,k
                         are two elements from the MS-efficient set, it follows from Part 2 that there exists a utility function U
                        ∗ for which the element X
                        1,k
                         has a greater expected utility than X
                        1,n
                        . From the last two sentences it follows that for the utility function U
                        ∗ the expected utility from X
                        1,k
                         is greater than the expected utility from X
                        
                           i,m
                        . Hence it is impossible that X
                        
                           i,m
                         SSD-dominates X
                        1,k
                        . This finishes the proof of Part 3 and the proof of Proposition 1. □

In order to prove our main result, the risk measure needs to satisfy two conditions. The first condition is positive homogeneity, which requires ρ(k
                        ·
                        X
                        
                           i
                        )=
                        k
                        ·
                        ρ
                        
                           i
                         for all k
                        >0 and ρ(0)=0. Positive homogeneity is a property of most axiomatic systems (Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, & Heath, 1999; Aumann & Serrano, 2008; Kijima & Ohnishi, 1993; Pedersen & Satchell, 1998; Rockafellar, Uryasev, & Zabarankin, 2006).

The second condition the risk measure needs to satisfy can be called consistency with respect to the Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) definition(s) of increasing risk.
                           9

                              2 is weaker than monotonicity with respect to second-order stochastic dominance, because it is defined for a specific relation between the random variables X
                              1 and X
                              2.

According to Ortobelli et al. (2005) most risk measures satisfy both positive homogeneity and consistency with respect to Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970).

In order to prove the main result, the following three lemmas are needed. The first lemma describes an important consequence of positive homogeneity.

                        Proposition 2 is important because it implies that a positive homogenous performance measure is a function of the Sharpe ratio. The central question, which will be answered next, is under what conditions it is an increasing function of the Sharpe ratio.

                        Proposition 3 is our main result. It shows that for all risk measures that satisfy positive homogeneity and consistency with respect to the Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) definition(s) of increasing risk, the corresponding performance measure is a strictly increasing function in the Sharpe ratio. Hence, investment fund 1 has the highest Sharpe ratio if and only if it has the highest value of all other admissible performance measures. This means that the efficient sets are identical.

An important implication of Proposition 3 is the following: If a set of investment funds satisfies the generalized LS condition, the performance ranking of these funds will be the same regardless of whether it is conducted via the Sharpe ratio or via any other admissible performance measure. The following simulation study illustrates this proposition with the help of 10 hypothetical investment funds which are ranked according to the Sharpe ratio and seven alternative performance measures. These alternative measures are the well-known Omega, Sortino, Kappa3, VaR, CVaR, and modified Sharpe ratios (as defined by Eling & Schuhmacher, 2007) and an interesting new performance measure recently proposed by Homm and Pigorsch (2012) that measures risk on the basis of the Aumann and Serrano (2008) economic index of riskiness (EIR).

Our simulation study assumes that the excess returns of the 10 investment funds satisfy the generalized LS condition. In detail, the random variable Y follows the t-location-scale distribution and the random variables Z

We see that the excess returns of our funds are characterized by mildly negative skewness and large kurtosis. Thus, clear deviations from a normal distribution can be observed.

Simulating 10 million excess return realizations for each fund shows that indeed all performance measures rank the 10 investment funds identically.
                        10
                        For full transparency, the MATLAB source code of our simulations is available upon request.
                     
                     
                        10
                      Thus, in very large samples, the choice of performance measure does not matter if the generalized LS condition holds and the performance measures satisfy the conditions stated in Section 3.4.

As noted by Auer and Schuhmacher (2013), sample sizes and related estimation error have a crucial impact on whether we can observe identical rankings in empirical datasets. In order to shed more light on this issue and to compare the estimation error of our selected performance measures, we extend our simulation study in the following direction: For every fund, we simulate 240 excess returns (monthly data for 20years) based on the generalized LS distributions specified above and calculate the correlation between the ranks derived from the resulting empirical Omega and the theoretical Sharpe ratio. We then repeat these simulations and calculations 100,000 times in order to obtain the sampling distribution of the rank correlation coefficient.
                        11
                        Qualitatively similar results can be obtained by using 10,000 or 1,000,0000 repetitions.
                     
                     
                        11
                      Note that the theoretical Sharpe ratio ranking is the theoretically correct ranking. Hence, a rank correlation coefficient close to one means that the empirical Omega produces a nearly correct ranking, a rank correlation coefficient close to zero means that there is no (linear) relationship between the empirical Omega and the correct ranking.

In a similar way, the sampling distributions for the rank correlation coefficient between the theoretical Sharpe ratio and the other empirical performance measures are derived. Additionally, we also obtain the sampling distributions for smaller sample sizes of 144 and 72 excess returns (monthly data for 12 and 6years, respectively). To compare the resulting sampling distributions, Table 3
                      shows their means and standard deviations. Furthermore, it reports 1 minus the empirical cumulative distribution function, i.e., P(R
                     >
                     r)=1−
                     F(r), where R is the random rank correlation coefficient in a sample and r is a specific realization. We select r
                     =0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90 and 0.95.


                     Table 3 has three important implications. First, it shows that the LPM-based performance measures (Omega, Sortino ratio and Kappa 3) are, in a certain sense, easier to estimate than the VaR-based performance measures (VaR ratio, CVaR ratio and modified Sharpe ratio). The following example illustrates this implication. According to the results for a sample size of 240 in Table 3, the probability that the rank correlation between the empirical Omega and the theoretical Sharpe ratio is greater than 0.9 is 58.14%, the probability that the rank correlation between the empirical VaR ratio and theoretical Sharpe ratio is greater than 0.9 is only 41.44%. This means that the empirical Omega ratio delivers with greater probability a nearly correct ranking than the empirical VaR ratio. In this sense, Omega is easier to estimate that the VaR ratio. Similar observations hold for all other correlation coefficients r and all other pairs of LPM- and VaR-based performance measures. Intuitively, the first implication might simply reflect the fact that the VaR-based risk measures are estimated only on the basis of the 1% lowest excess rates of return.

The second implication is that the inclusion of higher moments does not seem to be a key requirement for very high precision. For example, the modified Sharpe ratio and the EIR ratio both consider higher moments, but the Omega ratio that does not consider higher moments shows more favorable properties, i.e., for a sample size of 240, we have P(R
                     
                        MSharpe
                     
                     >0.90)=40.31%<
                     P(R
                     
                        EIR
                     
                     >0.90)=50.67%<
                     P(R
                     
                        Omega
                     
                     >0.90)=58.14 %.

Finally, as to be expected, lower sample sizes increase the estimation error. This manifests itself in the form of lower rank correlation means and probabilities and in the form of higher standard deviations of the sampling distributions. It does not alter our conclusion regarding the superiority of LPM-based measures and the EIR ratio over VaR-based measures in terms of estimation error.

In this article, we showed that under certain mild conditions for performance measures (positive homogeneity and consistency with respect to the Rothschild & Stiglitz (1970) definition(s) of increasing risk), the choice set (inclusion of the riskless asset) and the asset returns (satisfaction of the generalized LS condition) three commonly used decision theoretic frameworks (expected utility, stochastic dominance and mean-risk theory) yield identical efficient sets. This result has the important implication, that all MR models fulfilling these conditions have a decision theoretic foundation and produce the same performance rankings. Thus, our study provides decision-theoretic foundations for a number of partial moment- and VaR-based performance measures under fairly general conditions.

In addition, our simulation study supplementing the theoretical results, arrived at the important result that partial moment-based performance measures and the recently proposed EIR ratio are less subject to estimation error than VaR-based measures. Therefore, they can be considered as the more accurate measures in performance evaluation studies with small sample sizes. Our result also implies that empirical studies comparing the rankings of different performance measures have to take this estimation error into account in order to limit the risk of arriving at misleading conclusions.
