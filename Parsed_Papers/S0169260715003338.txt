                  Background and objective
                  Hypokinetic dysarthria (HD) is a frequent speech disorder associated with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). It affects all dimensions of speech production. One of the most common features of HD is dysprosody that is characterized by alterations of rhythm and speech rate, flat speech melody, and impairment of speech intensity control. Dysprosody has a detrimental impact on speech naturalness and intelligibility.
               
               
                  Methods
                  This paper deals with quantitative prosodic analysis of neutral, stress-modified and rhymed speech in patients with PD. The analysis of prosody is based on quantification of monopitch, monoloudness, and speech rate abnormalities. Experimental dataset consists of 98 patients with PD and 51 healthy speakers. For the purpose of HD identification, sequential floating feature selection algorithm and random forests classifier is used. In this paper, we also introduce a concept of permutation test applied in the field of acoustic analysis of dysarthric speech.
               
               
                  Results
                  Prosodic features obtained from stress-modified reading task provided higher classification accuracies compared to the ones extracted from reading task with neutral emotion demonstrating the importance of stress in speech prosody. Features calculated from poem recitation task outperformed both reading tasks in the case of gender-undifferentiated analysis showing that rhythmical demands can in general lead to more precise identification of HD. Additionally, some gender-related patterns of dysprosody has been observed.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  This paper confirms reduced variation of fundamental frequency in PD patients with HD. Interestingly, increased variability of speech intensity compared to healthy speakers has been detected. Regarding speech rate disturbances, our results does not report any particular pattern. We conclude further development of prosodic features quantifying the relationship between monopitch, monoloudness and speech rate disruptions in HD can have a great potential in future PD analysis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder [1] with the prevalence rate estimated to 1.5% for people aged over 65 years [2]. It was first described in 1817 by James Parkinson in his essay “An Essay on the Shaking Palsy” that provided an overview of the disease in its medical context. Parkinson himself referred to it as paralysis agitans and the term Parkinson's Disease was established later by Jean-Martin Charcot in 1876. PD is a chronic idiopathic disorder with the unknown aetiology that is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in substancia nigra pars compacta 
                     [3].

Deficiency of dopamine is a major cause of parkinsonian symptoms [4]. It leads to malfunction of the central nervous system that can no longer co-ordinate muscle movements appropriately resulting in variety of associated motor and non-motor deficits that significantly reduce the quality of life of patients with PD. In addition to motor symptoms manifested predominantly on upper and lower extremities such as resting tremor, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity [3] and postural instability, patients with PD also develop behavioural alternations, reduction of cognitive abilities and the previous studies showed that one of the most frequent manifestations of PD is a multi-modal disruption of motor speech realization commonly referred to as hypokinetic dysarthria (HD) [5]. The latest studies of PD report that speech disorders are amongst the earliest indicators of PD onset. Furthermore it has been estimated that approximately 60–90% of patients with PD develop HD [6].

Generally, human speech can be briefly defined as the ability to create reproducible sounds with certain semantic meanings, produced by coordinated movement of more than 100 muscles [7,8]. The ability to speak is a unique and complex process, which can be subdivided into several dimensions, namely: respiration, phonation, articulation, and prosody [9]. HD affects all dimensions of speech [10,11]. The related speech disorders can be summarized as follows: voice tremor [3], hypophonia [12], dysphonia [13], dysprosody [14], increased voice nasality [15], articulation problems in combination with unorthodox speech silence and speech rate alterations such as hesitation [16], palilalia [16], bradyphemia [17] or tachyphemia [17]. Accordingly, negative impact of HD on daily life in PD has been emphasized by several researchers so far [18,19].

At present, there is no definite cure for PD and the disease is ultimately fatal. Medical treatment of PD is consequently limited to reduction of its cardinal motor symptoms. Conventional treatment of PD consists of pharmacological medication in form of levodopa (L-dopa) [20], which is known to be efficient for treating certain parkinsonian manifestations such as bradykinesia, muscular rigidity and resting tremor on upper and lower extremities. However, the efficiency of L-dopa for alleviating symptoms of HD is insufficient [11]. Moreover, the current diagnosis of PD is based on the presence of primary motor symptoms, which are known to develop after 60–70% of dopaminergic neurons are degenerated [21,22]. In its early stage, PD is very hard to recognize and the symptoms get worse with time. Considering the fact that the effect of PD treatment depends upon the stage of the disease during which it is initiated and the impossibility to halt PD progression, we conclude that the accurate PD rating is critical for effective PD treatment and reduction of its further development that can generally prolong active life expectancy and also mitigate the loss of communication and frequent social isolation of PD patients.

Taking into account all the previously mentioned information, there is an increasing demand for future accurate para-clinical monitoring of PD symptoms. The essential benefits of para-clinical methods in comparison with the clinical ones are the associated non-invasiveness, speed and inexpensiveness (speech can be self-recorded with no need of supervision or expensive equipment) and most importantly its natural objectivity [13,23]. This paper focuses on one of the most commonly used paraclinical method of PD assessment, namely the acoustic analysis of dysarthric speech.

The prosodic features of human speech describe stress and rhythm, speech to pause ratio and velocity, speech intensity and pitch variation [9,24]. Prosody is an important aspect of human verbal communication. It conveys semantic, syntactic and affective information and also reflects emotions of the speaker. Due to vocal tract muscle stiffness [25] patients with PD exhibit alterations of rhythm and speech rate (inappropriate silences, short rushes of speech, and variable speech rate) [14], imprecise articulation, small variations in pitch and intensity (monopitch and monoloudness) resulting into flat voice melody lacking intonation [26,9]. Such deterioration of prosody has a detrimental impact on speech naturalness and intelligibility leading into substantial voice and speech quality deficits.

Intonation is defined as an ensemble of pitch variations during an utterance [27]. According to the previous studies, patients with PD indicated a reduction of fundamental frequency (F0) variability in comparison with healthy speakers [26,28–30]. Following their previous research [8], Skodda et al. [31] investigated F0 variability and speech rate in patients with PD during a reading task. Altogether, they recruited 138 PD patients and 50 healthy controls (HC). Based on the acoustic analysis, PD patients showed significantly reduced variability of pitch compared to healthy speakers when related to the entire reading task, which is in accordance with the previous research [28,29,32] performed in this field of science. Moreover, a notable decline of pitch variation was observed over the course of the reading. In 2011, Rusz et al. [33] demonstrated that even in the early stages of PD, patients do exhibit lower melody intonation and decreased intensity variations referring to limited range of motions and impaired laryngeal tension in combination with insufficient breath support. Results of this study indicated that amongst all known manifestations of HD, patients in the early stage of PD suffer primarily from prosodic impairment. Moreover, Rusz and colleagues [33] reported that reduced melody variations in parkinsonian speech can be related to the lowered ability of stress pronunciation and emotional intonation limitation.

In 2014, Tykalova et al. [34] investigated contrastive stress in 20 male patients in early stage of PD and 16 age- and gender-matched HC. The participants were asked to unnaturally emphasize several key words during a reading task. In contrast with HC, patients with PD showed a distinctively flatter pitch contours, especially at the beginning and the end of a phrase, confirming the previous findings of monopitch intonation in parkinsonian dysprosody [33,35]. In addition, Pell et al. [18] investigated impact of dysprosody on vocal-prosodic communication from the perspective of listeners. They reported that listeners experienced serious difficulties recognizing the emotional prosody (with the exception of anger), sentence mode, phonemic stress and contrastive stress of patients with PD in comparison with healthy speakers. Furthermore, previous studies have reported several cases in which monopitch intonation had been observed several years before the onset of cardinal motor symptoms [36]. Since the monopitch intonation is present in a majority of patients with PD along with its probability to occur even in the early stages of the disease [37], the accurate monitoring of F0 variability is necessary.

As reported by Duffy in [7], monoloudness is a common prosodic flaw in PD. Back in 1986, Metter and Hanson reported a study in which they showed that patients with PD produced a significantly smaller intensity variation compared to healthy speakers during the reading of a standard passage [28]. Later, according to Watson and Munson, PD speakers exhibit overall lower speech intensity, deficits in intensity range, and intensity variations during speech production [38]. In addition, Skodda et al. proposed a gender-related study of dysprosody in PD [39]. This study comprised 169 PD patients and 64 age-matched healthy speakers. They reported a reduction in speech intensity during a reading task composed of 4 sentences. In 2011, Rusz et al. [33] showed that early-staged PD patients do exhibit a decreased intensity variations in comparison with Clark et al. [40] performed a study in which they examined loudness perception in PD (17 PD patients and 25 HC) and reported that patients with PD produced a significantly different pattern and more restricted range compared to healthy speakers in their perception of speech loudness. These results demonstrate the importance of the analysis and treatment (e.g. Lee Silverman Voice Treatment, see [41–44]) of speech intensity deterioration.

Regarding the analysis of speech rate disturbances in PD, back in 1963 Canter [45] found no differences in number of pauses or mean pause duration between patients with PD and healthy speakers during a reading task. However, several years later, Metter et al. [28] demonstrated the presence of these speech rate abnormalities. Amongst more recent studies, in 2008, Skodda and Schlegel [8] analysed articulatory rate and pause time during a standardized reading task (170-syllabic text composed of 4 complex sentences) in 121 PD patients and 70 healthy speakers. They investigated the performance of acoustic measurements applied on the first and the last sentence in order to evaluate the hypothesis of altered speech rate and rhythm in PD. Results of this study confirmed an age-related reduction of articulation rate, proposed by Weismer [46] in 1984.

Furthermore, a gender specific aspects of speech rhythm was referred. However, neither gender-related differences between PD patients and HC in speech rate parameters (total speech rate, net speech rate), nor overall distinctions in speech rate between PD and control subjects were observed. In 2009, Skodda et al. performed a longitudinal study [25] in which they found a speech rate variation (number of syllables per second) closely related to the progression of PD and confirmed the previous findings of Ho et al. [5], in which decisive impairment of speech fluency was found in the more severe stages of the disease. Next, in [31], Skodda et al. investigated net speech rate of patients with PD during a reading task. No significant distinctions of net speech rate between PD patients and HC were observed. In addition, increased number of pauses per second during a reading task were reported by Skodda et al. in [39].

@&#SUMMARY@&#

According to the previous studies, a comprehensive research has been applied in this field of science along with the vast development of wide range of speech tests quantifying various aspects of parkinsonian dysarthria, namely: fast syllable repetition (diadocho-kinetic (DDK) tasks) [47–49], sentence repetition tasks [44,50], numerous reading tasks [39,51], or running-speech (monologue) tasks [25,49,52–54]. DDK tasks have been used several times to assess mainly the articulatory impairment primarily caused by the presence of HD [47–49]. However, several researchers used DDK tasks to investigate dysprosody in PD, e.g. [55]. Regarding sentence repetition task, Bandini et al. [50] have recently employed a study in which they evaluated patterns of dysprosody in patients with idiopathic PD (14 males and 6 females) via a fully automated tool. They showed that PD patients exhibit longer pauses between each sentence repetition confirming the presence of speech rate deficits in HD. According to the research proposed by Rusz et al. [49,54] monologue is the most prospective speech task to assess the speech impairment in PD. However, as reported by Bandini and colleagues [50], the assessment of speech alternations from monologue requires a development of precise and automatic approach, which to our best knowledge has not been standardized yet.

Over the last few decades, researchers have performed studies in which they investigated many aspects of prosodic abnormalities caused by neurodegenerative disorders such as PD [39,56,57]. These studies comprised examination of intonation and melody of speech, variation in speech loudness and timing, contrastive stress and rhythmical deficits. Regarding speech intonation and intensity, Anand and Stepp [58] have recently demonstrated that pitch and intensity variation and the associated naturalness of speech perceived by listeners are strongly correlated. Concerning speech rate disturbances in PD, there are many papers describing the speech rate deficits in PD, confirming the fact that rigidity and hypokinesia of the laryngopharyngeal tractus [12] has a detrimental effect on speech rate and timing [25,31,39]. However, in 2008 Lowit [55] investigated rhythmical impairment in PD and suggested that it is not sufficient to only capture duration-based characteristics without considering their relationship with parameters such as: F0 and intensity of speech.

In summary, reduced variability of pitch, monoloudness and abnormalities in speech rate and pausing have been observed [8,26,28–30,33,35,59]. Whereas monopitch intonation is proven in many articles to sufficiently characterize parkinsonian dysprosody, the results of the previous studies on articulatory velocity and speech rate in patients with PD remains inconsistent [24,29,60]. As reported by Skodda et al. [39] examination of speech rate in PD is task related (syllable repetition may rather indicate articulatory capacities, whereas speech rate characteristics calculated from sentences, standardized reading tasks, or a free monologue are likely to reflect prosodic aspects of HD instead). Several other researchers [61–63] have also pointed out the fact that basal ganglia processing demands differ based on the selection of the associated speech task [32,64]. Furthermore, the results of the previous studies differ significantly in the sample sizes [24,29,60,65] used to assess the speech impairment in HD. Therefore, subsequent research is warranted to offer a deeper understanding of manifestation of PD on the human speech production.

To sum up the introduction, in this paper we perform a complex quantitative analysis of dysprosody in PD. As summarized in the preceding paragraphs, many researchers used reading tasks to assess the prosodic impairment in HD [8,28,31,34,39,45,51]. Therefore to obtain a comparable results, we follow these papers and use reading tasks to investigate dysprosody in PD, namely: (a) reading a short paragraph with neutral emotion; (b) stress-modified reading task (consisted of interrogative, imperative and indicative sentences). Moreover, we introduce the analysis of a poem recitation task. Using this approach we aim to compare the reading task with neutral emotion with the stress-modified reading task and also compare the reading tasks (without rhythmical patterns) with the rhythmically modified recitation task, which is a novel approach in this field of science. To our best knowledge a quantitative analysis of poem recitation task has not been used for the purpose of describing dysprosody in PD patients before. As far as we know, the only related analysis of rhythm in PD was performed by Rusz et al. in [33], however they used a speech task in which the speakers rhythmically read text consisted of 8 rhymes. The aims of this paper can be summarized as follows:
                           
                              1.
                              To compare the selected prosodic features expressing monopitch intonation (standard deviation of fundamental frequency), monoloudness (standard deviation of squared energy operator) and speech rate abnormalities (net speech rate) between PD patients and HC.

Regarding the speech tasks, we aim to compare the performance of these tasks to assess the prosodic impairment in HD: (a) reading task with neutral emotion vs. stress-modified reading task; (b) the reading tasks vs. poem recitation task.

Concerning the speech analysis scenarios, we aim to investigate the classification performance of the following features: (a) features describing monopitch intonation; (b) features expressing monoloudness; (c) features quantifying speech rate abnormalities; and (d) general prosodic features (composed of all three prosodic subsets).

A grand total of 149 Czech native speakers participated in this study. Altogether, 98 patients with idiopathic PD (59 men/39 women; mean age 67.52±8.29 years; mean disease duration 7.80±4.42 years; UPDRS III score 24.91±11.97; RBDSQ score 3.79±3.23; FOG-Q score 7.16±5.81; BDI 13.19±14.57; daily levodopa equivalent dose (LED) 1005.93±545.66mg), see Table 1
                         and 51 healthy controls (25 men/26 women; mean age 63.96±9.21 years) were enrolled at the First Department of Neurology, St. Anne's University Hospital in Brno, Czech Republic. The healthy participants had no history or presence of speech disorders or brain diseases, including neurological and psychiatric illnesses. All patients were examined on their regular dopaminergic medication (ON stage) approximately 1h after the L-dopa dose.

In this study we considered three speech task scenarios comprising two reading tasks and a poem recitation task. First, all participants performed the reading tasks:
                           
                              1.
                              Reading a short paragraph with neutral emotion.

In Czech – I na tom, že člověk si opatří psa, aby nebyl sám, je mnoho pravdy. Pes opravdu nechce být sám.; English translation – Even the fact that a man gets a dog to not be alone is pretty much true. A dog really don’t want to be alone.
                              

Stress-modified reading task.

In Czech – Teď musíš být chvíli trpělivý, než to dokončíme. Už mě to nebaví, dej mi už konečně pokoj! Tak co, jak to dopadlo?; English translation – Now, you have to be patient until we finish it. I’m tired of it already, leave me alone! So, how did it go?
                              

Next, every speaker was asked to recite a poem consisting of 2 rhymes. They read the poem on a paper and tried to recite it for themselves. Consequently, they recited the poem into a microphone, but without any need to keep it in memory, they could still read that from the paper. The poem recitation task:

Speech signals were acquired by a large capsule cardioid microphone M-AUDIO Nova mounted to a boom arm RODE PSA1. The microphone was positioned at a distance of approximately 20cm from the speaker's mouth. Room's environmental noise (measured by NTI Acoustilyzer AL1) was lower than 30dB sound pressure level. The signals were sampled by audio interface M-AUDIO Fast Tack Pro with sampling frequency f
                        s
                        =48kHz and consequently downsampled to 16kHz. All recordings were checked by a trained acoustic engineer who discarded those, which contain some undesirable noise (e.g. speech therapist's cough, and ring-tone of phone). All participants signed an informed consent form that had been approved by the Ethics Committee of St. Anne's University Hospital in Brno.

Prosodic impairments were described using several features based on: (a) pitch variation; (b) intensity variation; (c) speech rate. In the case of pitch variation, we followed Skodda et al. [25] and computed several features based on F0, namely: Standard Deviation of F0 (F0std); Relative Standard Deviation of F0 (Standard Deviation divided by the Mean Fundamental Frequency) (F0r. std); Variation Range (difference between minimum and maximum value) of F0 (F0vr) and Relative Variation Range of F0 (F0r. vr). These features measured the monopitch intonation (degree of monotonicity) caused by the presence of HD. According to Rusz et al. [33] measurement of the fundamental frequency variations is the best approach to quantify dysprosody in patients with PD. For the purpose of F0 extraction, we used Praat acoustic analysis software [72]. In the case of intensity variation we employed similar setup for the feature computation with a difference that we substituted F0 for the speech intensity measure. We used conventional Squared Energy Operator (SEO) and Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TEO) to express the monoloudness in PD patients and calculated several features: Standard Deviation of SEO/TEO (SEOstd/TEOstd); Relative Standard Deviation of SEO/TEO (SEOr. std/TEOr. std); Variation Range of SEO/TEO (SEOvr/TEOvr) and Relative Variation Range of SEO/TEO (SEOr. vr/TEOr. vr). Next, we calculated several features that describe speech rate, such as Total Speech Time (TST), Net Speech Time (NST), Total Pause Time (TPT), Total Speech Rate (TSR), Net Speech Rate (NSR), Total Pause Time (pauses longer than 50ms) (TPT 50), Articulation Rate (AR) and SPeech Index of Rhytmicity (SPIR).

All prosodic features used in this paper were calculated using Neurological Disorder Analysis Tool (NDAT) written in MATLAB and developed at the Brno University of Technology.

Each feature calculation method produces either a single value or a vector of numbers. If there is a resulting vector, we further apply the post-processing step to investigate statistical properties of the calculated features. For this purpose several statistical functionals of the feature vectors were computed. These include some descriptive statistics (max, min, position of max, position of min, relative position of max, relative position of min), range characteristics (range, relative range, interquartile range, relative interquartile range, interdecile range, relative interdecile range, interpercentile range, relative interpercentile range, studentized range), also several means (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, trimmed means without outliers (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%)), quartiles (25/lower, 75/upper), percentiles (1st, 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, 60th, 70th, 80th, 90th, 95th and 99th), moments (3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th, kurtosis, skewness, Spearman's 1st and 2nd skewness coefficient) and other (median, mode, var, std, mean absolute deviation, median absolute deviation, geometric standard deviation, coefficient of variation, index of dispersion, modulation, Shannon entropy, second-order Rényi entropy, slope, offset and error of linear regression) statistical functions.

To obtain some preliminary insight into the statistical properties of the features quantifying prosodic impairments in PD, we followed Tsanas et al. [13] and computed Spearman's rank sum correlation coefficient and mutual information between the feature vectors and associated clinical diagnosis (HC vs. PD). Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ) is a statistical measure of the strength of a monotonic relationship between feature vectors and associated response [73]. Mutual information (MI) is a measure of the amount of the information shared by two random variables. The larger the value of MI, the stronger statistical association between feature and the response can be observed. MI is defined as:

We also performed Mann–Whitney U test to compare the prosodic features between healthy controls and PD patients. The Mann–Whitney U test is non-parametric statistical test used to assess whether two independent groups are significantly different from each other. Additionally, every feature was used separately as an input to the Random Forest (RF) classifier to evaluate its discrimination power. The resulting classification accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) of top three features sorted according to their individual discrimination power (ACC) are listed in Table 2
                        .

Furthermore, we employed a correlation-based analysis of the prosodic features in direction of obtaining an estimate of the correlation between the feature values and the clinical state of PD patients. In this analysis we investigated a relation between four clinical rating scales, namely: UPDRS III; UPDRS IV; FOG-Q and NMSS, see Section 1. Results of the correlation-based analysis are summarized in Table 3
                        .


                        Table 2 clearly indicates that prosodic features taken individually are unable to sufficiently discriminate PD patients and HC. Therefore we further employed a feature selection process to find a combination of the features with the best discrimination power. Probability density estimations of the best performing features are represented in Fig. 1
                        .

A general problem in data analysis is the curse of dimensionality: the presence of a very large number of the features inhibits the detection of the useful patterns underlying the data, which often obstructs the subsequent classification process. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the input feature set and also remove the non-relevant features before the classification, we employed a feature selection process in which the high-dimensional feature space is analysed in direction of obtaining a compact subset of features that holds the maximum clinically relevant information (without loss of predictive information), considerably decrease a risk of overfitting and also reduce the computational performance requirements. It has been proven in many research articles that reduction of the feature space before the classification process can significantly improve the model's prediction power [74].

Many different feature selection methods exist. They are generally divided into following categories: filters, wrappers, and embedded methods [75]. The filter methods select subset of features from entire feature set independently of chosen learning algorithm. Wrapper methods search for best feature subset for a given classifier, however, wrappers are often computationally very expensive. Embedded methods select feature subset using the information obtained from a classifier. In this article we used a two step feature selection process consisting of the preprocessing step using a filter based algorithm and the processing step using a wrapper approach. The rationale behind this approach is the fact that the filter methods are faster and provide better generalization than wrapper or embedded methods [76]. In contrast, the wrapper methods do utilize the learning algorithm of interest to score the subsets of features according to their prediction power.

In the preprocessing step, minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) algorithm was considered. We used the implementation of Tsanas et al. [77] and computed mRMR using Spearman's correlation coefficient as a criterion to quantify the statistical relationships between the features and the response in mRMR, as mentioned in [78]. The features that passed the pre-processing step (for the purpose of this article we used 150 features as a tradeoff between a size of the feature set and the associated computational requirements) were selected as the candidates for further processing and classification. Consequently, we performed the Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) algorithm to determine the best possible feature subset for all considered analysis scenarios. We modified SFFS algorithm proposed by Pohjalainen et al. [79]. Furthermore, we used Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) introduced by biochemist Brian W. Matthews in 1975 [80] as the classification performance criterion in SFFS process. Matthew's correlation coefficient is a commonly used metric in bioinformatics. We choose this particular metric considering its ability to summarize the confusion matrix and also its common usage as a reference performance measurement employed on unbalanced data sets [81]. Matthew's correlation coefficient is defined as:

Random forests is an ensemble learning algorithm that operates by constructing a multiple of base learners (weighted decision trees) [82]. Typically, the RF classifies new sample by the majority of votes from the base learners. RF has got two tuning parameters: the number of the features over which to search to construct each branch of each tree and the number of trees in the classifier. We used the settings, where the number of the features over which to search to construct each branch is equal to the square root of the number of input features and the number of trees is decided to be equal to 500.

We chose this particular algorithm for our classification setup considering its ability to deal reasonably well with high-dimensional and highly correlated data with complex interactions and its ability to rank the importance of used variables.

The classifier validation in the context of this paper is a generalization performance estimate of the classification based on the speech features when presented the novel data. The statistical assumption made here is that the new unseen data have a similar joint probability distribution to the data used to train the classifier. Generally, it is achieved by using the bootstrap techniques or using the cross validation process.

In this study the classifier validation was conducted using 10-fold validation approach with 5 repetitions. The training and testing features were normalized before classification on a per-feature basis to have zero mean and a standard deviation of one. The classification test performance was determined by the computation of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient. The accuracy (P

The theoretical chance level of binary classification is 50%. This threshold is based on the assumption of infinite sample size, which does not hold in practice. The empirical chance level depends on the actual number of samples in the used dataset therefore it is common to see the empirical chance level noticeably above the theoretical threshold for small datasets (60% or even higher) [83]. As the sample size grows the empirical chance level is getting closer to its theoretical value. With the growing dimension of feature space required sample size grows exponentially.

In order to find out if the classification results were obtained by chance or by the actual relationship between the class labels and the data a non-parametric statistical method called permutation test was used. Permutation tests are commonly used tool in biostatistical research. They make no particular assumptions about statistical properties of the samples except that the observations are independent and identically distributed under the null hypothesis, which makes them highly attractive [84].

The main idea behind permutation tests used in classifier performance evaluation is as follows: The null hypothesis is that the observations are independently and identically distributed (in other words, there is no relation between the class labels and the data). The alternative hypothesis is that the distribution differs between groups (in our case between PD and HC groups). The null hypothesis testing requires the p-value to be determined. The most common approach is to estimate the p-value by randomly permuting the labels to obtain the empirical null distribution [84], however, we use the exact p-values in order to mitigate the type I error rate and the multiple testing issues. Details can be found in [84].

If the computed p-value is smaller than a chosen significance level α then the null hypothesis can be rejected, however, this does not mean the alternative hypothesis is true. In other words, the classifier performance on the original data is unlikely to happen if there is no relationship between the class labels and the data.

For the purpose of this article we chose the significance level α to be equal to 0.01. Tested classification models with p-values smaller than the chosen significance level was further consider sufficiently high above chance level. Furthermore, Matthew's correlation coefficient was chosen as a test statistic for the permutation test as it is the measure we used to assess the classification performance of the models during a feature selection step. Since we used the stratified 10-fold cross-validation with 5 repetitions to estimate the performance measures we had to use the same setup for estimating the performance on the permuted data [85].

Another important information about our testing setup is the number of permutations used in determining the p-values. Since we used the exact p-values instead of their estimates, the need to use a high number of permutations was not as critical [84] therefore we chose the number of permutations to be equal to 1000 as a compromise between the statistical power to reject the null hypothesis and the computation power required to assess the performance of the chosen models.

@&#RESULTS@&#

We began the exploration of the data by computing the relevance of the prosodic features to the participants’ clinical diagnosis (PD/HC). The analysis of the prosodic features by Spearman's rank correlation, mutual information, Mann–Whitney U test and a single feature classification can be seen in Table 2. The table shows top three features strongly associated to the response for females, males and a mixture of both genders. As can be seen in Table 2 the best classification performance in terms of classification accuracy of the prosodic features achieved using a single prosodic feature can be summarized as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           
                              P
                              ACC
                              =64.2% for females, P
                              ACC
                              =64.6% for males, and P
                              ACC
                              =68.5% for both genders.


                              P
                              ACC
                              =62.7% for females, P
                              ACC
                              =69.1% for males, and P
                              ACC
                              =58.4% for both genders.


                              P
                              ACC
                              =68.7% for females, P
                              ACC
                              =67.1% for males, and P
                              ACC
                              =59.7% for both genders.

In addition, to obtain an estimation of the relationship between the prosodic feature values and the associated severity of PD, we computed Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the feature values and four widely-used clinical rating scales (UPDRS III, UPDRS IV, FOG-Q, NMSS), see Table 3. The strongest correlation (ρ between values of the prosodic features and values of selected clinical rating scales) in this study was found between TEOr.rng and the values of UPDRS III rating scales computed for the stress-modified reading task of the female patients (ρ
                     =−0.50, p
                     =0.0012). Other correlations can be seen in the table. For every clinical rating scale and every feature (19 in total) ρ was calculated. Amongst those significant (p<0.05) a coefficient with highest absolute value was chosen. If there was no coefficient then one with lowest p-value was selected. One potential limitation of this approach is no correction of chosen coefficient's p-value. Discussion of this limitation is provided in the subsequent section.

To fulfill the first goal of this paper, we compared the values of chosen prosodic features between the group of PD patients and healthy speakers. The results of the comparison are summarized in Table 4
                     . The table clearly indicates that PD patients suffer from dysprosody. Patients showed reduced variation of fundamental frequency compared to HC in almost every scenario (speech task/gender). The only exception observed was in the case of male speakers/reading a passage with neutral emotion. However, this exact reading task does not require any specific stress or intonation therefore this deviation was considered acceptable. Regarding speech intensity variation, the results uncovered an interesting pattern, which is in contradiction with our assumption of monoloudness intensity in patients with PD. In 7 of 9 scenarios, healthy speakers showed less variation in speech intensity than the patients with PD. One of the exceptions again lies in the reading task with neutral emotion, which does not require any specific speech intensity control. The other one occurred during the poem recitation task of the male speakers, which is in absolute contradiction compared to the group of female speakers that showed significantly higher speech intensity variability. These results suggest a presence of some gender-related pattern of parkinsonian speech intensity control impairment. Considering speech rate abnormalities (caused by several extreme values mainly in HC group, e.g. standard deviation of NSR computed from poem recitation task of female control speakers, see Table 4), the results did not show any particular pattern. Further discussion of these results is proposed in the following section.

After the preliminary statistical analysis and prosodic features comparison, we employed a feature selection step in order to obtain a parsimonious, information-rich subsets of features, which provide maximum clinical information about the vocal pathology of patients with PD. For this purpose we used SFFS algorithm in combination with widely-used and robust statistical classifier: Random Forests. Because of relatively limited dataset (149 speakers consisted of 98 PD patients and 51 healthy speakers), we performed stratified k-fold cross-validation (k
                     =10) with 5 repetitions, which has been shown to be a reasonable choice providing low variance as suggested by Combrisson et al. in [83].

Furthermore, the statistical significance of classification (verification that discrimination power of the model is well-above chance level) of each feature subset selected by the SFFS algorithm was assessed by non-parametric statistical method, referred to as permutation test. The advantage of permutation test is that it does not require particular assumption about statistical properties of the samples and therefore provide a data-driven approach to this problem. In this paper, we computed 1000 permutations (randomly exchanging labels of the original observations). Table 5
                      summarizes the classification performance of the feature subsets selected by SFFS algorithm for all feature scenarios calculated for the three investigated speech tasks separately considering the three gender groups (females, males and a mixture of both genders). Subsequently, we performed exactly the same process for the combination of the speech tasks in direction of obtaining the best possible combination of the features that do not only have to come from one particular speech task. The classification performance of the models based on the speech tasks combination is also summarized in Table 5.

To fulfill the second goal, we compared the power to discriminate healthy and dysarthric speech of the following speech tasks: (a) poem recitation task; (b) reading a paragraph with neutral emotion; and (c) stress-modified reading task. The best classification performance in terms of classification accuracy achieved using the prosodic features for each speech task separately can be summarized as follows: T1−
                     P
                     ACC
                     =67.84%, this model used only 3 features based on the analysis of general prosodic impairment (TPT, TEOstd, SEOstd) computed for male participants; T2−
                     P
                     ACC
                     =69.52%, the model used 8 features based on the analysis of general prosodic impairment (SEOstd, F0r. std, TST, TPT, SEOr. std, TPT 50ms, SEOr. vr, NSR) computed for male participants; T3−
                     P
                     ACC
                     =70.71%, the model used just a single feature based on the analysis of monoloudness (TEOr. vr) computed for female participants. Speech tasks notation: T1 represents the poem recitation task; T2 represents the reading task with neutral emotion; and T3 is denoted for the stress-modified reading task. It is worth noting that some of these models did not achieve sufficiently low p-values (we chose the significance level α to be equal to 0.01) needed to reject the null hypothesis tested by the permutation test, see Table 5. This may indicated that more data are required in order to get significant results [86].

The third goal of this paper was to investigate the classification performance of the following prosodic features: (a) monopitch (F1); (b) monoloudness (F2); (c) speech rate (F3) abnormalities; (d) general prosodic features (F4). It was shown that investigated features can be used for diagnosis of PD with the following classification performance: F1−
                     P
                     ACC
                     =64.38%, the model was trained using prosodic features extracted from the stress-modified reading task of female participants; F2−
                     P
                     ACC
                     =70.54%, the model was trained using prosodic features extracted from the reading task with neutral emotion of male participants; F3−
                     P
                     ACC
                     =64.44%, the model was trained using prosodic features extracted from the stress-modified reading task of male participants; F4−
                     P
                     ACC
                     =70.71%, the model was trained using prosodic features extracted from the stress-modified reading task of male participants. These results can be seen in Table 5.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we performed a complex quantitative analysis of dysprosody in 98 patients with idiopathic PD and 51 HC. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1. As mentioned in [39], a fundamental assumption to obtain meaningful results is the comparison of the data obtained from PD patients with the ones acquired from an age- and gender-matched group of control speakers. Therefore, with respect to the previous studies that reported a significant impact of age and gender on some prosodic variables for both PD and HC [46,87,88], we put a lot of emphasis into the selection of age- and gender-balanced groups of speakers participating in our research.

The analysis performed in this paper is based on the quantification of prosodic impairment in HD. For this purpose a set of speech features was extracted using Neurological Disorder Analysis Tool (NDAT) developed by the authors at the Brno University of Technology. As can be seen, we investigated the properties of the features for both genders separately and also for a mixture of both genders. This approach enables a reader to obtain some gender-related insight into the specifics of the features. However, an interesting attempt in the subsequent research would be the addition of gender information into the set of features instead of analysing both genders separately. This approach would naturally increase the samples size and possibly emphasize the gender as an important aspect of the disease and its progression, and therefore could lead into more precise PD diagnosis.

After the feature extraction, preliminary statistical analysis was performed. In this step, we aimed to obtain some preliminary insight into the statistical properties of the prosodic features. For this purpose, we computed Spearman's rank sum correlation coefficient, mutual information and Mann–Whitney U test in order to express the possible relationship between the prosodic features and associated clinical diagnosis (PD/HC) of the speakers. Additionally, every feature was taken individually as an input to the Random Forest classifier to evaluate its power to discriminate healthy and dysarthric speech. Results of preliminary statistical analysis are summarized in Table 2. Moreover, the probability density estimation plots of the best performing features computed for all speech tasks and also for the three gender groups are represented in Fig. 1 giving a visual impression of the distribution of the feature values for healthy speakers and patients with PD. From the results of this analysis, it is obvious that a single prosodic feature does not achieve sufficiently high classification accuracy to reliably distinguish between the two groups of speakers. However, we made an assumption that an appropriate combination of the features would carry enough information about related prosodic impairment. Therefore, further investigation of the features was encouraged.

Consequently, we performed a correlation-based analysis in which we aimed to obtain an estimate of the correlation between the prosodic features and associated degree of PD severity denoted by the values of selected clinical rating scales (UPDRS III, UPDRS IV, FOG-Q and NMSS). As far as we know, there is a limited number of publications dealing with the correlation between a variety of speech features and motor or non-motor symptoms of PD, e. g. [30,39]. However, as can be seen in Table 3, most of the correlation coefficients was located below the value of 0.4. Considering relatively limited dataset, such correlations can be considered rather as an effect of coincidence than serious results. Therefore, we concluded that no significant correlations were detected.

As stated in the introduction, we considered several major goals in this paper. The first goal was to estimate the presence of dysprosody caused by HD and to compare the prosodic features expressing a lack of pitch variation, impaired speech intensity control and speech rate abnormalities between PD patients and HC. The second goal was to compare the suitability of selected speech tasks to assess the prosodic impairment in HD. We analysed the following speech tasks: (a) poem recitation task; (b) reading a paragraph with neutral emotion; and (c) stress-modified reading task. The third goal of this paper was to investigate the classification performance of the speech features extracted from the aforementioned speech tasks. For this purpose we considered several prosodic scenarios in which we inspected monopitch, monoloudness, speech rate abnormalities and general prosodic scenario (a combination of the previously mentioned prosodic flaws).

According to the previous studies, prosody is known to be influenced by the type of speech task used for the assessment [32,64]. As stated by Skodda et al. in their paper focused on the analysis of gender-related patterns of parkinsonian dysprosody using a sentence repetition tasks [39], some aspects of prosody might be different in natural conversational speech in comparison to other speech tasks. However, to obtain data comparable to the previous research, we targeted onto speech tasks based on several reading scenarios. Our results are therefore comparable to the previous research of Skodda et al. in [8,39,51], Rusz et al. in [33], to some extent to the research of Bandini et al. in [50] that focused on the automatic identification of dysprosody in PD using a sentence repetition task, and also to the research of Tykalova et al. in [34] focused on the acoustic investigation of stress patterns in PD using a reading task. One of the novelties of this paper is the quantitative acoustic analysis of prosodic features extracted from a poem recitation task. To our best knowledge, the only related study was performed by Rusz et al. in their paper dealing with the acoustic analysis of early untreated PD [33]. However, as stated in the introduction, this publication considered a speech task in which the speakers rhythmically read text consisted of 8 rhymes.

Regarding the first goal of this paper, we discuss only the major differences between the prosodic features of the patients and controls without the information about the gender or speech task of the listed results. Details can be found in Table 4. We confirmed that patients with PD exhibit decreased intonation variability in comparison with HC (difference of approximately 8.72%). This finding is in accordance with the previous studies of several renowned researchers [28–30,39,45] over the years. Interestingly, our results demonstrated that PD patients showed higher variability of speech intensity than healthy speakers (difference of approximately 12.41%). This is in contradiction with the previous research [28,33,38,39]. However, we hypothesize this fact is a consequence of some gender-related pattern of speech intensity control impairment in HD. This hypothesis is based on the observation of great gender-related distinctions of speech intensity deterioration summarized in Table 4. From our perspective, subsequent investigation of this phenomenon would be of interest. Concerning speech rate abnormalities, our results cannot definitely deduce any particular pattern. The analysis considered a single feature (NSR), which does not capture every aspect of parkinsonian speech fluency deterioration, and therefore is of limited value. More complex analysis of speech rate and irregularity in PD based on this particular set of speech features will be a part of our future studies. Nevertheless, our findings on speech rate disturbances are consistent with the previous findings of Rusz et al. [33]. In contrast, previous research of Skodda et al. [25,39] showed an increase of NSR in PD patients during the reading of a text. Recently, Bandini et al. [50] have also reported increased NSR in the group of PD patients during a sentence repetition task. As stated by the authors of [50], speech rate alterations could be more easily raised from the repetition of a sentence rather than by the reading of a text.

Second goal of this paper was focused on comparison of selected speech tasks in terms of their power to discriminate healthy and pathological speech. Regarding the investigation of the reading tasks, it is worth pointing out the fact that speakers were free to perform the tasks according to their own natural speech rhythm (there were no rhythmical demands imposed). Classification accuracies achieved: T3−
                     P
                     ACC
                     =70.71% for female speakers; and T2−
                     P
                     ACC
                     =69.52% of male speakers, where T3 corresponds to the stress-modified reading task and T2 is determined for the reading task with neutral emotion. At first, the result may indicate no difference between the tasks. However, deeper investigation considerably favours the stress-modified reading tasks. Two main reasons supporting this conclusion are the following: (a) p-value computed using permutation test is lower in the case of T3 in comparison with T2 (p
                     =0.0001 vs. p
                     =0.0050) suggesting higher reliability and statistical significance of the results; (b) in the case of T3, SFFS algorithm selected a single prosodic feature (TEOr. vr) expressing monoloudness, whereas features selected for T2 comprised 8 features. Therefore, the clinical interpretability of the results derived from T3 is far more convenient and practical. One more important aspect to consider is the fact that the two results also differ in their corresponding gender group. Nevertheless, in the case of T2, the results achieved for the group of female speakers are comparable to the ones achieved for the male group. Moreover, the p-values computed for this particular case (T2/male speakers) rejected the hypothesis of statistical significance of the results.

Next, we compared the classification performance of the poem recitation task and the reading tasks. As can be seen in Table 4, the poem recitation task (T1) outperformed both reading tasks in the case of gender-undifferentiated analysis. This suggests that rhythmical demands imposed in T1 can in general lead to more precise discrimination of dysprosody in HD. In contrast to the straightforwardness of this outcome, the gender information consideration inflicted higher classification accuracy of T3 compared to T1. We hypothesize this may be a consequence of some gender-related pattern of parkinsonian rhythm and stress deterioration. Furthermore, it is also important to emphasize the difference in gender group sizes (the mixed group contains approximately twice as many speakers than the gender-separated groups), therefore the difference in performance could be caused by an independent phenomena. Nevertheless, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by the subsequent investigation. Another interesting observation made here is the striking proximity of the classification accuracies achieved by T1 and T2. Considering that T2 does not require any particular rhythm, stress or emotion, marked superiority of T1 would be naturally anticipated. Nevertheless, p-values computed using permutation test repeatedly gave disadvantage to T2.

Regarding the third goal of this paper, we investigated the power of prosodic features to discriminate dysarthric and healthy speech using several scenarios focused on the expression of monopitch, monoloudness, speech rate abnormalities and a combination of these prosodic flaws (general prosodic features). Our results showed that the analysis of a single aspect of parkinsonian dysprosody (using this particular set of features) does not achieve sufficient classification accuracy, which is in some respect consistent with the results proposed by Lowit [55] in 2008. As can be seen in Table 4 this fact is also supported by the p-values computed using the permutation test that in most cases rejected the hypothesis of statistical significance of these prosodic submodels. In contrast, the analysis of general prosodic features improved the classification accuracies of the models. Therefore, we conclude that future development of novel prosodic features quantifying the relationship between monopitch, monoloudness and speech rate disruption in PD is likely to bring deeper understanding of HD and its manifestation on human speech prosody.

To guarantee the relevance of this publication, its limitations need to be pointed out. With respect to our speech sample, one drawback (which is a common one of many studies dealing with the acoustic analysis of speech in PD) is relatively small dataset restricting overall statistical significance of the results. The size of the speech samples investigated in future research will obviously have to be increased. Additionally, since the prevalence rate of PD is estimated to approximately 1.5% (for people aged over 65 years, see [2]), investigated data should reflect this fact. However, our dataset comprises 98 patients with PD and 51 healthy speakers, which therefore does not correspond to reality. Therefore, a need to adjust the number of HC must to be emphasized in the subsequent research. Moreover, it is also worth noting that the current results are based upon speech tasks of relatively limited length (in terms of syllables). As suggested by Rusz et al. in [49,54] speech features computed from a running speech (monologue) are the most prospective ones to assess the speech impairment in PD. The analysis of this particular task will be included in our future studies of dysprosody in HD. Regarding the prosodic features, additional limiting factor of this paper is relatively small number of prosodic features. Up to this day, several other researchers have also investigated prosodic impairment in patients with PD and showed the promising potential of the prosodic features to quantify HD. For instance, the study by Liss et al. [89] employed the analysis of dysprosody in direction of distinguishing speakers with dysarthria from healthy speakers (classification accuracy over 80%) using a set of prosodic features based on vocalic and consonantal segment durations. It would be of interest to investigate the classification performance of more complex set of features comprising prosodic features proposed by Skodda et al in [25] and the ones used in [89]. With respect to the analysis, another potential limitation of our results is the fact that no correction of the p-values obtained by the Mann–Whitney U test, see Table 2, and by Spearman's correlation coefficient in Table 3 was performed. However, since the tests were executed only on 19 prosodic features the errors caused by the multiple testing issue is not as relevant as they could be if hundreds or thousands of features were used.

In summary, this paper confirms the previous findings of reduced pitch variation [26,28–30,32,33], to some extent impaired speech intensity control [28,33,38–40] and speech rate abnormalities [8,28,39,46] in PD. However, the results on monoloudness are not much convincing and definitely require further investigation. Our results also highlight the fact that more studies are necessary in order to fully understand the manifestation of HD on human prosody. In 2009, Skodda et al. [25] used prosodic features to study changes of speech rate and pitch variation in patients with PD over time and showed the presence of some characteristic changes in parkinsonian dysprosody. However, as stated in the article, further longitudinal studies are required. Besides the PD classification and disease tracking, the analysis of dysprosody in HD can also be used during an evaluation of the modern non-invasive treatment methods such as high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) [11], which has a great potential in treatment of Parkinson's disease.

In our future studies of HD we aim to perform more complex analysis of dysprosody using a set of novel prosodic features and extensive set of speech tasks to not only discriminate healthy and pathological speech, but we aim to go further and use the acoustic analysis of prosody to estimate the severity of PD. Additionally, we also aim to explore short-term effects of rTMS applied over pre-defined brain regions and long-term effects of repeated rTMS sessions on prosody in PD.
