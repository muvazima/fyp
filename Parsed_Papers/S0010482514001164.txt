                  This paper presents a model of alveolar–capillary oxygen diffusion with dynamics of air transport through the respiratory tract. For this purpose electrical model representing the respiratory tract mechanics and differential equations representing oxygen membrane diffusion are combined. Relevant thermodynamic relations describing the mass of oxygen transported into the human body are proposed as the connection between these models, as well as the influence of ventilation–perfusion mismatch on the oxygen diffusion. The model is verified based on simulation results of varying exercise intensities and statistical calculations of the results obtained during various clinical trials. The benefit of the approach proposed is its application in simulation-based research aimed to generate quantitative data of normal and pathological conditions. Based on the model presented, taking into account many essential physiological processes and air transport dynamics, comprehensive and combined studies of the respiratory efficiency can be performed. The impact of physical exercise, precise changes in respiratory tract mechanics and alterations in breathing pattern can be analyzed together with the impact of various changes in alveolar–capillary oxygen diffusion. This may be useful in simulation of effects of many severe medical conditions and increased activity level.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The level of oxygen arterial saturation is one of the most significant factors determining the occurrence of respiratory failure. Both structural or functional disorders of the respiratory tract or lung parenchyma may result in a decrease in the value of oxygen concentration in arterial blood and adverse health consequences. Reliable and comprehensive mathematical models of these physiological processes can be used for detailed presentation of selected phenomena in a healthy individual’s body and simulation of pathological conditions caused by changes in relevant physiological parameters and structural damage [1–4]. Many mathematical models of pulmonary oxygen exchange have appeared in the literature over the past decades. Several describe diffusion at various levels of details (for instance, the model developed by Wolf and Garner [5] or Aberg et al. [6]). A number of models include additional physiological processes, that lead to more precise description. For instance Chiari et al. [7] presented a model containing a chemoreflex control of breathing, whereas Melo et al. [8] incorporated an impact of ventilation–perfusion (V̇/Q̇) mismatch. Moreover, Liu et al. [9] presented a comprehensive respiratory model including sub-models of lung mechanics, oxygen diffusion and blood flow. However, none of the models mentioned can be used for modeling alterations in respiratory mechanics in a specific part of the system (e.g. distal airway obstruction) easily and accurately. Moreover, in many models V̇/Q̇ gradient, describing distribution of ventilation and perfusion in the lung height domain is not taken into consideration. These drawbacks significantly reduce the applicability of the models mentioned, because various conditions (e.g. physical effort, specific changes in respiratory mechanics) cannot be properly simulated.

The main objective of the present study is to present a compartment model of alveolar–capillary oxygen diffusion that incorporates a 16-coefficient model of respiratory mechanics. The effect of V̇/Q̇ mismatch is also taken into consideration because of its great influence on respiratory physiology, especially during physical effort or existence of various diseases, resulting in diversification of blood saturation in different lung regions. All the elements mentioned above can be used in modeling normal and various pathological conditions of the respiratory system and in simulation of their impact on the respiratory efficiency. Verification of the model is based on the results obtained for various levels of exercise intensities of a healthy individual represented by a corresponding Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET).

@&#METHODS@&#

In this paper a 16-coefficient electrical model of the respiratory mechanics (
                        Fig. 1) is used, previously proposed by Piwowar [10], and Gajda and Piwowar [11]. Among other models, it also leads to sufficiently approximated description of respiratory system functioning in the time domain—especially in the context of changes in the airflow and its absolute volume. It is a combination of well-known 6- and 10-coefficient models representing the upper and the lower respiratory tract, respectively [10–14]. A 10-coefficient model is a modified DuBois model and its structure represents separately many important anatomical features such as: lung tissues, chest, central and distal airways. Due to that both normal and pathological states can be modeled. The broad usefulness of this model in disease modeling was presented by Redlarski and Jaworski [4]. The values of model parameters are determined based on a priori information. A list of typical values for healthy individuals are presented in 
                        Table 1 and based on data available in [10], [12–16].

The entire process of respiration is initiated by the inspiration, however gas exchange is performed only in the alveoli. As described by Weinberger et al. [17], the total air volume inhaled (V
                        
                           Tot
                        ) is divided into two parts: the volume directed to the alveoli available for gas exchange (V
                        
                           Alv
                        ), and the dead space volume, which is not associated with gas exchange (V
                        
                           D
                        )—for details please refer to 
                        Fig. 2. Moreover, the volume V
                        
                           Tot
                         is related to the value of the total airflow u(t) consisting of: the airflow directed to the alveoli for gas exchange, and the airflow directed to the dead space (u
                        
                           Alv
                        (t) and u
                        
                           D
                        (t), respectively)—associated with the total volume components mentioned above. The final capacity after the inspiration available for gas exchange is equal to the sum of V
                        
                           Alv
                         and Functional Residual Capacity (FRC). The indirect result of this process are the values of: the partial pressure P, the mass m and the volume V of selected gas.

Dynamics of air volume transportation to the alveoli is described by the model presented in Section 2.1. However, it is only a partial description of the phenomena affecting the respiratory efficiency, as the impact of alveolar–capillary oxygen diffusion is also required. A mathematical model of these phenomena proposed by Słomiński [18] and by Kalicka et al. [19] is used in this paper, and its diagram is shown in 
                        Fig. 3. The model describes the process of oxygen diffusion through the alveolar–capillary membrane to pulmonary capillaries and its binding to hemoglobin (explanation of state variables can be found further in the text).

The diffusion phenomenon was described by Słomiński [18] by the following system of differential equations:

Typical values of all diffusion model parameters for healthy individuals are presented in 
                        Table 2, and are based on data available [18,19,21–24]. It should be noted that the BTPS (Body Temperature and Pressure, Saturated) conditions are considered in this model. In this paper the Authors work on the assumption that the alveolar and capillary partial pressures of oxygen are uniform and membrane diffusing properties are constant and uniform.

The model presented in Section 2.2 should be supplemented by the elements describing the V̇/Q̇ ratio in different areas of the lungs. The distribution of both ventilation and perfusion varies with the height of the lungs and the intensity of damage to the parenchyma resulting from a medical condition (e.g. fibrosis) [25,26], what affects the oxygen diffusion significantly. Variable h lie within the range of lung height (0,H). Therefore, the system of Eq. (6) should be presented as:

The total oxygen flow from the alveoli to capillaries consists of a great number of small oxygen streams through the alveolar–capillary membrane at different heights of the organ. Therefore, the final amount of oxygen deposited in blood is the sum of all diffusing oxygen masses. However, for the purpose of simulation-based research defined in Section 1 it seems appropriate to specify only two lung regions of low and high V̇/Q̇ ratios and anatomical shunt as a part of vascular system, as presented by Melo et al. [8]. This separation presents the V̇/Q̇ gradient in normal lung with sufficient accuracy. A growth in V̇/Q̇ mismatch can be modeled by changes in ventilation and perfusion distribution in both regions. In the case of higher precision requirements, additional regions may be considered. The final system of equations representing the oxygen masses of the respiratory system is presented below:

In addition, the volume V
                        
                           Alv
                         is rich in oxygen, but is not transported to the alveoli directly—it is mixed with the air remaining in the dead space after last expiration [16,17]. The concentration of oxygen in the remains is much smaller (related only to the value of the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen in the expiration final phase). Thus, the total flow addressed to the zone associated with gas exchange is a blend of the two streams characterized by different oxygen concentrations. This leads to smaller fluctuations of P

                        CO2 during respiration. Then as a result of a signal from the respiration control centre, expiration is initiated and the lungs are emptied to FRC level. However, a part of the breathing mixture coming from the alveoli remains in the respiratory tract. It will be forced into the lungs at the very beginning of next inspiration—the relevant issues are illustrated in 
                        Fig. 5.

Another essential issue is an evaluation of each airflow participation in the volume V
                        
                           Alv
                        . The coefficients obtained can lead to accurate estimation of the oxygen mass flow delivered to the area responsible for gas exchange. A diagram illustrating the relevant issue is presented in 
                        Fig. 6. The final forms of the coefficients are defined as follows:

The coefficient k
                        2 is defined as the ratio of the volume displaced from the dead space to the entire volume directed to the alveoli. The remaining part of the volume V
                        
                           Alv
                         is supplemented by inhaled fresh air from the external environment of known oxygen concentration—also in relation to the entire volume directed to the alveoli.

Based on the above description as well as Eqs. (11) and (12) the mass streams of oxygen to/from the alveoli can be described by the system of equations:

                        O2(τ) stands for the end-expiration alveolar partial pressure of oxygen in the airways. This pressure is equal to the value of the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen at the end of expiration preceding considered inspiration.

The oxygen stream reaching the alveoli during inspiration is a weighted mean of the streams related to ambient air and residual air in the respiratory tract (Fig. 6), represented by the coefficients k
                        1 and k
                        2. The stream of oxygen forced from the alveoli is associated with the current state of the gas in the alveoli. Therefore, based on relations (13) and (14), the bi-directional stream of oxygen is described as:

The model of the respiratory tract mechanics and the model of the oxygen diffusion should be supplemented with Eq. (15) describing the exchange of oxygen masses between the alveoli and the external environment of the human body. As a result, the value of the oxygen mass flow [gs−1] is determined—resulting in a comprehensive, compartment model of the respiratory system presented in 
                        Fig. 7. Synchronization of the switch (inhalation/exhalation), shown in the diagram, is executed by the signal P

The accuracy of the model proposed should be evaluated in details. In this paper the Authors present an attempt at determining oxygen saturation in pulmonary capillaries of a healthy person during physical effort of variable intensity. It affects the organism by increasing the metabolic rate of oxygen MR (related to the growth in MET). A response of the central nervous system to alteration of arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide (P
                        
                           a
                        O2 and P
                        
                           a
                        CO2) leads to a significant increase in ventilation by the amplitude A and the frequency f modulation of the respiratory muscles contraction represented by the pressure P
                        
                           g
                        . This effect is impaired by the respiratory tract mechanics what results in reduction of expected air volume inhaled—especially during intensive exercise. The demand for oxygen should be counterbalanced in accordance with Eq. (10). The increase in ventilation results in a growth of the total volume inhaled and its component directed to the alveoli. No rise is observed for the dead space what causes a change in the value of the coefficient k
                        
                           a
                        . It affects the values of the coefficients k
                        1 and k
                        2, based on Eq. (13).

Moreover, in response to exercise the circulatory system undergoes many serious physiological changes. A significant increase in the values of heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output were reported many times before, e.g. by Marshall and Shepherd [27] or Rowland et al. [28]. The pulmonary circulation is also affected substantially. As a result, the capillary blood volume V
                        
                           c
                         rises significantly. The increase makes the pulmonary artery pressure rise, however even during intensive exercise this change is relatively small due to the vasodilation [29]. Moreover, a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen in pulmonary arterial blood results from the increased oxygen consumption what makes the value of P
                        
                           s
                        O2 decrease significantly. As an effect of all these alterations, transit time of blood cells is significantly reduced that constitutes the diffusion limitation, represented by the change in D
                        
                           L
                         parameter [25]. Moreover, pulmonary shunts almost insignificant at rest may have a much greater impact on the partial pressure of oxygen in pulmonary venous blood during exercise what was estimated in [25,30–32].

In addition, the physical activity results in a significant change of the V̇/Q̇ gradient. Distributions of both ventilation and perfusion are altered. Wagner [25] reported that a mismatch in ventilation is deepen with an increase in the respiratory rate. Furthermore, he stated that a perfusion dispersion is found to increase in spite of a small rise in the pulmonary artery pressure. All those issues lead to alterations in the values of the coefficients a

On the basis of detailed analysis of [19,25,27–30,33], Eqs. (10), (12), (13) and simulation-based research, the values of essential model parameters for physical activity, typical for a healthy individual, have been estimated by the use of the model proposed and are presented in 
                        Table 3.

Simulation results obtained and those published in medical literature, based on various clinical trials, should be compared by an appropriate statistical method. It is extraordinarily difficult to make such a comparison because of many factors determining final saturation of an individual—natural variation, individual endurance and numerous definitions of various intensities of physical activity. Therefore, saturation results found in the literature are very different. In order to eliminate the occurrence of type I error the selected clinical results are expected to follow the normal distribution. For a little result group, the Shapiro–Wilk test may be performed as proposed by Royston [34]. It tests the null hypothesis of a normally distributed population of samples x

In the current research Matlab/Simulink environment is used. Ode45 is selected as a variable step solver with the minimum and maximum step as 10−6 and 10−2
                        s, respectively. Series of simulations are performed to estimate the following quantities: the oxygen consumption VO2(t), the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen P
                        
                           A

                           c
                        O2(t). Moreover, the alveolar–capillary difference of oxygen partial pressure PA-cO2(t) is also determined as the difference between partial pressures of oxygen in pulmonary circulation: alveolar P

                           c
                        O2(t). Each of the quantities mentioned is considered for three levels of physical activity: none, moderate and intensive described by the MET levels (Table 3).

Time histories of oxygen consumption VO2(t) are illustrated in 
                     Fig. 8 and represent a balance of oxygen masses supplied, excreted and utilized by the system corrected for STPD (Standard Temperature and Pressure, Dry) conditions. The studies present that as a result of activity intensification, oxygen consumption VO2(t) increases rapidly.

Further results obtained and shown in

Further simulation results, presented in

                     O2(t) for various levels of physical activity. Oxygen saturation is one of the most important model parameters as crucial indicator of the respiratory effectiveness. At rest, the oxygen saturation value of approx. 97–99% is typical. Great intensification of physical activity results in a noticeable drop in oxygen saturation. Therefore, changes in the shape and the mean value of simulated saturation of oxygen can be visualized by two measures defined by the Authors that are also presented in Fig. 11. In the case of the first measure, the mean value is calculated for the period T
                     
                        p
                      equal to the time of one respiratory cycle. The cycle is defined by the time t
                     0 that characterizes the analyzed period, and the mean value can be calculated as follows:

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Based on the results presented in Section 3, the compartment model developed and presented in Fig. 7 leads to satisfactory estimation of the oxygen diffusion efficiency of a healthy individual. The model proposed can be used for modeling many normal and pathological conditions of the respiratory system. Verification of the results obtained for various levels of exercise intensity of a healthy individual is based on the results of clinical trials presented in medical publications.

Time histories of the oxygen masses: supplied, excreted and utilized, presented in Fig. 8 show that the oxygen consumption VO2(t) increases rapidly. This phenomenon is obviously associated with a growth in the values of ventilation and MR (increased linearly with MET). During the study a linear alteration of VO2(t) is noted, however Ariyoshi et al. [35] reported only approximate linearity.

Time histories of alveolar partial pressure of oxygen P
                     
                        A
                     O2(t) and the alveolar–capillary difference of oxygen partial pressure P
                     
                        A-c
                     O2(t) illustrate that a growth in the value of the MR, associated with a physical activity, leads to an increase in the value of P
                     
                        A
                     O2(t). Due to a nervous system response, minute ventilation increases. As a result the amplitude and the mean value of the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen also increase. While capillary partial pressure of oxygen P
                     
                        c
                     O2(t) remains unchanged by physical effort until the very high intensity, P
                     
                        A
                     O2(t) and P
                     
                        A-c
                     O2(t) progressively increase, reaching respectively 16.6 and 4.8kPa for an intensive effort, whereas P
                     
                        c
                     O2(t) drops substantially to the value of 11.8kPa. Wagner [25] stated that V̇/Q̇ changes account to only half of that fall. The remaining part is equated with shunt effects and diffusion limitation caused by a reduced transit time of red blood cells. Sun et al. [36] noticed an increase in the amplitude of the P
                     
                        c
                     O2(t) with an intensification of physical activity. It should be noted that all results obtained are consistent with the information available in medical literature [25,31,35,37–42].

Time histories and respective coefficient values of the capillary saturation of oxygen S
                     
                        c
                     O2(t), illustrated in Fig. 11, present alterations in parameters considered for various levels of physical activity. A decrease in the mean values results from a decrease in the capillary partial pressure of oxygen. Furthermore, an increase in the amplitudes of the capillary saturation is caused by greater oscillations of the capillary partial pressure of oxygen, according to Eq. (7). A bigger inclination of the hemoglobin oxygen-dissociation curve also plays a great role [24]. The results obtained with the use of the compartment model may be compared with the results of many clinical trials found by the Authors in medical literature. However, few of them were obtained for healthy individuals doing exercises of specified, graded intensity and only this part is selected for further studies. The results selected are collected in 
                     Table 4. They are classified as one of three effort levels considered. For every level, SW value (17) is calculated and compared with the critical value of SW for a considered statistical significance (α=0.05) in 
                     Table 5. Based on results of Shapiro–Wilk test, all series considered follow the normal distribution and may be a statistical representation of the capillary saturation of oxygen during exercise of specific intensity despite the small size of samples population.

Statistics of investigated levels of physical effort (mean value and standard deviation) are presented in Table 5. Based on these results saturation levels simulated, collected in Table 4, are within the ranges obtained. Because of that it should be emphasized that all research results are consistent with clinical trials results available in numerous scientific publications concerning the body functions during exercise [31,36,39,41–47].

The model proposed is a very efficient alternative to multiple clinical trials on humans, leading to respiratory efficiency observations and analyses. It provides a quick and highly satisfactory modeling of many normal and pathophysiological conditions. Results of physical activity modeling are verified in this paper based on the results of clinical trials. Versatility of the 16-coefficient electrical model in respiratory diseases modeling was presented by Redlarski and Jaworski [4]. By the use of this model various changes in respiratory mechanics can be located very precisely. The impact of microangiopathy on the respiratory efficiency based on the solution described in Section 2.2 was modeled and verified by Słomiński [18]. Many other degenerations, injuries and diseases can be modeled and used for research after extensive verification based on clinical examination results. For instance, the impact of deteriorated oxygen diffusion in interstitial lung diseases [25,26] or respiratory mechanics disturbances in a direct place of the system in many airway/lung diseases such as: asthma, fibrosis, COPD [4] can be roughly simulated with the use of the model proposed. A satisfactory approximation of the various physiological processes can facilitate numerous comprehensive and combined simulation-based studies of the respiratory efficiency. The impact of many simultaneously occurring medical conditions and states, such as: physical exercise, changes in respiratory tract mechanics and alveolar–capillary diffusion, breathing pattern alterations, can be analyzed.

It is obvious that the presented combination of respiratory mechanics and oxygen saturation models is only a limited representation of very complex physiological processes. Many phenomena are omitted or simplified because higher precision is well-founded and reasonable only in the case of extreme modeling requirements and is associated with great difficulties to obtain all necessary parameters. The 16-coefficient model is a limited representation of respiratory tract mechanics and omitting significant resistance nonlinearity during deep, fierce breathing [4], [48]. This should be noted when modeling breathing patterns in Section 2.5. Moreover, Tomalak [48] reported a significant reduction of its applicability in clinical trials with no possibility of reliable parameter identification.

Moreover, no circulatory system model is considered as a part of the proposed solution. Therefore, some of the changes mentioned in Section 2.5 cannot be expressed properly. Circulatory response to exercise is very intricate and some physiological parameters change in an unpredictable way. It should be noted that the requirement for extremely high model accuracy implies the incorporation of a pulmonary circulation model.

Furthermore, the remaining components of air (e.g. N2, CO2) are not considered in this paper. Especially the latter one impacts on many physiological mechanisms and properties. CO2 is the most important component in the chemical regulation of respiration and any change in its partial pressure in blood significantly alters the breathing pattern, what is approximated in Section 2.5. Moreover, CO2 greatly affects oxygen binding to hemoglobin [23]. However, this effect is much smaller in the considered part of the saturation curve – plateau portion – and thus, it can be omitted.

It should be noted that in a real lung, heterogeneity of oxygen concentration in the bronchial tree occurs. Oxygen advection is predominant in the upper part and diffusion in the lower part [24]. At the acinar level a permanent inhomogeneity of oxygen partial pressure is associated with the diffusion screening, however its existence is still controversial [49,50]. This phenomenon is related to a reduced gas exchange surface at rest, what makes considerable reserves of diffusion capacity during an exercise. Despite a great physiological significance, the intra-acinar PO2 heterogeneity is of an extremely small degree [51] and thus is not considered in the presented model. Even during exercise the acinus remains a sensibly homogeneous gas phase.

Finally, calculation of oxygen partial pressure in the alveoli and blood based solely on the ideal gas law is also a simplification. E.g. gas in the alveoli is frequently considered as incompressible – as presented by Ben-Tal [52] – especially in the diffusion-dominated region of the acinus [49]. However, even if convection is minor in this part of the acinus, air compression during respiration cannot be omitted in the major part responsible for notable part of the acinus diffusion [51]. Furthermore, the ideal gas law is used mainly to determine changes in oxygen partial pressure caused by oxygen mass stream directed to/from the alveoli. Therefore, the impact of considered air compression in the alveoli is negligible. On the other hand, PO2 in liquid blood is related to solubility [24] and differs from the values calculated by the ideal gas law. However, in practice for many liquid substances a deviation between those methods is not significant and amounts approximately a few pct. Most of the parameters used in this paper are determined during various medical examinations with the accuracy of this order, hence simplification made can be justified.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

All issues and results presented in this paper prove the usefulness of the compartment model. The obtained simulation results of physical activity are verified by the results of various clinical trials. The benefit of the model comes from its usefulness in numerous comprehensive and combined simulation-based studies of the respiratory efficiency aimed to generate qualitative data of various effects of normal and pathological conditions. The impact of many alterations in both mechanical and diffusional parts as well as breathing pattern can be simulated and verified by clinical examination results of patients. However, a few model drawbacks, reducing its accuracy and arising from the non-linear character of respiratory mechanics and simplifications of specific physiological phenomena, should be considered. Further integration between the compartment model proposed and models of other biological processes, such as blood circulation and nervous control of respiration, seems very promising.
