                  We present a framework to optimize the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of a loss distribution under uncertainty. Our model assumes that the loss distribution is dependent on the state of some system and the fraction of time spent in each state is uncertain. We develop and compare two robust-CVaR formulations that take into account this type of uncertainty. We motivate and demonstrate our approach using radiation therapy treatment planning of breast cancer, where the uncertainty is in the patient’s breathing motion and the states of the system are the phases of the patient’s breathing cycle. We use a CVaR representation of the tails of the dose distribution to the points in the body and account for uncertainty in the patient’s breathing pattern that affects the overall dose distribution.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The value-at-risk (VaR) of a loss distribution at the confidence level 
                        
                           β
                        
                      is the smallest loss such that the probability of exceeding such a loss is at most 
                        
                           β
                        
                     . The VaR concept is useful to measure quantities associated with the tail of a loss distribution. It has found application in areas such as finance (Duffie & Pan, 1997; Linsmeier & Pearson, 2000; El Ghaoui, Oks, & Oustry, 2003) and healthcare (Bortfeld, 1999; Wu & Mohan, 2000; Erkut, Ingolfsson, & Erdoğan, 2008), but solving optimization problems with VaR metrics are challenging since these problems are non-convex (Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, & Heath, 1999). Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is an alternative metric that measures the average of the tail loss values (Rockafellar & Uryasev, 2000). One of the attractive features of CVaR is that it is convex (Rockafellar & Uryasev, 2002). However, uncertainty in the underlying loss distribution results in uncertainty in the CVaR measurements.

Many researchers have considered robust optimization in a CVaR framework, particularly in financial engineering. Robust optimization is a technique that can be used to manage uncertainties in the data of an optimization problem. In traditional robust optimization, an uncertain hard constraint is replaced by its robust counterpart, to which the solution remains feasible under any realization of the uncertain data within some specified set (Ben-Tal & Nemirovski, 1999, 2000; Bertsimas & Sim, 2004). In the literature of robust CVaR methods, one general approach aims to optimize the worst-case with respect to the choice of the underlying distribution of the stochastic parameter that characterizes the loss distribution (Jabbour, Peña, Vera, & Zuluaga, 2008; Huang, Zhu, Fabozzi, & Fukushima, 2008, 2010; Zhu & Fukushima, 2009). Quaranta and Zaffaroni (2008) considered optimizing a CVaR objective, subject to standard linear constraints with uncertain coefficients, whereas Natarajan, Pachamanova, and Sim (2009) considered CVaR with uncertain parameters in the objective function and formulated worst-case CVaR models for different types of uncertainty sets. Our model is similar in mathematical structure to the mixture and discrete distribution models of Zhu and Fukushima (2009), who consider a likelihood distribution on the sample points and derive a min–max approach to minimize the worst-case scenario. However, we consider a different interpretation of the uncertainty and optimize the expected tail loss as opposed to minimizing the worst-case.

In this paper, we consider a system that can be in one of many states at any point in time. The number of states and the loss distribution corresponding to each state are known, but the fraction of time that the system spends in each state is unknown. For example, system states could correspond to states of the economy (e.g., recession, growth) and a different distribution of stock market returns would exist in each state. Our approach models the uncertain fraction of time the system spends in each state and aims to optimize or constrain the accumulated mean tail loss (CVaR) over some period of time. Our robust-CVaR model generalizes some of the existing CVaR models in the literature and is less conservative than worst-case approaches.

The development of our robust-CVaR model is motivated by an application in cancer therapy. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a cancer treatment method that aims to deliver sufficient radiation dose to a tumor while sparing healthy organs. An IMRT treatment generates a dose distribution – a distribution of dose to points inside the body. In the literature of IMRT treatment planning, the CVaR concept has been used to formulate constraints on the tails of a dose distribution (Romeijn, Ahuja, Dempsey, Kumar, & Li, 2003; Romeijn, Ahuja, Dempsey, & Kumar, 2006). For example, treatments generally aim to minimize underdose (i.e., lower tail of the dose distribution) to the tumor or overdose to healthy organs. Separately, robust optimization has been used to deal with setup uncertainty and day-to-day positioning errors (Chu, Zinchenko, Henderson, & Sharpe, 2005), dose calculation errors (Ólafsson & Wright, 2006), and motion during the treatment session (Chan, Bortfeld, & Tsitsiklis, 2006; Bortfeld, Chan, Trofimov, & Tsitsiklis, 2008). However, there is no literature that combines robust optimization and CVaR in IMRT. We will apply the robust-CVaR method developed in this paper to breast cancer IMRT, where CVaR constraints are used to limit tail dose to the organs and robust optimization is used to mitigate the effects of breathing motion uncertainty, which causes the chest to move unpredictably during treatment.

Our specific contributions in this paper are as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           We develop a robust-CVaR framework that models the tail of a distribution, which changes over time depending on the state of some system. Our framework is tractable through a duality-based reformulation, and generalizes the stochastic and worst-case CVaR models in the optimization literature.

We develop the first optimization model in IMRT treatment planning that embeds robust optimization within a CVaR framework. This model generalizes the existing clinical treatment planning methods for breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in females worldwide (Jemal et al., 2011). Patients receiving radiation therapy for left-sided breast cancer demonstrate increased cardiac morbidity (Giordano et al., 2005; Harris et al., 2006; Hooning et al., 2007), which is highly dependent on the volume of heart exposed to radiation during treatment (Marks et al., 2005; Lind et al., 2003). This fact motivates the development of specialized radiation therapy treatment methods for left-sided breast cancer to minimize damage to the heart. Furthermore, breathing motion during treatment causes the heart to move in and out of the radiation field (Jagsi et al., 2007), which adds to the challenge of effectively and consistently sparing the heart.

The clinical acceptability of a radiation treatment is usually assessed using dose-volume criteria (the dose to a certain percentage of a structure), which is an equivalent concept to the VaR of a distribution. For example, at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada, one of the dose-volume criteria is that at most 10 cubic centimeters (cc) of the volume of the heart may receive a dose higher than 21.1Gy (Gray (Gy) is the standard unit of measurement for radiation dose). CVaR can be used to constrain the mean dose received by the subset of “voxels” (small volume elements) receiving the highest or lowest dose in a structure. A clinical target volume (CTV) is the primary target that we aim to treat in breast cancer. Fig. 1
                      shows an example distribution of the dose delivered to the CTV, and the CVaR metric describes the average dose to the sub-volume of the CTV receiving the most (or least) dose.

A distinguishing feature of treating breast cancer using radiation therapy is the presence of breathing motion. First, breathing motion makes the breast a moving target. The motion pattern may be difficult to predict and can change without warning. Second, the motion induces anatomical changes that fluctuate back and forth between geometries that are more favorable and less favorable for treatment. Specifically, at full inhale, the expanded lung pushes the heart away from the breast and, therefore, the treatment field. At exhale, the heart is closer to the breast and is generally exposed to more radiation. Thus, the quality of the treatment is influenced by the amount of time the patient spends in different phases of the breathing cycle. The breathing phases represent the state of the system in our general framework. Uncertainty in a patient’s breathing pattern leads to potential uncertainty in the delivered dose distribution and hence treatment quality. Our robust-CVaR approach aims to ensure that the clinical dose-volume criteria are met in the presence of uncertainty due to breathing.

First, we briefly review the standard (stochastic) CVaR model, closely following the conceptual framework of Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000). Then, we extend this model to formulate CVaR in systems with multiple loss distributions corresponding to different states.

Consider a system that at any time can be in one of a finite number of states 
                           
                              i

                        . For each state, there is a different loss distribution associated with it. In our model, the decision maker is optimizing over a certain time horizon in which the state of the system will fluctuate unpredictably and the cumulative loss will be uncertain, depending on the amount of time the system spends in each state. The proportion of time that the system spends in state i,

                        The samples per state represent random draws from the state-specific loss distributions, and the time-weighted cumulative loss distribution can be found by accumulating the loss for each sample.

Both (w-CVaR) and (CVaR-a) formulation can be applied if the same set of random samples is used for all states. However, if a different set of samples is used per state, we can only calculate the state-specific loss distributions and (CVaR-a) formulation does not apply. In Section 4, we will show that the issue of sampling has an important interpretation from a medical physics perspective in the IMRT application.

These robust-CVaR definitions can be used in the objective or constraints of a mathematical program. In this paper, we focus on robust constraints that involve bounds on CVaR. An upper robust-CVaR constraint at the level

                        Similarly, the lower-CVaR calculated from Eq. (CVaR-a) is always greater than or equal to that from Eq. (w-CVaR). Thus, in general, when the same set of samples is used for each state, using (CVaR-a) definition results in a less conservative constraint (2) than using (w-CVaR) definition.

The choice of CVaR variant also affects the size of the optimization problem. An upper robust-CVaR constraint at the level

In the remainder of this paper, we will use terms such as “(w-CVaR) model” and “(CVaR-a) model” to refer to optimization models that involve constraints like (3) and (4), respectively. In Section 5, we will also show that a (CVaR-a) model generates less conservative solutions than a (w-CVaR) model.

The tractability of (w-CVaR) and (CVaR-a) formulations is dependent on the structure of 
                           
                              P

                              P
                           
                         is ellipsoidal, then the robust-CVaR formulations can be re-written as second-order conic programs, and if 
                           
                              P
                           
                         is polyhedral, they can be re-formulated as linear programs (Ben-Tal, El Ghaoui, & Nemirovski, 2009). These methods are standard, duality-based reformulations. In the IMRT application, we focus on the polyhedral uncertainty set

Worst-case CVaR is normally defined as the CVaR value corresponding to a probability distribution that generates the highest upper CVaR (in the case of minimizing the tail loss). Let

If distribution i generates the worst-case CVaR value, then the robust-CVaR formulation generates the worst-case solution over the set of distributions. If the uncertainty set is confined to one element

                        , which represents the nominal PMF of the system, the robust formulation in this case will represent the traditional stochastic formulation. In other words, our robust-CVaR framework generalizes the worst-case and nominal (stochastic) CVaR models from the literature. Also, it easy to see that our robust-CVaR method is less conservative than the worst-case models because it takes into account the fraction of time that the system spends in the worst-case state along with the other states of the system, rather than considering the worst-case only.

Treatment planning for breast cancer is most commonly implemented using a simple radiation beam geometry in which two opposed tangential beams (Fig. 2
                        ) are used to irradiate the whole breast volume (Kestin et al., 2000; Landau, Adams, Webb, & Ross, 2001; Vicini et al., 2002). The concave shape of the chest wall results in unavoidable dose to parts of the heart. The tangential opposed beam setup with IMRT is currently used in clinical practice (Purdie, Dinniwell, Letourneau, Hill, & Sharpe, 2011).

To create a treatment plan, the current clinical standard is to acquire a single CT scan while the patient is breathing freely. Breathing motion results in image artifacts. The artifacts can be image blurring, which makes structures appear enlarged or image under-sampling, which results in images with truncated structures. The radiation treatment is designed using this “average scan” as input, and the treatment is delivered while the patient is breathing freely. We denote this method the “average method”.

When there is a large volume of the heart in the radiation field, according to the average scan, the patient is re-scanned at a fixed inhale breathing phase (Wang et al., 2012). Breath-hold at inhale expands the lung and pushes the heart away from the breast. Because the patient needs to maintain a stable lung volume for the duration of the scan, an active breathing control (ABC) device, which holds the patient’s lung at a specified and reproducible volume, is used. The radiation treatment is designed using the “ABC scan” as input. During each treatment session, the ABC device is again used to ensure the patient reproduces the same lung volume. We denote this method the “ABC method”.

The ABC method better spares the heart, while maintaining target coverage, compared to the average method. However, there are downsides. The ABC method is more time-consuming at imaging and treatment delivery, it is expensive because of the device, and not all patients are able to tolerate long breath holds. The average method requires less time for delivery and can be applied to all patients. However, it does not explicitly consider breathing motion, does not explicitly aim to limit heart dose, and the actual radiation dose accumulated in the various parts of the chest during free breathing may be different from what is planned due to the image artifacts described earlier.

Our robust-CVaR approach attempts to capture the benefits of both the average and ABC methods. The ability to deliver the treatment while the patient is breathing freely and improved heart sparing even in the face of uncertainty in the patient’s breathing motion. Our approach leverages “4D-CT” imaging data, which provides multiple snapshots of the anatomy over the entire breathing cycle, as opposed to a single average scan.

Our approach to modeling the breast cancer IMRT problem is an example of the general framework described earlier in this paper. The states represent phases of the patient’s breathing cycle (e.g., full inhale, full exhale, and all phases in between).

                         represents the fraction of the time the patient is in breathing phase

                        . As the patient breathes, a varying amount of heart and lung will enter the treatment field, which affects the dose delivered to those organs. Our robust-CVaR model controls the tails of the dose distributions to the organs of interest, while accounting for breathing motion uncertainty. First, we formulate the basic CVaR model without uncertainty with the IMRT context. Then, we introduce breathing motion uncertainty.

                           Lower CVaR constraints can be defined analogously to upper CVaR constraints. Normally, upper CVaR constraints are included for both the healthy organs and the target. Lower CVaR constraints, however, are typically required only for the target. The full treatment planning model without motion uncertainty is shown in Appendix A.

Next, we incorporate breathing motion into the model and develop a robust version to account for breathing motion uncertainty. Each breathing pattern is represented by an uncertain PMF. Background information on how actual breathing pattern traces (e.g., sinusoidal waves) can be converted into PMFs can be found in Lujan, Larsen, Balter, and Haken (1999) and Chan et al. (2006).

A 4D-CT scan is used as the input data for this model. It is composed of multiple images, one per phase. Assuming the voxel size remains constant throughout the images, each structure may be represented by a different number of voxels in each phase. The number of voxels in each phase corresponds to the number of samples to approximate the distribution in formulation (w-CVaR).

                           Eq. (6) corresponds to computing the phase-specific CVaR values, weighted by the time spent in each phase, and is equivalent to (w-CVaR) equation.

To be able to use (CVaR-a) equation, we need to use the same set of voxels in each structure throughout the breathing phases. One way to do that is to create a one-to-one mapping of the voxels across phases. This task can be accomplished using deformable registration (Brock et al., 2003, Brock, Sharpe, Dawson, Kim, & Jaffray, 2005). Typically, each structure is represented as a mesh, which is deformed from phase to phase so that the vertices on the surface of the mesh are in one-to-one correspondence throughout the phases. With such a mapping between the images, the number of voxels remains constant in each phase, but their sizes are changing.

As a result of the deformation mapping, the

                           which corresponds to Eq. (CVaR-a).

If we can track the voxels across phases, both formulations can be used. Otherwise, only (w-CVaR) formulation can be used. The full clinical formulation based on (CVaR-a), which includes both lower and upper CVaR constraints, is given in Appendix B along with its duality-based reformulation. Specific parameter settings and a description of the clinical data are provided in Appendix C. The same parameter settings were used in both formulations.

Before demonstrating computational results, we explain how our robust-CVaR formulation generalizes the two existing clinical methods previously described: the average and ABC methods. In the average method, the treatment plan is based on a single “averaged” scan of the patient’s anatomy captured during free breathing. Only the information from this scan is used to generate the treatment plan. In our CVaR-based treatment planning paradigm, the average method can be modeled using our initial CVaR model (5) with a dose-influence matrix

                                    ,
                                    b
                                 
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                              
                           
                         representing the dose voxel v receives per unit intensity of beamlet b in the anatomical setup depicted by the average scan. In the ABC method, the treatment plan is based on an image of the patient anatomy at inhale. Again, the ABC method can be modeled using our initial CVaR model (5) and a dose-influence matrix 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    D
                                 
                                 
                                    v
                                    ,
                                    b
                                 
                                 
                                    I
                                 
                              
                           
                         representing the dose voxel v receives per unit intensity of beamlet b in the geometry induced by the patient at full inhale.

Given the above discussion, it follows immediately that the robust-CVaR models are a generalization of the two clinical methods. Take formulation (6) as an example and set

In this section, we demonstrate the application of (w-CVaR) and (CVaR-a) formulations using clinical data. We divided the patient’s breathing cycle into five phases. The nominal PMF had 50% of the probability at the exhale phase, and the remaining 50% was evenly distributed across the remaining four phases. This PMF is structurally representative of regular, exhale-weighted breathing. We define the uncertainty set

                        ) and measured the difference in performance among the average, ABC, and robust-CVaR methods. The random PMFs were drawn uniformly from the probability simplex using a Dirichlet distribution with the parameter 
                           
                              α

                         (Ng, Tian, & Tang, 2011). Then, we categorized the resulting PMF into one of the three sets mentioned above. We repeated this process until 100 PMFs were generated in each set.

The results are shown in Fig. 4
                        . Both axes measure VaR metrics. The x-axis measures the minimum dose to the 25 cubic centimeters (cc) of the heart that receive the most dose (the “hottest” 25cc of the heart). The y-axis measures the dose at the 95th percentile of the dose distribution of the CTV. Each point represents one realized PMF. The filled points correspond to PMFs that are inside the uncertainty set, while the unfilled points correspond to ones outside of the uncertainty set. The dashed lines indicate the clinically acceptable limits for the two metrics. If a dose distribution exceeds the limit, generally the treatment would be considered unacceptable and would need to be re-planned. The ABC dose distribution is also shown. It represents the dosimetric gold standard, because the treatment is delivered in the absence of any motion. To facilitate the comparison, all dose distributions were normalized to a mean CTV dose of 42.4Gy (the prescribed dose).


                        Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the results for (w-CVaR) and (CVaR-a) models, respectively, with the uncertainty set 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    10
                                 
                              
                           
                        . It can be seen that (CVaR-a) formulation results in a less conservative dose to the CTV compared to that of (w-CVaR) formulation; hence, it allows for a lower dose on the heart. In other words, the dose to the CTV in Fig. 4(b) is closer to the clinical limit while meeting the limits under all realized scenarios inside the uncertainty set.

                         to represent a decreased level of conservatism. This analysis seeks to shed light on the trade-off between reducing heart dose and maintaining target coverage. The results are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). In this case, the robust dose distributions generally have lower heart dose, with a more noticeable separation between the robust and average results seen in Fig. 4(d). This reduction in the heart dose is very small in Fig. 4(c) since (w-CVaR) formulation is more conservative on the CTV and does not allow for a reduction of the heart dose at the price of reducing the CTV dose. The trade-off for the improved performance on the heart is that in a few of the simulated scenarios, the robust treatment violates the minimum dose target for the CTV. These results illustrate the expected trade-off between being robust against target coverage and sparing the heart under uncertainty. It should be noted that the primary goal in breast cancer IMRT is to cover the target, which was accounted for in our models as a CVaR constraint. Therefore, being robust in target coverage under a larger uncertainty set is possible only at the price of more dose to the heart. On the other hand, if one can guarantee less variability in the patient’s breathing pattern, then it is possible to use a smaller uncertainty set in the robust-CVaR model to reduce dose to the heart.


                        Fig. 4 shows that even if the planned dose distribution for the average method is entirely acceptable on the average scan, the realized dose distribution during treatment may be worse. This result has important clinical implications, as it appears that using the average scan to accumulate dose may result in a poor representation of the actual dose delivered to the patient. Furthermore, many of the dose distributions arising from the average treatment end up violating the clinical criteria for acceptability, even if the breathing pattern is inside the uncertainty set. On the other hand, the robust treatment satisfies the clinical criteria under all scenarios and generally dominates the average treatment. The performance of the robust solution pushes the efficient frontier towards the ABC solution, which is the dominant method from a dosimetric perspective.

                         surround an exhale-weighted nominal PMF, they are “conservative” uncertainty sets. In this case, “conservative” refers less to the size of the uncertainty set – traditional robust optimization produces more conservative solutions given larger uncertainty sets – and more to the nature of the solution should the uncertain data be realized outside the uncertainty set, rather than inside. Recall that the heart generally receives the most dose in the exhale phase. Therefore, an exhale-weighted uncertainty set focuses on protecting against uncertainty in the case where heart dose is generally higher. When a PMF is realized outside of the uncertainty set, it has a higher chance of being inhale-weighted, which results in lower heart dose. In other words, PMFs realized inside the uncertainty set will result in the worst heart dose, and other PMFs can only improve on what was planned.

                        ).

First, notice that the planned dose distribution corresponding to the robust solution is always inside the range of the realized distribution for all metrics. On the other hand, the planned dose corresponding to the average solution can be quite different (both higher and lower) than the realized interval. This observation confirms that our robust-CVaR framework provides a better, more stable estimate of the realized dose. Another observation is that the realized robust dose distributions meet the clinical criteria in almost all of the simulated cases, generally outperforming the average solution. Finally, note that (w-CVaR) formulation dominates the average method in all metrics for all PMFs, but only slightly reduces the heart dose; wherase (CVaR-a) formulation reduces the heart dose more, by giving up a small (clinically acceptable) amount of CTV dose for some breathing patterns. The reason is that (CVaR-a) formulation is less conservative on the target coverage compared to (w-CVaR) formulation, and therefore can reduce the dose to the heart while maintaining clinical target coverage for breathing patterns within the uncertainty set.

Lastly, in Fig. 5
                        , we show dose-volume histograms associated with the average and (CVaR-a) models using the simulated PMFs inside 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    5
                                 
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    10
                                 
                              
                           
                        . The results for (w-CVaR) formulation are similar. The horizontal axis of a DVH is dose, and the vertical axis is the percentage of the volume of an organ receiving that amount of dose or higher. For the average model (Fig. 5(a) and (b)), we see that the realized dose distribution on the breast is worse than what was planned. Similarly, we see a substantial difference between the planned and realized dose-volume curves for the heart. This difference indicates that the planned dose distribution on the average scan is not always a reliable indicator of what the actual delivered dose will be, highlighting a drawback of using the average method to do treatment planning. On the other hand, Fig. 5(c) and (d) shows that our robust-CVaR model can generate a planned dose distribution that is a better estimate of the actual delivered dose, even in the face of uncertainty.

Here, we expand on the clinical implications of the results seen in Section 5. Recall that we set out to develop an optimization-based IMRT treatment planning method for left-sided breast cancer that combines the advantages of the average and ABC methods. Our robust-CVaR treatments can be delivered during free breathing for any patient (like the average method) and produces dose distributions that push the frontier forward and towards the ABC dose distribution. While the average method often results in dose distributions that violate the clinical criteria, the robust treatments almost always satisfy the criteria. Furthermore, the robust treatments have the benefit of improved predictability between the planned and realized dose distributions.

The robust-CVaR method is also implicitly advocating for the use of 4D-CT imaging in breast cancer patients. If patients are given 4D-CT scans, better measurement of the true amount of heart in the radiation field is possible, which may allow treatment planners to refer fewer patients to ABC (as long as dose criteria are met) and possibly reduce the burden on the resources of the health system. Although 4D-CT scans result in a little more dose being delivered to the patient in comparison to a regular CT scan, it is possible that this increase is more than offset by a reduction in dose delivered to critical organs, made possible by the robust-CVaR method. This hypothesis should be tested in a more clinically oriented study on a large cohort of patient data, which would also serve to validate our findings more broadly. This idea is a topic of future study.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we develop two robust-CVaR definitions for formulating the tail of a loss distribution under uncertainty. We use a novel interpretation of a system with a loss distribution that is state dependent and the time spent in each state is uncertain. The cumulative loss depends on the uncertain fraction of time the system spends in each state. Our robust-CVaR framework generalizes existing models in the literature and is less conservative than worst-case methods.

We demonstrate an application of our framework to the IMRT treatment planning problem of breast cancer where we optimize the tails of the distribution of dose under uncertainty in the patient’s breathing pattern. Our model generalizes two existing clinical methods and has advantages of both – deliverability while the patient is breathing freely and improved cardiac sparing. Our computational results demonstrate improved dosimetric performance over the standard treatment planning method under free breathing.

This section describes the clinical data and parameter value settings used in the computational experiments. A 4D-CT dataset from a left-sided breast cancer patient was obtained from Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. The heart, lung and CTV were contoured on each phase of the 4D-CT scan. To keep track of the deformation between the voxels of all phases, the contours on the inhale scan of the 4D-CT were deformed over five phases so that the fifth phase replicated the exhale scan of the 4D-CT. The average scan was also available with the actual planned dose for this patient. Since this patient was not classified as an ABC patient, the inhale scan of the 4D-CT was used to generate the ABC results. The contours were imported into MATLAB (2013) using the Computation Environment for Radiotherapy Research (CERR) software package (Deasy, Blanco, & Clark, 2003). CERR was also used to calculate the dose-influence matrices. The upper and lower dose-volume criteria for the CTV were used as hard constraints and the only objective was minimizing the dose to the heart. That is,

We compared the results of solving an instance of the full-sized problem with those of the sampled problem, and there was negligible difference in the DVHs. Thus we used the sampled voxel set for all the computational experiments.
