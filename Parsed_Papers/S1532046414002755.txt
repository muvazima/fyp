                  An empirical method of sample size determination for building prediction models was proposed recently. Permutation method which is used in this procedure is a commonly used method to address the problem of overfitting during cross-validation while evaluating the performance of prediction models constructed from microarray data. But major drawback of such methods which include bootstrapping and full permutations is prohibitively high cost of computation required for calculating the sample size.
                  In this paper, we propose that a single representative null distribution can be used instead of a full permutation by using both simulated and real data sets. During simulation, we have used a dataset with zero effect size and confirmed that the empirical type I error approaches to 0.05. Hence this method can be confidently applied to reduce overfitting problem during cross-validation. We have observed that pilot data set generated by random sampling from real data could be successfully used for sample size determination. We present our results using an experiment that was repeated for 300 times while producing results comparable to that of full permutation method. Since we eliminate full permutation, sample size estimation time is not a function of pilot data size. In our experiment we have observed that this process takes around 30min.
                  With the increasing number of clinical studies, developing efficient sample size determination methods for building prediction models is critical. But empirical methods using bootstrap and permutation usually involve high computing costs. In this study, we propose a method that can reduce required computing time drastically by using representative null distribution of permutations. We use data from pilot experiments to apply this method for designing clinical studies efficiently for high throughput data.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the main reasons to utilize high dimensional data from microarrays in clinical research is to develop statistical models that predict clinical outcomes such as, time to recurrence, progression of disease and survival of patients. Finding high quality samples is costly and difficult but it constitutes a key task in performing clinical studies. The task of finding minimum number of samples for scientific study is very important to minimize the wastage of valuable resources and retain clinical utility of the experiment. Determination of sample size based on sound technical basis is a significant part of guidelines set by Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Several important methodologies were proposed to determine sample size for microarray experiments. Liu and Hwang report a formula suitable for comparison studies with multiple independent samples [1]. Methods which introduce the concept of controlling False Discovery Rate (FDR) in microarray analysis were further developed to estimate power and sample size [2–5]. These methods are aimed at discovering statistically valid biomarkers. However, because of the inherent complexities in the genetic make-up of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and other immune diseases these methods suffer from less-than-desirable accuracy for medical practice. This implies that one has to consider the necessity of multiple parameters in the prediction models, as well as the variations from experimental platform. Recent FDA clearance of Affymetrix™ system as a diagnostic platform presents an example of rapid upgrade in reliability of such platforms for use in clinical settings [6]. Statistical prediction models such as one used in OncotypeDX™ which employs multiple biomarkers validate the value of such predictive models. These models have formed a trend in many clinical trials in combination with co-diagnosis approach [7,8].

Recently, Pang and Jung provided an idea to rigorously determine the sample size required to construct such a predictive model [9]. It estimates empirical power of a suggested sample size using simulated data from bootstrapping based on a predictive model developed using pilot project data. A proof was given by Jung and Young [10] that demonstrates the structure of covariance from pilot data and bootstrapped data from the pilot data are approximately identical. They also suggest a method to estimate empirical power when the response variable is of survival type. Since this method constructs individual prediction models from numerous simulated data sets and performs cross-validation and permutation each time, it reduces the problem of over-fitting while adding expensive computation time for repeated calculations.

The concept of prediction–validation method is the first of its kind to determine the sample size of multi-dimensional data [9]. However, it remains a concern that it requires lot of time to determine proper sample size of a data set with many variables. This approach would be more practical if the computation complexity could be reduced. We were inspired by an observation that a set of simulated data sets from pilot data seem to generate similar non-centrality parameters when each set was estimated by maximum likelihood method. Thus, it seemed reasonable to assume that a carefully selected single null distribution could be re-used in other sets for adjusting 
                        
                           p
                        
                     -values. Our current study provides a method to determine sample size for the case of binary response variables using this idea. We demonstrate empirical evidence by extensive simulation which supports the fact that sample size can be conveniently approximated.

@&#METHODS@&#

It is known that statistical power can be estimated from a number of simulated data by bootstrapping based on a prediction model from pilot data. A prediction model is constructed for each simulated data. Validation of the models can estimate the empirical power from the ratio of valid models over the total set of simulated data [9]. We carry out a 
                        
                           
                              
                                 χ
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                     -test for each model from a simulated data and regard the model to be valid when the 
                        
                           p
                        
                     -value is less than the significance level of 0.05. This procedure heavily depends on repeated CV with permutation on simulated data. Consequently, it results in immense computational cycles which prohibit practical applications of this method.

We have created a representative permutation null distribution from one randomly chosen simulated data among those of showing the highest marginal frequency within the group of whole simulated data. Details of each step to determine this null distribution is explained in the following section.

In order to estimate empirical power, many simulated data sets are required. A small-sized pilot data is defined as

It is possible to determine the minimum sample size whose power exceeds the pre-determined power,

                         when using the suggested method of power estimation. This procedure can be further optimized by utilizing binary search algorithm in order to search the minimum sample size. Considering that power estimation is the most time consuming task, starting to search for the smallest 
                           
                              N

                              N
                           
                         can contribute to reduction of calculation time. Since it is known that a sample size determination without permutation underestimates the sample size, one can start searching at a larger number than the underestimated sample size, and can expect reduction of time for searching.

We followed a similar approach for constructing covariance matrices but reduced the size of the covariance matrix for the ease of calculation [11,12]. According to Guo et al. [11], this correlation structure provides a reasonable basis since some group of genes are connected each other in their pathways and there are weaker relationships between gene groups. That is the reason why the correlations between groups are zero. And the basic assumption within group is that the gene order has some meaning so that the correlations decline exponentially with respect to the difference between indices. Here we impose more variability by generating common correlation coefficient

                         from uniform distribution since the correlation coefficient is between −1 and 1 and by varying the block size. Also we ease and include another correlation structure which is described in Section 4 and Appendix B.

                         of 1000 genes were generated. Each simulated data set used top 3 of the most significant genes from univariate analyses of 1000 genes to construct a multiple logistic regression model. This model was used to perform 3-fold CV and estimated

                         predicted outcome values followed by the procedure described in Section 2.3. The power is the ratio of valid predictions determined by chi-square statistic over 1000 data sets. We reduced the overfitting of our model by CV with permutation [9], and confirmed that type I error was 0.047. This is closer to the preset significance level of 0.05 than 0.106 which is estimated without permutation, that is, naive use of chi-squared distribution with 1degree of freedom as a null distribution of 2×2 contingency table.

One unavoidable drawback of this procedure is high computing cost for permutations. Our main idea to reduce the cost of permutation is to perform permutation only once with a representative bootstrap data, and reuse null distribution for other data sets. It is based on this insight that the whole simulated data sets were generated from a single pilot data and thus they can be represented by a single null distribution. This is visible in a plot of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of non-central

                        -distributions from permutation null distributions using 1000 simulated data sets. (Appendix A).

A probable representative simulated data set can be selected with one that has the most common null distribution among 1000 data sets. This is the case with microarray data, where only response variables are shuffled. It means that, if the frequencies of 0’s and 1’s in the response variable of two bootstrap data are the same, they will share a null distribution. Histograms in Fig. 1
                         are frequencies of marginal sums with

                         is located around 25. (Appendix D) This subset of simulated data is consisted of 121 data sets. Since our basic strategy to select representative null distribution is random selection from them, we try to check whether this random selection affects the level of significance or not. We obtained all 121 power values assuming that each and every bootstrapped data is used to calculated permutation null distribution. The 121 estimated power values have mean of 0.044 and standard deviation of 0.012. A more accurate empirical power based on CV with full permutation gives 0.047 while the significance level is 0.05.

The empirical power is shown as a horizontal reference line at 0.047 in Fig. 1(a). Depending on the marginal sum of the selected data set, the mean power approximation (solid line) is near the reference power at marginal sum of 25, and the standard deviation (dashed line) is less than or close to 0.01.

                        ), and rest have 0. The power was 0.909 when calculated by full permutation method. The estimation of power based on our proposed method using representative null distribution is 0.903±0.010 (mean±sd). The variation is small enough to allow reliable power estimation and sample size determination. This implies that it is possible to perform robust power estimation irrespective of the selection of simulated data sets. We also generated simulated data sets by using other methods included in Cai et al. and Pang et al. [9,13], and these data sets also lead to the same conclusion (Appendices B and D).

A closer look at our newly suggested method to observe the robustness against the perturbation of parameters is carried out as follows. Before a series of simulations were performed, we generated 100 pilot data sets each for 27 combinations of three parameters by varying size of the pilot data with (

                        ) among genes gets larger is also visible. This trend is present when beta is increased, and is shown in Fig. 2 and Appendix C. They also show another trend that larger beta results in smaller determines of sample size as expected.

We used the data from Christensen et al. and Gravier et al. to apply our sample size determination method [14,15]. Gravier et al. data was obtained from patients with early stage small, invasive ductal carcinomas (T1T2N0) with no auxiliary lymph node involvement to investigate the metastasis of small node-negative breast carcinoma. High dimensional experimental data was produced from 168 patients using array-CGH. This data set contains genome information with 2905 features for each individual. 111 patients have no metastasis and the rests (57) are of poor prognosis with early metastasis (data source: https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray/blob/master/data/gravier.RData).

Christensen et al. compared CpG methylation patterns in 217 pairs of cancer and normal tissues. They used Illumina GoldenGate methylation bead array for data production which included 1413 sites within 773 genes (data source: https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray/blob/master/data/christensen.RData).

We randomly selected 50 patients each from the data used by Gravier et al. to construct one of our pilot data sets. Same procedure of obtaining the representative null distribution and power was applied, and the results match to that of our simulations. We repeated the same procedure with the data used by Christensen et al. and their histograms and power values from full permutation method are shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d).

In order to estimate the most desirable size of a pilot data and the number of repeats for sample size calculation, we randomly selected pilot data sets of size 
                           
                              m
                           
                         (
                           
                              m
                              =
                              30
                              ,
                              50
                              ,
                              70
                           
                        ) from a pool of Gravier et al.’s 168 patients’ microarray data, and determined the sample size for each pilot data. For each 
                           
                              m
                           
                        , 300 pilot data were generated for repeated sample size calculation. A single sample size determination from pilot data involved multiple power calculations using 1000 bootstrap data and representative null distribution of permutations.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the distribution of 300 determined sample sizes which appear to have larger variance than expected from simulation. As the pilot data size increases, mean of the determined sample sizes also tend to increase. Since small pilot data sizes impose a disadvantage of poor representation of the population, it results in increase of variance in sample sizes. It is possible to achieve the targeted power threshold by observing the change of sample size variance and adjusting the size of bootstrap data iteratively.

Determination of sample size requires pilot data and this is true for both full permutation method and our method. It is hard to predict a reasonable size of a pilot data set. We decided to follow the examples of previous studies, in which the pilot data size were about 50. It is possible to consider using public data, if it exists, as a pilot data set, which shares the platform and disease type, etc.

As computational cost is a critical factor to highlight the practicality of this method, we present our computational resources and results in this section. We have used 8 cores (Intel Xeon CPU E5-2690 2.90GHz, dual 4 cores CPU) for parallel processing. Our method to calculate sample size took about 30min. This is a drastically improvement when compared to the CPU time required for full permutations method (Table 1
                        ). The calculation was performed using a parallel processing machine. The amount of total CPU time was obtained by adding up CPU times reported by individual CPU’s within the parallel machine. This was due to the restriction by the supercomputer center that prohibits jobs running for an unbearably long time when run in a single CPU mode.

In Section 3.1 we can verify that the type I error is controlled. To confirm whether type I error is affected by correlation structure or not, we also generated simulated data sets followed by the correlation structure used other methods included in Cai et al. [13], Pang et al. [9], and the most general case (no structure but positive definite). We compared the powers from full permutation to proposed method (Appendix B). The results are shows that type I error is controlled and the similar results as in Fig. 1(a).

We provide Appendix E where we compared empirical powers between naive use of chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom and use of the representative null distribution under various situations. The powers increase as the number of folds increase without a control of type I error if we use naive chi-squared distribution as the null distribution. The powers are slightly less when using 2 or 10 folds CV than 3 or 5 folds. Besides, the 3-fold CV gives the smaller standard deviation, therefore, we use 3-fold CV to evaluate. This is empirical evidence of overfitting of CV method and makes use of permutation null distribution necessary.

A new paradigm of introducing genome-wide data in search of new markers has emerged and presents us with products that use multiple clinical diagnostic markers. These products seem to promise higher potential and further utility since they can reflect the correlation between multiple genes involved in disease mechanisms.

The proposed method of sample size determination can be adopted by studies that try to develop multiple marker prediction models, and it is especially appropriate for clinical studies with many binary variables. It still remains a hurdle that the variance of calculated sample size from real data (Gravier et al.’s) is larger than that of simulated calculations. However, it is not difficult to resolve this issue since sample size calculations form a normal distribution and the variance can be reduced by taking the mean of the sample size estimates. Fig. 3 depicts the distribution of sample size estimates that resemble normal distribution. We have tried repeating the sample size determination by 3, 5 and 10 times to reduce the variance and obtain the estimator close to mean. This procedure is a cost effective option compared to performing full permutation method.

Our suggested method enables practical sample size determination by allowing calculation in less than 10 repetitions. A realistic scenario of performing microarray experiments are usually made up of several batches, thus sample size determination can be performed as each batch is added without difficulty during the initial stage of a clinical research.
