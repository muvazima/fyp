                  This paper deals with portfolio selection problems under risk and ambiguity. The investor may be ambiguous with respect to the set of states of nature and their probabilities. Both static and discrete or continuous time dynamic pricing models are included in the analysis. Risk and ambiguity are measured in general settings. The considered risk measures contain, as particular cases, the usual deviations and the coherent and expectation bounded measures of risk.
                  Four contributions seem to be reached. Firstly, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are given. Secondly, the portfolio selection problem may be frequently solved by linear programming linked methods, despite the fact that risk and ambiguity cannot be given by linear expressions. Thirdly, if there is a market price of risk then there exists a benchmark that creates a robust capital market line when combined with the riskless asset. The global risk of every portfolio may be divided into systemic and specific. Moreover, if there is no ambiguity with respect to the states of nature (only their probabilities are uncertain), then classical CAPM-formulae may be found. Fourthly, some recent pathological findings for ambiguity-free analyses also apply in ambiguous frameworks. In particular, there may exist arbitrage free markets such that the ambiguous agent can guarantee every expected return with a maximum risk bounded from above by zero, i.e. , the capital market line (risk, return) becomes vertical. For instance, in the (non-ambiguous) Black and Scholes model this property holds for important risk measures such as the absolute deviation or the CVaR. Nevertheless, in ambiguous settings, adequate increments of the ambiguity level will allow us to recover capital market lines consistent with the empirical evidence. The introduction of ambiguity may overcome several caveats of many important pricing models.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Most of the financial problems involving capital markets deal with probabilities of states of nature. Both the set of states of nature and their probabilities must be estimated and may incorporate measurement errors. The presence of ambiguity (or agents with multiple priors) is usual in economics and finance (Hansen & Sargent, 2012), and it affects many pricing and equilibrium problems, as well as investment decisions. Many recent papers are focusing on these issues. For instance, Riedel (2009) dealt with optimal stopping in an ambiguous framework, and Bossaerts, Ghirardato, Guarnaschelli, and Zame (2010) studied the impact of ambiguity and ambiguity aversion on equilibrium asset prices. With regard to portfolio selection problems, Garlappi, Uppal, and Wang (2007) dealt with ambiguous expected returns and empirically showed that, compared with portfolios from classical and Bayesian models, ambiguity aversion leads to optimal solutions that are more stable over time and deliver higher out-of sample Sharpe ratios. In this sense, the introduction of uncertainty may be more than realistic and could be also interesting to many traders.

Every capital market problem must deal with a risk measurement method. The standard deviation has been the main risk measure due to its good analytical properties. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence, the fast evolution of capital markets, and the growing presence of asymmetric returns make it necessary the use of more complex measures of risk. Ogryczak and Ruszczynski (1999) have pointed out the lack of consistency between the standard deviation and the second order stochastic dominance if asymmetric returns are involved. Besides, in a non-Gaussian world the standard deviation is not perfectly correlated with potential capital losses, which is an important disadvantage with respect to other risk measures such as the value at risk (VaR). As a consequence, risk measurement beyond the variance has become very important in finance, as shown by the recent literature. For instance, Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, and Heath (1999) introduced the coherent measures of risk, Rockafellar, Uryasev, and Zabarankin (2006) defined the deviation measures and the expectation bounded risk measures, Zhiping and Wang (2008) defined the two-sided coherent risk measures, Brown and Sim (2009) defined the satisfying measures, and Bali, Cakici, and Chabi-Yo (2011) provided measures of riskiness.

Many classical financial topics have been revisited using risk measures. With respect to portfolio choice problems, among many others, Zhiping and Wang (2008) presented very general analyses, and Bali et al. (2011) pointed out how the empirical results indicate that some generalized measures of riskiness are very appropriate to rank equity portfolios based on their expected returns per unit of risk. Nevertheless, Balbás, Balbás, and Balbás (2010) proved the existence of caveats affecting the most important arbitrage free pricing models of Financial Economics. For instance, for the Black and Scholes model, and for every coherent and expectation bounded measure of risk, investors can build portfolios with the intended expected return (as large as desired) and non-positive risk (equal to or lower than zero). This pathological finding also holds if one combines Black and Scholes with VaR, and it is not easily overcome if one incorporates “reasonable” transaction costs (Balbás, Balbás, & Balbás, 2013).

Recent literature has also focused on robust portfolio choice with both ambiguity and general risk measures. In particular, Schied (2007) establishes duality linked optimality conditions, Zhu and Fukushima (2009) yield algorithms to minimize the worst-case (or robust) conditional value at risk (CVaR) if the set of priors satisfies some required assumptions, and Chen, He, and Zhang (2013), Scutellà and Recchia (2013) and Maillet, Tokpavi, and Vaucher (2015) deal with general asset allocation problems.

This paper focuses on robust portfolio selection and attempts to address several open problems arising from the discussion above. Indeed, we will consider a general risk measure and an ambiguous framework and study three main problems: The existence of indices or benchmarks providing us with the set of optimal portfolios, extensions of the classical CAPM, and the caveat above of Balbás et al. (2010), and Balbás et al. (2013). This economic meaningless equality

                        The notion of good deal was introduced by Cochrane and Saa-Requejo (2000). Mainly, a good deal was an investment strategy providing traders with a “very high return/risk ratio” , in comparison with the Market Portfolio. Risk was measured with the standard deviation, and the absence of good deal was imposed so as to price in an incomplete arbitrage free model.
                        In this paper we deal with alternative risk measures and identify the concept of good deal with a strategy yielding an infinite return/risk ratio.
                     
                  

With respect to the ambiguity, we consider a very general case because it may affect both the set of states of nature and the probabilities of the states. Obviously, this framework contains more restricted approaches dealing with ambiguity with respect to volatilities, expected returns, covariances, etc.
                  

The paper’s outline is as follows. Section 2 is devoted to summarizing the basic notions and notations, as well as some background. The robust portfolio selection problem is introduced and studied in Sections 3 and 4. As usual in finance, ambiguity aversion is incorporated by dealing with the worst-case principle, as justified in Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989). Though there are alternative methods also consistent with the famous Ellsberg paradox, most of the authors adopt a worst-case approach; for instance, all of the ambiguity-linked papers cited above.

Our portfolio choice problem minimizes the robust (worst-case) risk for every robust expected return. Though this is not a linear problem, we extend the approach of Balbás et al. (2010) in risk minimization so as to involve ambiguity too. Consequently, we find a dual problem that characterizes the primal solutions and may be analyzed with linear programming methods. This seems to be a good news because there are very efficient algorithms to solve linear problems in both finite and infinite-dimensional frameworks (Anderson & Nash, 1987). Theorems 3 and 4 are the most important results of Section 3, since they provide optimality conditions for both the robust portfolio selection problem and its dual. In Remark 3 we draw on the optimality conditions in order to address our three major objectives: The existence of robust good deals, the existence of appropriate benchmarks under the robust good deal absence, and the CAPM-like formulae. Four disjoint and complementary results may arise. Firstly, if the investor reflects a high level of uncertainty (the set of priors is large and contains the stochastic discount factor of the pricing model), then the market is risk neutral for this investor. This means that there are no worst-case expected returns higher than the risk-free rate, and therefore the investor has no incentives to buy risky assets. This result seems to be consistent with the theoretical and empirical findings of Cao, Wang, and Zhang (2005) and Bossaerts et al. (2010). Agents who are sufficiently ambiguity averse find open sets of prices for which they refuse to hold an ambiguous portfolio or choose not to participate in the stock market. Secondly, if the set of priors of the investor is lower, then he/she can find a benchmark that generates a robust capital market line (CML) when combined with the riskless security. This market line provides a robust market price of risk (the relationship between the worst-case expected return and the worst-case risk), as well as the systemic and specific robust risk of every asset. Furthermore, if there is no ambiguity with respect to the states of nature, and only their probabilities are uncertain, then for every available security (or portfolio) the investor may measure two “betas” (regression coefficients) with respect to the benchmark, which allow her/him to give lower and upper bounds for the worst-case expected return. This is an obvious extension of the classical CAPM formulae (Theorem 9) holding for ambiguous settings and expectation bounded risk measures or deviation measures. For efficient strategies both betas become identical, and so do the lower/upper bound above. Two numerical experiments involving the binomial pricing model and real market data, respectively, illustrate our findings of Sections 3 and 4, as well as the relevance of the presence of ambiguity.

The third and fourth cases in Remark 3 lead to the existence of robust good deals. If the investor uncertainty is “too low” then the stochastic discount factor may be in the frontier or outside a set of linear envelopes of the risk measure. If it is in the frontier then the couple

                      is available, and there is a robust good deal of the second type.

In Section 5 we attempt to overcome the presence good deals. The main result is Theorem 10. It shows that there is a very important difference between the ambiguous and the non-ambiguous setting. Under ambiguity, if we properly increment the set of priors, then the absence of good deal is guaranteed. Furthermore, the enlargement of the degree of ambiguity may be done in such a manner that the new robust capital market line and the new robust market price of risk may be as close as possible to those reflected by the empirical evidence of the investor. In this sense, the introduction of ambiguity may overcome several caveats of many important arbitrage free pricing models of Financial Economics, such as Black and Scholes, Heston, etc. By adding ambiguity these models stop reflecting the presence of good deal when risks are measured by coherent and expectation bounded risk measures. Two numerical experiments involving the binomial pricing model and real market data illustrate the most important findings of Section 5.

The last section of the paper summarizes the most important conclusions, and the appendix contains the data associated with the empirical implementations.

                              There exists an extension

                                    Y

                              . Furthermore, Π is linear, continuous and positive.


                        Assumption 1 obviously holds if the initial market is already complete (for instance, in the binomial or the Black and Scholes models), in which case 
                           
                              Y
                              =
                              
                                 L
                                 2
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              Π
                              =
                              π
                           
                        . Incomplete markets may satisfy the existence of Π as well. For example, if the set Ω only contains finitely many states then L
                        2 becomes a finite-dimensional space, and the existence of Π holds if π is arbitrage free (Harrison & Kreps, 1979). If Ω contains infinitely many states then the existence of Π is also possible. For instance, though “formally” stochastic volatility models are incomplete, in practice it is assumed the existence of volatility dependent assets making them complete. Otherwise it would be impossible to use these models so as to give a unique price of the usual derivatives. Further details about the existence of Π under general conditions for Ω may be found in Luenberger (2001).

In practical situations there could be ambiguous investors whose set of priors could be non-convex or non-weakly compact. For mathematical reasons we have to impose both convexity and weak compactness. Otherwise the results of this paper would become false. Nevertheless, if a set of priors

                         though we will not address this approach in order to simplify the mathematical exposition. If 
                           
                              
                                 C

                         replaced 
                           K
                         then there would not be any essential modification of the worst-case risk and the worst-case expected return, since, as it will be seen, both risk and return have linear approximations (see Definition 1 and Theorems 1 and 2 below) and maximize/minimize in extreme points (which belong to 
                           K
                        ). A particular interesting case arises for a finite set of priors 
                           
                              K
                              ,
                           
                         since every finite set has a compact convex hull.


                        Assumptions 1 and 2 imply that the ambiguous trader is not sure about the physical probabilities of the states on nature, but the risk neutral probabilities (and therefore prices) are clear enough. There may be two reasons. Firstly, the trader may be dealing with securities whose quotations are available and given by the market, though the probabilities of their final pay-off may contain estimation errors. Example 2 in Remark 7 and Example 4 in Remark 9 will illustrate this situation. Secondly, physical probabilities are usually estimated with historical data (Trolle & Schwartz, 2009), while risk neutral ones are often computed by calibration to market prices (Trolle & Schwartz, 2009). Assumptions 1 and 2 indicate that the trader is provided with a significant quantity of real quotations, and he/she can calibrate the pricing model. Historical data may reflect special frameworks which do not apply now. The evolution of macro-economic variables and markets is very dynamic, and it is not always guaranteed that past data will reflect the present framework. Example 1 (Remark 7) and Example 3 (Remark 9) are toy cases which may help to understand this case.

Let us follow the approach of Artzner et al. (1999) and Rockafellar et al. (2006) in order to introduce risk functions. Thus, a risk measure will be a function

As said in the introduction, the Ellsberg paradox indicates the presence of ambiguity aversion, which may be incorporated by dealing with the worst-case principle (Gilboa & Schmeidler, 1989). A consistent way to consider this principle is to define “the robust extension of a risk measure relative to the set of priors 
                           K
                        ” . For instance, the robust CVaR with confidence level 0 ≤ μ < 1 relative to the set of priors 
                           K

Though there are very interesting alternative definitions of the robust CVaR (Lagos, Espinoza, Moreno, & Vielma, 2015; Zhu & Fukushima, 2009), we have selected the version (13) of Balbás, Balbás, Balbás, and Heras (2015) because it properly fits the framework of this paper, as justified by Theorem 1 below whose proof, under minor modifications, may be found in this reference.

                        respectively. The absolute deviation is consistent with the usual utility functions, but the standard deviation only satisfies this property for symmetric returns (Ogryczak & Ruszczynski, 1999). Since symmetric returns are difficult to find under ambiguity, let us focus on the absolute deviation and adapt Theorem 1 to this dispersion measure. The proof is similar to that of Theorem 1, and therefore it will be omitted.

                         and Δρ
                         could be identical, since they could be representing similar notions. Let us indicate that

                         see (12)), though we have preferred to deal with more general cases and give Definition 1 as it is. Anyway, we recognize that the economic literature did not solve the relationships/differences between risk and uncertainty yet, and further discussions will be expected in the near future. Secondly, there are alternative uncertainty/risk measures which are not expectation bounded, and therefore they do not satisfy Definition 1. Interesting examples are, for instance, those measures related to the notion of entropy (see Kullback and Leibler (1951), for information-linked studies, or Kupper and Schachermayer (2009), for risk-linked ones). Many results of this paper may be extended to more general frameworks, but not them all. Therefore, further research about portfolio selection under risk and uncertainty will be required in the near future too.

                     y being the decision variable. The ambiguous agent is minimizing the robust risk in the set Y of attainable pay-offs whose price is not higher than one dollar (first constraint) and whose expected return will be at least r regardless of the real probability that explains the market behavior (second constraint). Thus, the solution y
                     * of (16) will guarantee (at least) the robust (or worst-case) expected return r, and a real risk never higher than ρ(y
                     *). In this sense, the uncertainty (or ambiguity) does not impede guaranteeing a lower bound for the expected return with an upper bound for the global risk. We will assume that the investor desires at least the return of the riskless asset, so

There are very interesting algorithms permitting us to solve linear optimization problems in both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional settings (Anderson & Nash, 1987). Though (21) is not linear because the constraint contains the product λf of two variables, under adequate conditions for 
                              K
                            and ρ it becomes linear if one fixes 
                              
                                 λ
                                 =
                                 
                                    λ
                                    1

                            and then deals with the resulting problem (21-λ
                           1) involving only the decision variables (f, z). The existence of feasible solutions (f, z) for (21-λ
                           1) is easy to verify. Indeed, since ( 21-λ
                           1) is linear it has a linear dual (Anderson & Nash, 1987), and, under weak conditions, (21-λ
                           1) is feasible if and only if its dual is bounded. If so, λ
                           1 is not the optimal value of (21), so we must select an increment α > 0 and take

                            of (25) and (26) give the relationship between the optimal robust risk and its associated robust expected return. Nevertheless, the existence of good deals of the first (H2B) or second (H3) type frequently holds. For instance, in the non-ambiguous case, Balbás et al. (2010) have proved that the Black and Scholes model generates good deals for every coherent and expectation bounded risk measure and for the absolute deviation. Moreover, if the selected risk measure is the CVaR then this pricing model generates good deals of the second type (H3). This caveat also applies for many stochastic volatility pricing models.

We will devote this section to dealing with Case H2A. Accordingly, throughout this section (f

                     * is a priced one portfolio due to (6) and the third condition in (20 ). We will see that y
                     * may be understood as a benchmark, in the sense that the efficient strategies will be combinations of y
                     * and the riskless asset. Since the framework we are dealing with is very general, it is not possible to give a general distribution of y
                     *, as it will be pointed out in Remark 7 and Example 1 below.


                     Proposition 6 and Remark 5 below are very similar to parallel findings of Balbás et al. (2010) for the ambiguity free case, but we will include their proofs in our new context.

                           will be said to be its specific risk. Obviously, the inequality in (30) shows that “the market does not pay anything” for the specific risk, since the efficient portfolio of Proposition 6 guarantees the same robust return r and it only reflects the systemic risk of y.

The remark above shows that y
                     * describes the set of efficient strategies and yields the proportion of the risk of every portfolio that is related to its robust return. Next, let us see that some kind of “beta” between an arbitrary portfolio y and the benchmark y
                     * may explain the worst-case return guaranteed by y. The interest of such a result is clear, and it is very appreciated in the financial literature. In fact, many papers analyze the existence of extensions of the classical CAPM-formulae for non-ambiguous settings and general risk measures. For instance, among many others, Balbás et al. (2010) find extensions for coherent risk measures and expectation bounded risk measures, while Zabarankin, Pavlikov, and Uryasev (2014) deal with risk measures related to the drawdown function.

Notice that Theorem 9 above extends important results of previous literature. For instance, (34) becomes the CAPM-like formulae of Zabarankin et al. (2014) for non-ambiguous frameworks, efficient portfolios and risk measures related to the drawdown function. Similarly, in the non-ambiguous case

                                    1
                                    }
                                 
                                 ,
                              
                            
                           (34) holds and is the CAPM-like formulae of Balbás et al. (2010) for deviations and risk measures beyond the variance. In both particular cases (y is efficient or the investor is not ambiguous) we have the equality 
                              
                                 f

                            and therefore (34) holds. In general, the fulfillment of the equality

                            cannot be characterized, and (33) is the expression. Portfolio y and the benchmark y
                           * do not have to be associated with the same “worst prior” with respect to the robust expectation (29).

Let us consider two numerical examples illustrating the ideas of Sections 3 and 4, Example 1 is a toy pricing process related to the classical binomial model, and our only purpose is to clarify the main ideas of this paper. Example 2 is a static approach in the usual line of many classical applications of Operational Research and Optimization Theory in Portfolio Choice Problems.

In particular, the ambiguous investor reaches more acceptable prices of risk because the estimation

We have empirically tested the findings above by dealing with biweekly data related to five future markets. The database is provided in the appendix, and it involves the quotations of three international stock indices (

                           -500, EUROSTOXX-50 and DAX-30) and two commodities (Gold and Brent) in 2010. Since there are 27 quotations we have 26 biweekly returns, which are easily transformed into equivalent annual returns. Therefore, as usual, the set Ω of estimated states on nature is finite and contains 26 elements. Furthermore, in an ambiguity free framework we can assume that the probability of every scenario equals 1/26. In such a case, if the selected risk measure is the CVaR with confidence level

Suppose now that the investor thinks that 3.0816 is a too big market price of risk according to her/his empirical evidence. He/she may decide to introduce ambiguity in the probabilities of the sates. Suppose that every probability is distorted according to a measurement error up to 10%. In other words, suppose that

                           with many components equaling 0.0423, which is 10% higher than 1/26 ≈ 0.0385. Similarly, the optimal portfolio y
                           * solving (16) may be easily computed by linear programming methods (see Corollary 5), and it is significantly different if one compares the non-ambiguous case and the ambiguous one of (43). As indicated in the first paragraph of this section, it is not possible to give a general distribution of the benchmark y
                           *. The obvious advantage of the ambiguous setting is given by the robustness of the conclusions for both optimal risk and optimal return.

Finally, notice that one can measure the sensitivity of M with respect to the ambiguity level, given by the constraint fj
                            ≤ 1.1 of (44). Indeed, the Envelope Theorem of Optimization Theory Balbás, Galperin, and Guerra (2005) allows us to measure the sensitivity between M and every parameter of (44). Nevertheless, we will not address this topic because an alternative approach will be presented in Section 5, where a close relationship between the ambiguity level and the robust market price of risk will be established.


                     Remark 3 leads to the existence of four disjoint and complementary scenarios. As stated in Theorem 9, the most natural one (H2A) implies some consequences quite parallel to those of the classical CAPM. Besides, H1 may be also natural. If the investor reflected high uncertainty, then it could be impossible to guarantee expected returns larger than the risk free rate (the 
                        
                           K
                           -
                           C
                           M
                           L
                        
                      is horizontal, and the market price of risk vanishes). The absence of worst-case expected returns higher than the riskless rate may imply that the investor has no incentives to buy risky assets. This result is consistent with the theoretical and empirical findings of Cao et al. (2005) and Bossaerts et al. (2010): “Agents who are sufficiently ambiguity averse find open sets of prices for which they refuse to hold an ambiguous portfolio or choose not to participate in the stock market” .

On the contrary, H2B or H3 implies the presence of good deals, which allow investors to construct portfolios whose robust expected return is as large as desired and whose robust risk is bounded from above (first type good deal, H2B) or as close to 
                        
                           −
                           ∞
                        
                      as desired (second type good deal, H3). This pathological finding has been already pointed out by Balbás et al. (2010). These authors do not consider any sort of ambiguity but they show that very important pricing models (Black and Scholes, Heston, etc.) imply the presence of good deals for every coherent and expectation bounded risk measure. Moreover, the existence of good deals is not easily overcome if one considers transaction costs (Balbás et al., 2013). It seems to be a serious shortcoming non-compatible with any kind of equilibrium, since agents should try to create good deals to become as rich as intended, regardless of the risk measure they are dealing with. Those securities composing the good deal should be traded with the appropriate sign (long or short), and consequently, the evolution of prices would provoke the good deal elimination. The purpose of this section is to prove that increments of the degree of ambiguity may be useful to recover the absence of good deals.

The presence of good deals indicates that the market price of risk is infinite. Since this should not be compatible with the equilibrium of capital markets, suppose that the empirical evidence provides the ambiguous investor with an estimation (or approximation) M of the real market price of risk, with 
                        
                           0
                           ≤
                           M
                           <
                           +
                           ∞
                        
                      (M is proportion between the increment of the optimal robust return and the increment of the optimal robust risk). Then, Theorem 10 below will show that adequate increments of the ambiguity level will lead to good deal free models whose market price of risk is “as close as possible” to M.

Though more general analyses may be presented, in order to simplify the mathematical exposition we will assume that

Consider the non-ambiguous case and the Black and Scholes pricing model. As indicated in Remark 4, Balbás et al. (2010) have shown the existence of second type good deals if the selected risk measure is the CVaR, and the existence of first type good deals for the absolute deviation. Since Theorems 1 and 2 prove the existence of appropriate robust generalizations of both risk measures, Theorem 10 above shows that this caveat will be solved if we introduce ambiguity on the probabilities of the states of nature generated by this very important pricing model. Similar comments apply for more complex stochastic volatility pricing models (Heston model, for instance) and risk measures (spectral measures, Wang measure, etc.).

Let us deal with the examples of Remark 7 in order to illustrate the implications of Theorem 10 in practice.

Consider the market of Example 1. The non-ambiguous agent could reach the market price of risk 
                              
                                 M
                                 =
                                 ∞
                              
                            (first type good deal), while the selected ambiguous one reached 
                              
                                 M

                           . The second value is more consistent with the economic intuition than the first one, but it might be “too small” . Suppose that the empirical estimation of a third ambiguous investor is that the market price of risk should be close to 
                              
                                 M

                                 5
                              
                            . Then, according to Theorem 10, the non-ambiguous set of priors 
                              
                                 K

                                    }
                                 
                              
                            may increase in such a manner that the robust market price of risk will be close to this empirical estimation. Actually, following the methods of Example 1, it is easy to see that for

This finding is obviously meaningless from a financial perspective, but Theorem 10 shows that this drawback can be overcome in an ambiguous framework. If we incorporate the ambiguity of Remark 7 given by (43), then we can solve (21) again (see Remark 2 ), but the problem still remains unbounded, so (46) still holds for more robust (risk, return) couples. A possible implication is that 10% may be a too small error when we estimate the real probabilities. Real committed errors may be much higher. Suppose that we enlarge the estimation error, which becomes 15%. Then (21) becomes bounded, but it leads to the huge market price of risk

It might be still a meaningless situation in practice, so the increment adhoc of the initial measurement error 10% may be a wrong solution of the caveat. Thus, let us deal with Theorem 10 in a more profound manner. We can enlarge the estimation error so as to be as close as possible to the empirical evidence about the real robust market price of risk. In particular, if we assume that

                           is a reasonable value, then we have to take an estimation error equaling 60%. In other words, with these data, only high levels of ambiguity will lead to realistic values of the market price of risk. The clear advantage is the high robustness of the reached Robust Capital Market Line, since the new guaranteed risks and returns will apply for a very large set of priors.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The presence of multiple priors is a common property affecting many investment decisions. Recent literature has addressed this problem from different perspectives. This paper considers the most general case because ambiguity may affect both the set of states of nature and the probabilities of the states. Obviously, this framework contains more restricted approaches dealing with ambiguity with respect to volatilities, expected returns, covariances, etc.
                  

In this setting a general portfolio choice problem has been studied. We minimize the guaranteed (or robust) risk for a given guaranteed (or robust) expected return. Depending on how large the investor uncertainty is, we have shown the existence of four disjoint and complementary possible results of the portfolio choice problem. Under the most realistic one there is a benchmark (or index) that creates a robust Capital Market Line when combined with the riskless asset. Consequently, there is a robust market price of risk for the investor with uncertainty, the global risk of every portfolio may be divided into systemic and specific, and no robust expected return is paid for the specific risk that can be diversified. Moreover, if there is no ambiguity with respect to the states of nature (only their probabilities are uncertain), then the classical CAPM-formulae may be extended to our general context. Thus, some correlations between every strategy and the benchmark allow us to explain this strategy robust expected return.

Two of the four complementary results above lead to the existence of robust good deals, i.e., the agent with uncertainty can guarantee every expected return with a maximum (or robust) risk bounded from above by zero. This drawback has already been pointed out for very important arbitrage free non-ambiguous pricing models. For instance, both the Black and Scholes model and the Heston model lead to this pathological situation. Nevertheless, there is a very important difference between the ambiguous and the non-ambiguous setting. If we increment the degree of ambiguity, i.e., if we increment the set of priors, then the absence of good deal is guaranteed. Furthermore, the enlargement of the degree of ambiguity may be done in such a manner that the new robust capital market line and the new robust market price of risk may be as close as possible to those reflected by the empirical evidence. In this sense, the introduction of ambiguity may overcome several caveats of many important pricing models. Illustrative numerical and empirical experiments of our findings have been provided.
