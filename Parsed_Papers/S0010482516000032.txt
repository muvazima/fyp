                  This paper presents a general half quadratic framework for simultaneous analysis of the whole array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) profiles in a data set. The proposed framework accommodates different M-estimation loss functions and two underlying assumptions for aCGH profiles of a data set: sparsity and low rank. Using M-estimation loss functions, this framework is more robust to various types of noise and outliers. The solution of the proposed framework is given by half quadratic (HQ) minimization. To hasten this procedure, accelerated proximal gradient (APG) is utilized. Experimental results support the robustness of the proposed framework in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Finding chromosomal aberrations is an important key to prognosticating and diagnosing various diseases such as cancer. Traditionally, finding these aberrations was accomplished by clinical scientists who were able to detect very little, subtle changes. However, the amount of material aberrations may be too small to be detected by a scientist under a microscope.

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a significant advancement in technology that can detect any small chromosome imbalance that cannot be detected by looking down a microscope. In fact, aCGH is a major approach for discovering copy number variations (CNVs). A CNV is defined as an alteration (gain or loss) in copies of a DNA segment [1].

The main challenge for detecting breakpoints is that aCGH profiles are highly corrupted by large noise and recovering true CNVs from noisy measurement cannot be done by simply thresholding the raw profiles. As a result, Manifold methods were proposed to recover true aCGH data from noisy measurements.

Traditional methods for identifying CNVs include hidden Markov models [2,3], break point detection [4,5], wavelet transform [6,7], and variational models [8]. These methods process each aCGH profile for individuals separately. Recently, the simultaneous analysis of whole aCGH profiles has drawn considerable attention.

It is well-known that aCGH profiles are corrupted with high level of noise and it is desired to recover the true signal from the observation data. The first model that is exploited is

(1) and the assumptions that the true aCGH profiles are sparse and piecewise continuous, the following minimization for recovering aCGH data is proposed [9]

                        1 and total variation norms, respectively. It is obvious that this method processes each sample separately, but it must be mentioned that it can be easily converted to analyze multisample profiles simultaneously. Another work based on model (1) can be found in [10]. Instead of finding a sparse model of each sample individually, it is supposed that the noise-free aCGH profiles in a data set are linearly correlated so that they can be recovered by finding the low rank approximation of the whole matrix [10]

                         are regularization parameters. One of the drawbacks of Eq. (6) is that it is non-convex over joint U and V, but it is convex over U and V separately. After solving Eq. (6), the true aCGH profiles will be recovered by multiplying U and V.

The underlying assumption of all aforementioned methods is that the noise by which aCGH profiles are contaminated is Gaussian. However, this assumption is not valid in all situations and real-world applications.

First, we propose a framework based on model (1) for recovering multisample profiles which is robust to various types of noise and predicated on piecewise continuity, sparsity and low rank of the true aCGH signals. The general robust framework for aCGH data recovery is

Second, to increase the speed of convergence, accelerated proximal gradient (APG) [13] is utilized. It will be shown that by utilizing APG, the multiplicative form of the HQ can be restated as the additive form. Finally, different loss functions

Before going any further, we review the half-quadratic theory upon which our framework will be proposed. HQ is predicated on conjugate function theory [14,15] for the convex and non-convex optimization. For a more thorough review, readers are referred to [16,17].

In [16], it is shown that when the additive form is applied, the number of iterations for convergence is greater than the number of iterations of the multiplicative form. In each iteration, however, the additive form has lower computational cost. Overall, optimization by the additive form takes less time than the multiplicative form in real applications [16]. The additive form has drawn less attention despite the fact that it is more economical in computation. In the next section, we give an efficient solution to the minimization (7) with both additive and multiplicative forms for

To speed up the convergence of any (smooth and non-smooth) convex programming, the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method was proposed based on the first order approximation [13,19]. According to the APG method, for an arbitrary differentiable convex function f(x) with Lipschitz continuous gradient,

                         similar to [12]. We fixed the possible values for α as 
                           {
                           0.1

                           }
                         and then found the value for λ
                        0 in 
                           [

                           ]
                         which has the minimum value for prediction error Eq. (28). After choosing λ
                        0 and α, the parameters λ
                        1 and λ
                        2 can be obtained.

In this section, we focus on the possible loss functions of 
                           ϕ
                           (
                           .
                           )
                        . In robust statistics, a robust technique is M-estimation [24]. Table 1 tabulates different M-estimation loss functions and their corresponding minimizer functions 
                           δ
                           (
                           .
                           )
                         for the additive form of 
                           ϕ
                           (
                           .
                           )
                        . As we utilized the APG method in Eq. (21), it is readily seen that the minimizer function to find E must be additive, whether we use the additive or multiplicative form for 
                           Q
                           (
                           .,.
                           )
                        . But, G
                        
                           E
                         in Eq. (21) has different values for the additive and multiplicative forms.

In information theoretic learning (ITL), the robustness of Correntropy [25–27] and Renyi׳s quadratic entropy [28] is scrutinized by their relation with the Welsch M-estimator. The probabilistic meaning of Correntropy is that it maximizes the error probability density at the origin [25]. This property guarantees the theoretical support that Correntropy can deal with large corruption.

Huber M-estimation is another possible function for 
                           ϕ
                           (
                           .
                           )
                         which its affinity with sparse representation is explored in [29]. Let us choose Huber loss function for 
                           ϕ
                           (
                           .
                           )
                         in Eq. (7) and 
                           F
                           (

                        [29], hence Eq. (29) is equivalent to RPLA Eq. (4). Therefore, RPLA is a special case of the proposed framework Eq. (7).

It is justified that RPLA is more robust in comparison to other algorithms because it minimizes Huber loss function rather than square error. Correntropy (Welsch M-estimator), on the other hand, has shown better performance in dealing with large corruptions [30,29]. Our experimental results support that the proposed framework with Correntropy loss function has better performance.

In this section, the proposed methods are compared with RPLA [11], TVSP [10] and GFLseg [31]. The Matlab code of all methods are available from the Mat-aCGH toolbox [32]. In Algorithm 1, it is possible to choose either the additive or multiplicative form for function 
                        Q
                        (

                        )
                     . The additive form is chosen because it converges in less time than the multiplicative form [16]. Moreover, the proposed algorithms benefit from the fast convergence of APG so that it has less complexity in each iteration and fast convergence at the same time. For the sake of simplicity, we call the method LRHQ

In this subsection, the performance of the proposed framework is compared with other aforementioned algorithms on simulated data. To do so, we generate 50 samples with the length of 500 probes and an arbitrary noise is added to the profiles. Two types of aberrations are considered. The first type is added to each individual sample at a random location independently and the second type is shared aberrations that are presented at the same location of multiple samples. The ratio between shared aberrations and total aberrations is called share percentage 
                        [10]. The length of each segment is selected from 
                           {
                           5
                           ,
                           15
                           ,
                           30
                           ,
                           40
                           ,
                           50
                           }
                        . To better evaluate various methods on diverse noise, five non-Gaussian noises are added to the simulated data. For each distribution, five random noises are generated which their parameters are randomly selected according to setting in Table 2
                        .

The average of ROC curve for four non-Guassian noise with diverse distributions is plotted in Fig. 1
                        . In this figure, for each of these distributions the average of ROC over five randomly generated profiles with noise is reported. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at different threshold setting. TPR and FPR for a threshold T are defined as

                         are number real aberrations and real normal, respectively. As we aim to plot ROC on synthesized data, the real and estimated data are available, therefore, the above-mentioned parameters in TPR and FPR for a threshold T can be easily obtained.

In each case, noise with different SNRs, shared percentages and settings is added and the performance of aforementioned algorithms are compared. As ROC curve deviating from diagonal line, it indicates better performance. From Fig. 1, it can be easily seen that the proposed algorithms outperform other methods in almost all cases and it can be concluded that other methods are not robust when the data are highly corrupted with non-Gaussian noise.

Further, the above methods are compared from the accuracy point of view. The accuracy (ACC) for a threshold T is defined as

                         and O(nm), respectively. Because the number of probes is much greater than the number of samples, we apply the proposed framework on simulated data with fixed number of samples and different number of probes. In each case, each method is performed twice and the standard deviation is reported. Fig. 5
                         plots the CPU time against number of probes for different methods. It can be readily seen that the computational time of the proposed methods increase linearly over the number of probes.

This paper presented a robust framework for multisample aCGH data analysis. The proposed framework accommodated the sparsity, low rank and piecewise constancy assumptions of true aCGH signals and tried to recover them accordingly. The proposed problem is not convex, but its efficient solution could be obtained by half quadratic programming and its convergence to a local optimum was guaranteed. In comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed framework demonstrated excellent robustness, especially when data are corrupted with large, non-Gaussian noise.

However, the proposed problem is not smooth and therefore, it oscillates around the optimal solution and converges slowly toward it. To overcome this issue, one can use the

                      loss function in Table 1 for F(B) which is smooth and converges faster. Further, the total variation of the whole aCGH profile can be utilized instead of the total variation of each individual sample. These modifications can increase the speed of convergence and the robustness of the algorithm.
