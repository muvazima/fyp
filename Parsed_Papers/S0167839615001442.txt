@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Pythagorean-hodograph (or shortly PH) curves form a special subclass of parametric curves. They are characterized by the property that their unit vector field of tangents is rational. Polynomial PH curves thus have a (piecewise) polynomial arc length, planar PH curves possess rational offset curves and spatial PH curves are equipped with rational orthonormal frames. This makes PH curves very useful for many practical applications in CAGD, CAD/CAM systems, CNC machining, robotics, animations, etc. Polynomial PH curves were first introduced in Farouki and Sakkalis (1990) and since then many approximation and interpolation schemes that involve these curves have been developed (see Farouki, 2008 and the references therein). On the other hand, not much work has been done on rational PH curves, since the extension from the polynomial ones is not straightforward. Planar rational PH curves were derived in Pottmann (1995a), Pottmann (1994), and independently in Fiorot and Gensane (1994). Some interpolation schemes involving these curves can be found in Pottmann (1995b).

The first step to spatial rational PH curves is carried out as a short note in Pottmann (1994) based on the dual representation of rational curves. More extensive study can be found in Farouki and Šír (2011), where the construction of spatial rational PH curves is presented and illustrated from a geometric point of view. The spatial rational PH curve is determined by prescribing a rational unit vector field of binormals obtained from a rational unit field of tangents, and a rational function that prescribes the signed distance of the osculating plane from the origin. Rational unit tangents can be constructed using stereographic projection or Euler–Rodrigues frame (ERF) associated with a quaternion polynomial. In Kozak et al. (2014) it is shown, based on the dual approach and ERF, that such a construction leads in general to curves of relatively high degrees. More precisely, the connection between degrees of quaternion polynomials, dual representation and rational PH curves is revealed, and the question how to obtain low degree curves is considered in detail. Based on quadratic quaternion polynomials rational PH curves with the dual representation of degree

                      degrees of freedom are constructed. In particular, cubic rational PH curves with nonconstant denominator depending on ten free parameters are presented in a closed form. Since a family of cubic polynomial PH curves is also ten parametric, rationals do not provide additional degrees of freedom. Moreover both rational and polynomial spatial PH curves have rational canal surfaces (as an equivalent to offset curves in the planar case) and it is also true, that rational PH curves (in contrast to the polynomial ones) do not have rational arc length in general, which might be needed in some motion control applications. However, as shown in this paper, cubic rational PH curves are superior in other aspects to the polynomial ones when used for

                      interpolation of two data points and two tangent directions at these two points by spatial cubic PH curves is important for practical applications and has therefore been considered for polynomial curves in quite a few papers (e.g. 
                     Wagner and Ravani, 1997; Jüttler and Mäurer, 1999; Pelosi et al., 2005; Kwon, 2010; Jaklič et al., 2012). Since the problem is nonlinear, the analysis of the existence and the number of interpolants according to different

                      data is quite a difficult task. The conditions that provide the existence of cubic polynomial PH interpolants for many but not all possible data configurations can be found in Wagner and Ravani (1997), Jüttler and Mäurer (1999), Pelosi et al. (2005). A complete characterization of the existence conditions for all possible

                      data has later been established in Kwon (2010), and further in Jaklič et al. (2012), where nice geometrically intuitive necessary and sufficient conditions on the data have been derived.

Unfortunately, the range of data configurations for which 
                        
                           
                              G

                      cubic polynomial PH interpolants do not exist is quite large (see Fig. 1
                     ), which is a disadvantage if we want to make a scheme practically useful. In this paper we show that

                      cubic rational PH interpolants exist for all possible true spatial

                      data. They are determined by nonlinear equations derived by combining a closed form curve representation given in Kozak et al. (2014), and the Gram matrix approach (used also in Jaklič et al., 2012). The existence of the solution is proven by using a homotopy analysis. It is shown that the number of rational interpolants with nonconstant denominator is always odd, and that rational interpolants are separated from the polynomial ones for all possible spatial data. But, as discussed further, if the data are planar, cubic rational PH curves provide the interpolant only in very particular setup. Numerical procedures to compute the solution are proposed too, together with some examples that confirm the theoretical results.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section the interpolation problem and the main result are presented. Section 3 recalls the quaternion approach from Kozak et al. (2014) and derives some basic properties of interpolants. In Section 4 the Gram matrix approach is presented and in Section 5 the basic PH equations are derived. Homotopy analysis is used in the next section to confirm the existence of a solution for true spatial data. Technically demanding, but tedious proofs needed in the section 6 are left to Kozak (2014). In Section 7 the algebraic approach and the planar case are briefly considered. Section 8 discusses the numerical solution of the PH equations. An algorithm is proposed in which one has to find real roots of a couple of single variable degree 6 polynomials only. Numerical examples of the last section conclude the main part of the paper.

Here and throughout the paper the term true space problem denotes the case when problem can't be reduced to a planar one. Similarly, true rational curve refers a rational curve that is not polynomial too.

In Kozak et al. (2014) the general spatial cubic rational PH curve closed form was derived. The approach that led to it is based upon Euler–Rodrigues frame obtained from a quadratic quaternion polynomial. The closed form depends on ten free parameters: four of them come from the quadratic quaternion polynomial coefficients, three are hidden in the rotation matrix 
                        R
                     , and the last three determine the point on the curve at a particular parameter value. Let us recall the main theorem (Kozak et al., 2014, Theorem 7) in short. Suppose that the parameters

                      Here, 
                        R
                      denotes a rotation matrix that depends on three free parameters. The rotation matrix 
                        R
                      admits several standard representations. As an example, it could be expressed as a product of rotations around the Cartesian coordinate axes depending on the Euler angles.

Though the curve given by (7) is in the closed form, we have found it quite unsuitable to cope with the 
                        
                           
                              G

                      interpolation problem (1). Only interpolating one point it is straightforward since it is achieved by the curve translation. All the other equations that follow from (1) and (7) turn out highly nonlinear, and can't be significantly simplified. Even for the numerical data, finding the solution was quite a task. So we switched to the Gram matrix approach introduced in Jaklič et al. (2012), where the solution looked for should preserve particular properties of the closed form (7). This simplifies to amenable extent the approach followed in the paper. First of all, observe that the denominator q is of degree ≤2 only. This is due to a particularly chosen parameterization of the curve that maps a singular curve point to infinity. The crucial observations are given as the following lemma. 
                        Lemma 1
                        
                           Let r be the curve defined in 
                           (5)

                           (6)
                           , and 
                           (7)
                           . Let 
                           (2) 
                           and 
                           (3) 
                           hold. The curve denominator q is positive on

                        r
                      is to use the Lagrange basis that corresponds to the data

                      Unfortunately, if expanded these four equations would require several pages of the paper, and we have found them to hard to analyze. So, additionally, we require that the interpolating curve satisfies the PH conditions in the stronger form derived in Kozak et al. (2014). By Lemma 1 the PH conditions then read

This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1. It is split in Lemma 3, Lemma 4, and Lemma 5. The proofs of the lemmas are quite technical and tedious. As strongly suggested, we moved them to Kozak (2014). The reader that is interested in the applications part of the paper mainly can skip them entirely. The equations (28) depend on three parameters

                      a homotopy path. The homotopy argument that counts the number of solutions is very simple: if no rational solution along s approaches 
                        ∂
                        D
                     , the total number of rational solutions along the homotopy path s could change only by an even number. Since the number of solutions is odd at the particular data set of Lemma 3, it must be odd at the general one too. It remains now to prove that a rational solution can't near

                      Thus by Remark 2 the weights satisfy

One is clearly tempted to study the properties of the system (28) for general cosines

                      and the data point distance

                      by the entirely algebraic approach directly. But as expected the straightforward Gröbner basis computation fails in this symbolic setup. Nevertheless, it works for the data prescribed, what gives a numerical approach as one of the computational procedures described in the next section.

However, stubborn as we are, we have not given up the symbolic algebraic approach entirely, and the interplay of human and computer elimination steps that took quite a while resulted in the first Gröbner basis polynomial. Suppose that the Gröbner basis of 
                        e

The following observation covers a particular data case that will be used in the next section.

The assertion of Theorem 2 was based on the equations derived with the help of Lemma 1. However, the numerical evidence on Fig. 2
                      was computed for the general equations (18), without simplifications inherited from the quaternion approach. The results obtained show no difference among general and simplified version of equations. This gives a strong computational support to the following conjecture. 
                        Conjecture 1
                        
                           The only planar true rational cubic PH curves are rationally parameterized circles arcs.
                        

It is possible to accompany 
                        
                           
                              q

                      with the rest of the symbolic Gröbner basis but this would make (Kozak, 2014) unbearably long, and other ways to the numerical solution have to be worked out. Note that the polynomial case is covered in Jaklič et al. (2012) completely. So we consider the true space problem, and the extended equations set (36) only. Let 
                        I
                      denote the ideal spanned by (36), and 
                        V
                      be the corresponding variety. If a polynomial equations solver is available, it is a straightforward but perhaps not most efficient to find all the solutions of the system (36). The admissible solutions 
                        V
                      are then selected from the whole polynomial equations solution set.

As an alternative, we provide an algorithm that depends on the computation of real roots of a couple of single variable polynomials of degree ≤6 only. A numerical test carried out in Kozak (2014) suggests that near three such root-finding problems are to be expected. Quite a gain in efficiency compared with the straightforward approach. The basic idea of the procedure is to examine the ideal 
                        I
                      along a binary tree (Fig. 3
                     ) that depends mainly on the coefficients

                     , and none for the others. The unique rational solutions exist for all the data rows. Similarly, there is a single polynomial solution for the first data triple of the second example, and two for the second one. As expected, rational solutions are obtained for all the data rows (Fig. 5
                     ).

The last example shows that the solution path may suffer unexpected kinks extremely close to the boundary
