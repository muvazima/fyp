                  Epilepsy is a critical neurological disorder resulting from abnormal hyper-excitability of neurons in the brain. Studies have shown that epilepsy can be detected in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of patients suffering from seizures. The performance of EEG-based epileptic seizure detection relies largely on how well one can extract features from an EEG that characterize seizure activity. Conventional feature extraction methods using time-series analysis, spectral analysis and nonlinear dynamic analysis have advanced in recent years to improve detection. The computational complexity has also increased to obtain a higher detection rate. This study aimed to develop an efficient feature extraction method based on Hjorth׳s mobility to reduce computational complexity while maintaining high detection accuracy. A new feature extraction method was proposed by computing the spectral power of Hjorth׳s mobility components, which were effectively estimated by differentiating EEG signals in real-time. Using EEG data in five epileptic patients, this method resulted in a detection rate of 99.46% between interictal and epileptic EEG signals and 99.78% between normal and epileptic EEG signals, which is comparable to most advanced nonlinear methods. These results suggest that the spectral features of Hjorth׳s mobility components in EEG signals can represent seizure activity and may pave the way for developing a fast and reliable epileptic seizure detection method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The symptoms of epilepsy are characterized by recurrent and unpredictable seizures, called epileptic seizures, resulting from excessive neuronal activity in the brain [1]. Epileptic seizures negatively affect physical and psychological behavior, resulting in significant social maladaptation and even death [1,2]. The etiology of epilepsy is known to include lesions in the brain and genetic abnormalities, leading to impaired neuronal regulation; however, epilepsy can also be caused by unknown factors that are difficult to identify [1]. The prognosis and diagnosis of epilepsy are highly dependent on the interpretation of neuronal activity in the brain. Consequently, the detection of epileptic signs embedded in neural activity is of great importance.

Due to its simplicity and efficiency, electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used in epilepsy research [3]. EEG signals during seizures show distinct patterns that reflect excessive neuronal activity; hence, epilepsy can be diagnosed by monitoring epileptic characteristics by EEG. However, this monitoring process is often time consuming, burdensome, and dependent on visual inspection [4]. To overcome these limitations, various computational models have been developed for automated epileptic seizure detection. A number of studies have proposed computational models to extract epileptic EEG features using time-series analysis with correlation [5], autoregressive (AR) model parameters [6], and Hjorth׳s parameters [7], or the use of frequency analysis with the Fourier transform [8] and wavelet transform [9]. More complicated features have also been extracted using nonlinear dynamics properties, including correlation dimension [10], wavelet entropy [11], approximate entropy, and Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy [12]. Once specific features are determined, a classifier is built and used to detect epileptic EEG patterns. Many epilepsy classifiers have been designed using machine learning models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs). To date, a variety of ANNs and other machine learning methods have been developed for seizure detection, including probabilistic neural network (PNN) [13], multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) [14], spiking neural network (SNN) [15], recurrent Elman network (REN) [11], and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) [16].

Efforts to improve epileptic seizure detection by identifying more reliable features and employing further advanced machine learning algorithms have demonstrated quite accurate detection results. Despite their successful results, these approaches can suffer from great computational complexity, particularly when nonlinear features/models are used. The models using nonlinear features and/or nonlinear classifiers require multiple processing steps and complex computational procedures, rendering them inappropriate for real-time diagnoses. To reduce the computational burden while maintaining accuracy, this study sought a new approach for epileptic seizure detection. The goal is to maximize computational simplicity without sacrificing detection accuracy compared to current nonlinear models.

Toward that end, features were created using one of Hjorth׳s parameters, mobility [7], which has been widely used in time-series analyses of electroencephalograms. Mobility was estimated by time-domain differentiation and was then transformed to the frequency-domain using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Once a spectral mobility feature space was created, a classifier based on Fisher discriminant (FD) analysis or MLPNN was built to detect seizure activity. Using the same dataset, the detection performance of the new method was compared to those of previous nonlinear methods to determine whether it could provide state-of-the-art detection accuracy.

Epileptic and normal EEG signals analyzed in this study were obtained from the publicly available EEG database created by Andrzejak et al. [17], which contains five subsets denoted as Sets A, B, C, D, and E. Set A was extracranially recorded from five healthy subjects who did not show any epileptic symptoms. Set B was also extracranially recorded from five healthy subjects, but it contained eye blinking artifacts. Sets C and D were intracranially recorded from five epileptic patients during interictal periods. Set C was recorded from the hippocampal formation on the opposite side of the epileptogenic zone, and Set D was recorded from the epileptogenic zone. Set E was intracranially recorded from all of the recording zones in Sets C and D during ictal periods. Among these five sets, only Set E contained seizure activities. All of the EEG signals were recorded using a 128-channel amplifier system with a sampling rate of 173.61Hz. Signals were filtered with a 0.53–40Hz bandpass, and artifacts resulting from muscle and eye movements were removed by visual inspection. Each set consisted of 100 single-channel segments, each of which spanned 23.6s. In this study, Sets A and D were selected as a normal set and an interictal set, respectively. Set E was selected as an epileptic set and compared to Sets A and D. While the primary focus was on analyzing Sets A, D, and E, Sets B and C were also analyzed for the purpose of confirming that the method could be applied to data with diverse characteristics.

The approach to epileptic feature extraction was based on two basic signal processing schemes: mobility and Fourier transform. Mobility is one of Hjorth׳s parameters used for time-series analysis [7]. Activity, the first Hjorth׳s parameters, is defined as the variance of the EEG amplitudes in a given time frame. Mobility, the second Hjorth׳s parameters, is defined as the square root of the ratio of activity of the first derivative of the EEG amplitudes to activity of the EEG amplitudes in a given time frame

                           σ
                         denotes the standard deviation of the EEG amplitudes and 
                           σ
                           ′
                         denotes the standard deviation of the first derivative of the EEG amplitudes. The characteristic of mobility is highly dependent on the first derivative, which indicates the instantaneous slopes of EEG signals. This study modified mobility such that the first order time-domain differentiation was applied to the EEG signals, but no further computation (i.e., the standard deviation) was performed. Instead, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) was performed to generate time-varying spectral features of the differentiated EEG signals. In the STFT analysis, the parameters of the sliding window were optimized, including the window size and the step size. Window sizes of 0.737, 1.475, 2.949, and 5.898s were sampled, along with step sizes of 0.092, 0.184, 0.369, and 0.737s. As each EEG segment contained 4096 discrete samples lasting 23.6s, the parameters could be translated into seconds as follows: 128, 256, 512, and 1024 samples for the window size corresponding to 0.737- to 5.898-s windows and 16, 32, 64, and 128 samples for the step size corresponding to 0.092- to 0.737-s step sizes. After applying the STFT analysis to both the original and differentiated EEG signals, we extracted the averaged powers ranging from 2 to 55Hz with 2-Hz frequency resolution. For each frequency-bin, we calculated the ratio of the averaged power of differentiated signals to that of the original signals. Those calculated ratios of all frequency-bins were constructed as a feature vector into classifiers.

The goal of classification was to discriminate the epileptic EEG signals from non-epileptic signals. Among the many classifiers that can be used for this purpose, a FD-based classifier was chosen because of its computational simplicity. The classifier used in this study was built based on quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) (see [18] for details).

QDA discriminates two or more classes using a decision boundary estimated from the data with quadratic functions. QDA is more general than the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method because QDA does not require that each class has the same covariance as in the case of LDA. Due to this computational advantage, QDA generally provides a better classification outcome than LDA [19]. In QDA, the spectral feature vector,

                        , was projected into the subspace spanned by

                        , maximizing between-class scattering while minimizing within-class scattering:

Classification accuracy was evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation. Data was divided into 10 equal-size subsets. One of these subsets was used as a test set and the remaining nine subsets were used to train the QDA classifier. The training and testing operations were iterated 10 times. In each iteration step, accuracy was measured as a ratio of the number of correctly classified short-time subsets to the total number of subsets. In addition, sensitivity measured how well a classifier discriminated the target class (e.g., epileptic class) whereas specificity measured how well a classifier discriminated the control class (e.g., normal class). Specificity and sensitivity were defined by

The epileptic seizure detection procedure consisted of time-domain differentiation, FFT-based frequency-domain spectral analysis, QDA-based classification, and epilepsy detection. To investigate whether time-domain differentiation was independent of subsequent analysis methods, another procedure was designed by replacing FFT-based spectral analysis with an AR model and a QDA classifier with MLPNN. The Yule–Walker method was used for the AR parameter estimation with the least mean squares criterion. Thirty was chosen as an optimal order for the AR model according to a previous study [6]. A three-layer feed-forward MLPNN trained by a back-propagation algorithm was used to classify between normal/interictal and epileptic EEG signals.

This study first researched how time differentiation changed the frequency profile of the non-epileptic and epileptic EEG signals. Epileptic EEG signals are generally characterized by sharp periodic waves (
                        Fig. 1a). When the epileptic EEG signals were differentiated, the spike-like periodic patterns became more apparent (Fig. 1b). Conversely, time differentiation of the non-epileptic EEG signals did not generate spiking patterns or periodic waves. The enhanced difference between the epileptic and non-epileptic signals created by time differentiation was directly transformed to the frequency-domain by Fourier transform. The spectral density of the epileptic EEG signals upon differentiation provided additional features. For instance, the spectral power of both original and time-differentiated EEG signals clearly revealed a specific pattern in a band of approximately 30Hz in the epileptic signals (Set E), which did not appear in interictal (Set D) or normal signals (Set A) (Fig. 1d).

We evaluated the seizure detection performance with every possible combination of these two parameters to find an optimal parameter set that produced the best performance. Both classification accuracies for Sets D and E and for Sets A and B increased with larger window sizes and smaller step sizes. The highest classification accuracy was achieved with a window size of 5.898s and a step size of 0.092s (see 
                        Table 1). With these optimal parameters, classification accuracy reached 99.46% between Sets D and E, and 99.78% between Sets A and E. 
                        Table 2 shows the confusion matrices for classification between Sets A and E and Sets D and E, with and without time-domain differentiation. TN, FP, TP, and FN in each matrix resulted from 10-fold cross-validation with a window size of 5.898s and a step size of 0.092s. Between Sets D and E, time-domain differentiation increased sensitivity, which indicated an improved epilepsy detection rate by 0.46% (from 99.14% to 99.60%) and improved specificity, which indicated a reduced rate of false positive by 2.12% (from 97.19% to 99.31%). These results showed that time-domain differentiation was especially effective at reducing the false positive rate to below 1%. Between Sets A and E, time-domain differentiation increased sensitivity and specificity from 99.51% to 99.71% and from 99.53 to 99.84%, respectively. These improvements were smaller than those between Sets D and E. The Wilcoxon rank sum test revealed that both sensitivity (p<0.001) and specificity (p<0.001) were significantly increased by time differentiation between Sets D and E. Similarly, sensitivity (p=0.04) and specificity (p=0.0022) were significantly increased between Sets A and E by time-domain differentiation. The confusion matrix summarizes these classification performance measures (see Table 2).

The approach of using Hjorth׳s mobility feature extraction was extended to various data and detection algorithms. Epileptic (Set E) EEGs were discriminated against normal (Sets A or B), as well as interictal (Sets C and D) EEGs. Two detection methods were applied, FFT-QDA and AR-MLPNN, for discrimination of epileptic EEGs with the same window size (5.898s) and step size (0.092s). It was observed from 10-fold cross-validation analyses that average classification accuracy increased by time-domain differentiation using both FFT-QDA and AR-MLPNN (see 
                        Table 3). The results showed that classification accuracy between Sets D and E increased from 94.47% to 97.97% in AR-MLPNN, and from 98.15% to 99.47% in FFT-QDA by time-domain differentiation. Moreover, FFT-QDA outperformed AR-MLPNN to discriminate Set E from Set D with or without time-domain differentiation. For the other data sets, two algorithms yielded similar accuracy.

The differences between two algorithms were examined in more detail by generating the confusion matrices between Set A and Set E, Set B and Set E, Set C and Set E, and Set D and Set E. TN, FP, TP, and FN in each matrix were calculated and averaged using 10-fold cross-validation. Between Sets D and E, time-domain differentiation increased sensitivity, which indicated an improved epilepsy detection rate by 1.38% (from 96.01% to 97.39%) in AR-MLPNN and by 0.45% (from 99.15% to 99.60%) in FFT-QDA, respectively. Time-domain differentiation also improved specificity in Sets D and E, with a reduced rate of false positives by 5.61% (from 92.93% to 98.54%) in AR-MLPNN and by 2.18% (from 97.15% to 99.33%) in FFT-QDA, respectively. These results showed that time-domain differentiation was effective at reducing the false positive rate in both AR-MLPNN and FFT-QDA.

By leveraging Hjorth׳s mobility, we developed an efficient algorithm for the detection of epileptic seizure with computational simplicity and high accuracy rate comparable to other more complex algorithms. However, this study still has several limitations. First, the dataset used in the study consisted of a small sample size (n=5) in each EEG dataset. It would be necessary for the proposed algorithm to be tested by other epileptic EEG datasets to increase the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. Second, the quantitative comparisons should be made with other algorithms in combination with adjustable parameters for classifier and specification of dataset. From the perspective of algorithm efficiency, it is important to exactly quantify the loss and gain by means of computational complexity and accuracy rate. Finally, due to the limit of the EEG segment length and intrinsic EEG temporal resolution, there should be upper/lower boundaries of the optimal window size and step size. In the present study, we showed how we explored the window size and step size for classification, without focusing much on finding the optimal size as precisely as possible. It will be interesting to explore this point further, though, to determine the effect of signal processing parameters on the seizure detection in a future study.

Future work will include the simulation of our method using other EEG data sets and the implementation of an on-line epilepsy diagnosis system based on our method for the translation into clinical applications. We also envision that further development of our methods to analyze the pre-seizure and post-seizure EEG activity may provide a means to predict seizure activity, which will be critical in many clinical applications.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A novel method to detect epileptic seizure activity from intracranial EEG recordings was proposed. In this method, signal features were extracted using time-domain differentiation (based on Hjorth׳s mobility) and fast Fourier transform, and these features were classified using a linear classifier. Epileptic seizure detection using this method resulted in 99.46% accuracy between intracranial interictal and intracranial epileptic signals, and 99.78% accuracy between scalp normal and intracranial epileptic signals. It was shown that time-domain differentiation significantly increased classification accuracy between intracranial interictal and epileptic signals. In particular, specificity was more markedly increased than was sensitivity, indicating that this method effectively decreased the false positive rate (i.e., healthy subjects incorrectly diagnosed as epileptic). By optimizing the window and step sizes, it was found that higher classification accuracy was obtained with larger window sizes and smaller step sizes. Also, it was discovered that time-domain differentiation successfully enhanced classification accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity in another well-known approach based on AR-MLPNN. This may imply that time-domain differentiation can be a useful tool in detecting epileptic signatures in EEG signals. In this study, only one of Hjorth׳s parameters, mobility, was used for epileptic feature extraction.
