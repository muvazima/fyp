                  In this paper, we investigate the reduction in total transmission time and the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks using multi-hop data aggregation by forming coordination in hierarchical clustering. Novel algorithm handles wireless sensor network in numerous circumstances as in large extent and high density deployments. One of the major purposes is to collect information from inaccessible areas by using factorization of the area into subareas (clusters) and appointing cluster head in each of the subarea. Coordination and cooperation among the local nodes via relay nodes in local cluster (By forming sub clusters) helped to serve each and every node. Routing is based on the predefined path, proposed by new transmission algorithm. Transmission distance is minimized by using cluster coordinators for inter cluster communication and relay nodes within the cluster. We show by extended simulations that Chain Based Cluster Cooperative Protocol (CBCCP) performs very well in terms of energy and time. To prove it, we compare it with LEACH, SEP, genetic HCR and ERP and found that new protocol consumes six times less energy than LEACH, five times less energy than SEP, four time less energy than genetic HCR and three times less energy than ERP, which further validate our work.
