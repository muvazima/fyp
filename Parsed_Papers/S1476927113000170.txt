                  In 1996, a trinucleotide circular code X is identified in genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Arquès and Michel, 1996). In 2012, X motifs are identified in the transfer RNA (tRNA) Phe and 16S ribosomal RNA (Michel, 2012). A statistical analysis of X motifs in all available tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in the genomic tRNA database (September 2012, http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb/, Lowe and Eddy, 1997) is carried out here. For this purpose, a search algorithm of X motifs in a DNA sequence is developed. Two definitions allow to determine the occurrence probabilities of X motifs and the circular codes X,

This approach identifies X motifs in the 5′ and/or 3′ regions of 16 isoaccepting tRNAs (except for the tRNAs Arg, His, Ser and Trp). The statistical analyses are performed on different and large tRNA populations according to the taxonomy (prokaryotes and eukaryotes), tRNA length and tRNA score. Finally, a circular code property observed in genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is identified in the 3′ regions of 19 isoaccepting tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (except for the tRNA Leu). The identification of X motifs and a gene circular code property in tRNAs strengthens the concept proposed in Michel (2012) of a possible translation (framing) code based on a circular code.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The structure and the function of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), molecules which are involved for translating the genetic information into proteins, are detailed, e.g., in a review of Zaher and Green (2009). The ability of all living organisms to efficiently and accurately translate genomic information into functional proteins is a fascinating molecular function. The ribosome must correctly associate, according to the genetic code, the amino-acid attached to the tRNA with the trinucleotide in reading frame (codon) of messenger RNA (mRNA). It must decode only successive codons and not trinucleotides in shifted frames. However, an mRNA lacks punctuation (or comma) which could be used by the transfer and ribosomal RNAs to identify the trinucleotides in reading frame. There are multiple genetic codes, moreover, multiple translational codes, while one of them is the well-known triplet genetic code, and another one could be a circular code.

The maintenance of the correct reading frame in genes is believed to be a complex process from a conceptual point of view. I say the opposite from a theoretical point of view. Indeed, there are sets of trinucleotides called circular codes Y which are framing codes, i.e. with the property of reading frame retrieval, synchronization and maintenance. Furthermore, there are trinucleotide circular codes Y which have in addition the 
                        
                           C
                        
                      self-complementary property, i.e. the trinucleotides of Y are complementary to each other, i.e. 
                        
                           Y
                           =
                           
                              C
                           
                           (
                           Y
                           )
                        
                     . Finally, there are self-complementary trinucleotide circular codes Y which have in addition the C
                     3 property, i.e. the permuted trinucleotide sets

                      of Y by one and two nucleotides, respectively, are also trinucleotide circular codes and complementary to each other, i.e.

However, the search for a framing code was a very difficult task. Over 50 years ago, before the discovery of the genetic code, a class of trinucleotide circular codes, called comma-free codes (or codes without commas), was proposed by Crick et al. (1957). However, no trinucleotide comma-free code was identified in genes, theoretically or statistically. The main reason that I propose to explain the successive failures for many years, is related to the fact that almost all developed statistical analyses during several years to understand the genetic code, were based on the reading frame (frame 0). For example, the codon usage, a classical method based on the frequencies of codons (i.e. trinucleotides in frame 0), which is widely used by biostatisticians, bioinformaticians and biologists, can (only) explain the variations of the genetic code, e.g. the differences between the codons coding the same amino acid, the codon differences between species, etc. But it cannot explain the “origin” of the genetic code. The genetic code is associated to the reading frame “space”. To understand the origin of the genetic code, a more general space should be considered, e.g. the three frames of genes. The difficulty of methods for identifying such codes is not concerned, only the choice of the space. By convention here, the reading frame established by a start codon {ATG, GTG, TTG} is the frame 0, and the frames 1 and 2 are the reading frame 0 shifted by one and two nucleotides in the 5′–3′ direction, respectively.

In 1996, a statistical analysis of occurrence frequencies of the 64 trinucleotides

                           =
                           {
                           AAA
                           ,
                           …

                      in the three frames 0, 1 and 2 of genes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes showed that the trinucleotides are not uniformly distributed in these three frames. By excluding the four trinucleotides with identical nucleotides {AAA, CCC, GGG, TTT} and by assigning each trinucleotide to a preferential frame (frame of its highest occurrence frequency), three subsets X, X
                     1 and X
                     2 of 20 trinucleotides are found in the frames 0, 1 and 2, respectively, simultaneously of two large gene populations (protein coding regions): eukaryotes (26,757 sequences, 11,397,678 trinucleotides) and prokaryotes (13,686 sequences, 4,709,758 trinucleotides) (Arquès and Michel, 1996). The set X contains the 20 following trinucleotides

The two sets X
                     1 and X
                     2, of 20 trinucleotides each, in the frames 1 and 2 of genes can be deduced from X by circular permutation (see below). These three trinucleotide sets present several strong mathematical properties, particularly the fact that they are trinucleotide circular codes (Arquès and Michel, 1996). We have also proved that a comma-free code, a code proposed by Crick et al. (1957), is a particular circular code. Precisely, a hierarchy of circular codes is closed by the strongest ones which are comma-free and the weakest ones which have a large “necklace” (Michel et al., 2008).

A circular code Y is a particular set of words which allows the retrieval of the construction (reading frame) of any word generated by Y. Furthermore, this reading frame retrieval can be obtained anywhere in any generated word by Y but with a window of a few letters (see below). Thus, the common trinucleotide circular code X (1) of 20 trinucleotides allows the reading frames in genes to be retrieved locally, i.e. anywhere in genes and in particular without start codon.

We briefly recall a few properties of the common trinucleotide circular code X (1) which are involved in this paper.

                            is also not a trinucleotide circular code.

A trinucleotide circular code allows the reading frame in genes to be retrieved. It is a set of words over an alphabet such that any word written on a circle (the next letter after the last letter of the word being the first letter) has a unique decomposition into words of the circular code.
                        Example 1
                        Let the set Y be composed of the six following words: Y
                           ={AAT, ATG, CCT, CTA, GCC, GGC} and the word w, be a series of the nine following letters: w
                           =ATGGCCCTA. The word w, written on a circle, can be factorized into words of Y according to two different ways: ATG, GCC, CTA and AAT, GGC, CCT, the commas showing the way of decomposition. Therefore, Y is not a circular code. In contrast, if the set Z obtained by replacing the word GGC of Y by GTC is considered, i.e. Z
                           ={AAT, ATG, CCT, CTA, GCC, GTC}, then there never exists an ambiguous word with Z, such as w for Y, and then Z is a circular code (Michel, 2012, Fig. 2 for details).


                           Window of a circular code: The construction frame (reading frame) of a word w generated by any concatenation of words of a circular code Y (shortly a word w of Y) can be retrieved anywhere in the word w after the reading of a certain number of letters. This series of letters is called the window of the circular code Y. Then, the window length to retrieve the construction frame of the word w is the letter length of the longest ambiguous word which can be read in at least two frames, plus one letter. The window length depends on the circular code Y. The classical window length defined for biinfinite words of a circular code Y is described in Michel (2012, 
                           Fig. 3 for details).

In order to analyze trinucleotide circular code motifs read in only one direction and to investigate the reading frame retrieval of their trinucleotides, in the same way as the trinucleotides (and nucleotides) are read only in one direction in DNA and RNA, i.e. the 5′–3′ direction, we have introduced a new concept based on a window length l for a right infinite word w
                     =
                     l
                     0
                     l
                     1
                     l
                     2
                     l
                     3
                     l
                     4 … of a trinucleotide circular code Y such that l
                     0
                     l
                     1
                     l
                     2
                     ∈
                     Y, i.e. w begins with a trinucleotide belonging to Y and ends with either a proper prefix of a trinucleotide of Y or with a trinucleotide of Y (Michel, 2012).
                        Property 1
                        
                           The window length l to retrieve the construction frame for any right infinite word of the common circular code X is the letter length of the longest ambiguous word plus one letter and is equal to l

In 2012, X motifs (motifs of the common trinucleotide circular code X) are identified in transfer and 16S ribosomal RNAs: an almost perfect tRNA–Phe X motif of 26 nucleotides including the anticodon stem-loop and seven 16S rRNA X motifs of length greater or equal to 15 nucleotides. A 3D visualization of X motifs in the ribosome (crystal structure 3I8G, Jenner et al., 2010) shows several spatial configurations involving mRNA X motifs, A-tRNA and E-tRNA X motifs, and four 16S rRNA X motifs. Another identified 16S rRNA X motif is involved in the decoding center which recognizes the codon-anticodon helix in A-tRNA.

From a code theory point of view, these identified X motifs and their mathematical properties may constitute a framing code. The aim of this paper is to identify X motifs in transfer RNAs in order to strengthen the concept of a translation code based on a circular code, a concept recently proposed in Michel (2012).

The Section 2 presents a search algorithm of X motifs in a DNA sequence. Such an algorithm was never proposed since 1996. Two definitions allow to determine the occurrence probabilities of X motifs and the circular codes X, X
                     1 and X
                     2 in a population of tRNAs. The tRNA data are described and the populations of the 20 isoaccepting tRNAs based on their taxonomy (prokaryotes, eukaryotes), length and score which are analyzed statistically, are characterized. The Section 3 presents the distribution of X motifs in random tRNAs. Then, X motifs are identified in the 5′ and 3′ regions of tRNAs. These results are confirmed by several statistical analyses of different and large tRNA populations. Finally, a circular code property observed in genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is identified in the 3′ regions of 19 isoaccepting tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

@&#METHODS@&#

We propose here a search algorithm of X motifs in a DNA sequence. Even if its principle is simple, such an algorithm was never proposed since 1996. It will allow bioinformaticians to implement it in various biological contexts: search of X motifs in DNA databases, sequence alignment based on X motifs, etc. We will apply it here to the analysis of the statistical distribution of X motifs in the 20 isoaccepting tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

The description of the algorithm uses the following classical notions of language theory. Let x be a word (sequence) on A
                        4 of length |x|. x[i] denotes the letter at index i of x and x[i..j] denotes the factor of x defined by x[i]x[i

The Algorithm_Search_X_motif proposed here searches in a DNA sequence the X motif of greatest length having at least a given number of nucleotides. Its input parameters are the DNA sequence, named seq, and the minimum number of nucleotides of the X motif, named lgMinX. Its output parameter is either a list containing the X motif, its length and its start and end positions in the DNA sequence seq, or an empty list. It uses the function Xmotif which searches a X motif at a given position startX in seq (input parameter).
                           
                              
                           
                        
                        
                           
                              
                           
                        
                     

Instruction 4 of Algorithm_Search_Xmotif stores all the X motifs in listXMotif (a list) of lengths greater or equal to the constant lgMinX. Instruction 5 sorts the X motifs in listXMotif by descending order of their lengths (the length is the 2nd element in listXMotif) and ranges them in listSortXMotif (a different list in order to perform eventually additional treatment in listXMotif). Instruction 6 returns the X motif of greatest length having at least lgMinX nucleotides in the DNA sequence seq if listSortXMotif is not empty.

The X motif returned by the Algorithm_Search_Xmotif beginning at position b and ending at position e in a sequence s is defined for Section 2.2 by the set X[b,e,s] containing the following nucleotides

                        4 in a position i of a tRNA s of

                        . By convention, the position i
                        =0 in a tRNA refers to the anticodon (symbolized by the three nucleotides n
                        0
                        n

                        0, Fig. 1a). All tRNAs s of 
                           
                              F
                           
                         are centered according to their anticodon position i
                        =0. The statistical analysis of X motifs will exclude the anticodons whose nucleotides depend on the isoaccepting tRNAs. By convention, all nucleotides before the anticodon (5’ region) have a negative position i
                        <0 and all nucleotides after the anticodon (3’ region) have a positive position i
                        >0. It should be stressed that both regions are analyzed in the same direction, i.e. the 5’–3’ direction. As the tRNAs have different lengths, the occurrence probability of X motifs is defined for a nucleotide range [min(s), max(s)] varying for each tRNA s of 
                           
                              F
                           
                        , min(s) being the minimum position (negative value) and max(s), the maximum position. Thus, for each tRNA s, two regions are studied: the 5′ region in the nucleotide range [min(s), −1], i.e. max(s) has the particular value −1, and the 3′ region in the nucleotide range [1, max(s)], i.e. min(s) has the particular value 1. As some positions i may not exist with some nucleotide ranges, let

The tRNAs are extracted from the genomic tRNA database (September 2012, http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb/, Lowe and Eddy, 1997). Usual preliminary tests exclude tRNAs with nucleotides different from A
                        4 and with inconsistent lengths, anticodon positions and anticodon types. We recall that isoaccepting tRNAs code the same amino acid.

                            gives the histograms representing the numbers of isoaccepting tRNAs of prokaryotes PRO as a function of their lengths. Its distribution greater than 10% of data shows:
                              
                                 (i)
                                 eight tRNAs have two preferential lengths: Ala {76,73}, Arg {77,74}, Asn {76,75}, Asp {77,76}, Ile {77,74}, Lys {76,73}, Phe {76,73} and Pro {77,74} (the tRNA lengths in each list being given by descending order of their numbers);

ten tRNAs have three preferential lengths: Cys {74,71,75}, Gln {75,72,74}, Glu {76,75,72}, Gly {76,74,75}, His {76,77,73}, Leu {87,85,86}, Met {77,74,76}, Ser {90,91,88}, Thr {76,73,75} and Tyr {85,86,84};

two tRNAs have four preferential lengths: Trp {76,73,74,77} and Val {76,75,77,73}.

Thus, the preferential lengths of the 20 isoaccepting tRNAs of prokaryotes are:
                              
                                 (i)
                                 76 nucleotides for 10 tRNAs: Ala, Asn, Glu, Gly, His Lys, Phe, Thr, Trp and Val;

77 nucleotides for five tRNAs: Arg, Asp, Ile, Pro and Met;

74 and 75 nucleotides for two tRNAs: Cys and Gln, respectively;

85 and 87 nucleotides for two tRNAs: Tyr and Leu, respectively;

90 nucleotides for one tRNA: Ser.

Some modulo 3 differences between the isoaccepting tRNA lengths, e.g. 76 and 73 for Ala, 77 and 74 for Arg etc., could be explained by the presence or absence of the terminal trinucleotide CCA which can be added during processing and therefore, which does not appear in the tRNA genes. Other length differences, e.g. 76 and 75 for Asn, 77 and 76 for Asp etc., could be related to some initial or terminal missing nucleotides.

A similar data analysis is now carrying out with the isoaccepting tRNAs of eukaryotes. Fig. 3
                            gives the histograms representing the numbers of isoaccepting tRNAs of eukaryotes EUK as a function of their lengths. Its distribution greater than 10% of data shows:
                              
                                 (i)
                                 nine tRNAs have a unique preferential length: Asn {74}, Asp {72}, Cys {72}, His {72}, Lys {73}, Phe {73}, Pro {72}, Ser {82} and Val {73};

eight tRNAs have two preferential lengths: Ala {72,73}, Arg {73,85}, Gln {72,85}, Glu {72,73}, Ile {74,94}, Leu {82,83}, Met {73,72} and Trp {72,73};

three tRNAs have three preferential lengths: Gly {71,73,72}, Thr {74,72,73} and Tyr {87,84,89}.

Thus, the preferential lengths of the 20 isoaccepting tRNAs of eukaryotes are:
                              
                                 (i)
                                 72 nucleotides for eight tRNAs: Ala, Asp, Cys, Gln, Glu, His, Pro and Trp;

73 nucleotides for five tRNAs: Arg, Lys, Met, Phe and Val;

74 nucleotides for three tRNAs: Asn, Ile and Thr;

82 nucleotides for two tRNAs: Leu and Ser;

71 and 87 nucleotides for two tRNAs: Gly and Tyr, respectively.

In eukaryotes, three tRNAs Arg {73,85}, Gln {72,85} and Ile {74,94} may be constituted of two length classes having different primary, secondary and tertiary structures.

These tRNA data based on their lengths already demonstrate the well-known great variety of tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This tRNA diversity is also revealed by other parameters, such as: (i) 81 modified nucleotides reported so far (see the RNA Modification Database at http://rna-mdb.cas.albany.edu/RNAmods/, Rozenski et al., 1999) which is the largest number among RNA molecules (rRNA, mRNA, snRNA): D arm with dihydrouridine, T arm with pseudouridine, first anticodon base (wobble base) sometimes modified to inosine, pseudouridine or lysidine; (ii) variability in the secondary structures (stems and loops); (iii) complexity in the tertiary structure with non-Watson–Crick base pairs, etc. This tRNA variability explains the great difficulty of statistical analyses of tRNAs in order to reveal general patterns. This is the reason why several populations of tRNAs based on their lengths and scores will be analysed statistically in order to identify X motifs in tRNAs significantly.

A preliminary statistical analysis shows a significant drop of the number of isoaccepting tRNAs for the nucleotide positions i <−30 and i >36. Thus, the two regions of tRNAs analyzed with the probability

                            (Eq. (8)) use the following nucleotide range [min(s), max(s)]: the 5′ regions in [−30, −1] and the 3′ regions in [1,36] (recall that the anticodon in nucleotide position 0 is excluded). Note that “detailed” statistical analyses outside these nucleotide ranges, i.e. for i <−30 and i >36, may also identify X motifs at the beginning of the 5′ regions and at the end of the 3′ regions of tRNAs. However, this study is not investigated as the purpose here is to perform statistical analyses on tRNA populations, i.e. “large” statistical analyses.

The X motifs analyzed with the three statistical analyses in the 5′ and 3′ regions of the 20 isoaccepting tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes are the X motifs of greatest lengths having at least 9 nucleotides (3 trinucleotides). Indeed, we have recently proved that X motifs of 9 nucleotides retrieve the reading frame with a probability of 99.9% (Table 3
                            and Fig. 4
                            in Michel, 2012). In fact, as Pref

                           (X)={A,C,G,T} (4), the X motifs have at least 10 nucleotides. Thus, the statistical approach developed here may identify the tRNAs with a strong capacity of reading frame retrieval. Such tRNAs could be involved in a translation code (details in Michel, 2012). In the following and for simplification, “distribution of X motifs” means distribution of X motifs of greatest lengths having at least 9 nucleotides in the 5′ and 3′ regions of isoaccepting tRNAs.

This inequality (12) has been studied from two aspects. In combinatorics, two propositions were recently proved on circular codes which are C
                        3 and/or self-complementary:
                           
                              (i)
                              A self-complementary trinucleotide circular code X has two permuted sets X
                                 1 and X
                                 2 which are either both circular codes or both not circular codes (Bussoli et al., 2011).

A trinucleotide circular code X is self-complementary if and only if the two permuted sets X
                                 1 and X
                                 2 are complementary (Bussoli et al., 2012).

In a stochastic approach, we have developed substitution models of gene evolution allowing to explain an asymmetry between the circular codes X
                        1 and X
                        2. Indeed, random substitutions in “primitive” genes based on the circular code X with different rates in the three sites of the 20 trinucleotides of X, rates which can be constant (Arquès et al., 1999) or chaotic (Bahi and Michel, 2008) during time, can generate the codes X
                        1 and X
                        2 according to an unbalanced way and retrieve the probability inequality (12). Nevertheless, the biological foundations of this asymmetry between the circular codes X
                        1 and X
                        2 in genes and now in the 3′ regions of tRNAs remain mysterious and unexplained so far.

In contrast to the 3′ regions, the probability inequality (12) is not observed in the 5′ regions of the tRNA populations of prokaryotes

                     X motifs (circular code motifs) are identified in the 5′ and/or 3′ regions of several isoaccepting tRNAs. For the tRNAs of prokaryotes and with the three statistical analyses (Table 1), eight isoaccepting tRNAs have 3′ X motifs: Ala, Cys, Gly, Ile, Met, Thr, Tyr and Val, four isoaccepting tRNAs have 5′ X motifs: Asn, Asp, Gln and Leu (Gln has also 3′ X motifs in

                     ), and three isoaccepting tRNAs have 5′ and 3′ X motifs: Glu, Lys and Phe. Note that 5′ and 3′ X motifs were already observed in a particular tRNA Phe (Fig. 5 in Michel, 2012). The statistical approach developed does not reveal preferential occurrence of X motifs in five prokaryotic isoaccepting tRNAs: Arg, His, Pro, Ser and Trp. For the tRNAs of eukaryotes and with the three statistical analyses (Table 1), seven isoaccepting tRNAs have 3′ X motifs: Ala, Asn, Gln, Phe, Thr, Tyr and Val, four isoaccepting tRNAs have 5′ X motifs: Gly, Ile, Leu and Pro (Leu has no 5′ X motif in

                     ). No preferential occurrence of X motifs is observed in eight eukaryotic isoaccepting tRNAs: Arg, Asp, Cys, Glu, His, Lys, Ser and Trp (Arg, His and Lys have 3′ X motifs in

                     ). Among the 20 isoaccepting tRNAs, four tRNAs have no identified X motifs both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes: Arg, His, Ser and Trp. Interestingly, the four attached amino acids Arg, His, Ser and Trp are not coded by the trinucleotides of the common trinucleotide circular code X 
                     (1) (see also Table 4(a) in Arquès and Michel, 1996). The circular code X 
                     (1) codes the 12 amino acids Ala, Asn, Asp, Gln, Glu, Gly, Ile, Leu, Phe, Thr, Tyr and Val (Arquès and Michel, 1996) which are attached for the prokaryotes to tRNAs containing all X motifs, and for the eukaryotes to tRNAs containing X motifs except for the two tRNAs Asp and Glu (random curves observed with this statistical approach).

A circular code property (probability inequality (12)) observed in genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Arquès et al., 1999; Bahi and Michel, 2008) is identified in the 3′ regions of 19 isoaccepting tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (except for the tRNA Leu). It suggests that the 3′ regions of tRNAs have a primary structure similar to the primary structure of genes with a “frame” starting from the anticodon: trinucleotides numbered 111, 222, etc. (Fig. 1b). The 5′ regions of tRNAs do not have this gene circular code property which remains unexplained so far.

The identification, using a statistical analysis of large populations of tRNAs, of X motifs of greatest lengths having at least 9 nucleotides which allow to retrieve the reading frame with a probability of 99.9% (Table 3 and Fig. 4 in Michel, 2012) and also of a gene circular code property in tRNAs strengthens the concept proposed in Michel (2012) of a possible translation (framing) code based on a circular code. Short X motifs, i.e. of lengths less than 9 nucleotides, or series of short X motifs may also have a capacity of reading frame retrieval in tRNAs. Indeed, X motifs of 6 nucleotide length retrieve the reading frame with a probability of about 90% (Table 3 and Fig. 4 in Michel, 2012). The statistical analysis of short X motifs in tRNAs should also be investigated in future.
