                  In this paper, we present a low-complexity algorithm for real-time joint user scheduling and receive antenna selection (JUSRAS) in multiuser MIMO systems. The computational complexity of exhaustive search for JUSRAS problem grows exponentially with the number of users and receives antennas. We apply binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) to the joint user scheduling and receive antenna selection problem. In addition to applying the conventional BPSO to JUSRAS, we also present a specific improvement to this population-based heuristic algorithm; namely, we feed cyclically shifted initial population, so that the number of iterations until reaching an acceptable solution is reduced. The proposed BPSO for JUSRAS problem has a low computational complexity, and its effectiveness is verified through simulation results.
