                  The tensor completion problem is to recover a low-n-rank tensor from a subset of its entries. The main solution strategy has been based on the extensions of trace norm for the minimization of tensor rank via convex optimization. This strategy bears the computational cost required by the singular value decomposition (SVD) which becomes increasingly expensive as the size of the underlying tensor increase. In order to reduce the computational cost, we propose a multi-linear low-n-rank factorization model and apply the nonlinear Gauss–Seidal method that only requires solving a linear least squares problem per iteration to solve this model. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can reliably solve a wide range of problems at least several times faster than the trace norm minimization algorithm.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A tensor is a multidimensional array which is the higher-order generalization of vector and matrix. It has many applications in information science, computer vision and graph analysis [1]. In the real world, the size and the amount of redundancy of the data increase fast, and nearly all of the existing high-dimensional real world data either have the natural form of tensor (e.g. multi-channel images and videos) or can be grouped into the form of tensor (e.g. tensor face [2]). Therefore, challenges come up in many areas when one confronts with the high-dimensional real world data. Tensor decomposition is a popular tool for high-dimensional data processing, analysis and visualization. Two particular tensor decomposition methods can be considered as higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) [3,4] and the Tucker [5]. Tensor decomposition gives a concise representation of the underlying structure of tensor, revealing when the tensor data can be modeled as lying close to a low-dimensional subspace. Although useful, they are not as powerful. For general tensors, tensor decomposition does not deliver best low rank approximation, which will limit its applications.

In this paper, we will try to recover a low-n-rank tensor from a subset of its entries. This problem is called the tensor completion problem. It is also called missing value estimation problem of tensors. The problem in computer vision and graphics is known as image and video in-painting problem [6,7]. The key factor to solve this problem is how to build up the relationship between the known elements and the unknown ones. Owing to this reason, the algorithms for completing tensors can be coarsely divided into local algorithms and global algorithms. Local algorithms [8,9] assume that the further apart two points are, the smaller their dependence is and the missing entries mainly depend on their neighbors. Thus, the local algorithms can only exploit the information of the adjacent entries. However, sometimes the values of the missing entries depend on the entries which are far away and the local algorithms cannot take advantage of a global property of tensors. Therefore, in order to utilize the information of tensors as much as possible, it is necessary to develop global algorithms that can directly capture the complete information of tensors to solve the tensor completion problem.

In the two-dimensional case, i.e. the matrix, the rank is a powerful tool to capture the global information and can be directly determined. But for the high-dimensional case, i.e. the tensor, there is no polynomial algorithm to determine the rank of a specific given tensor. Recently, based on the extensions of trace norm for the minimization of tensor rank, some global algorithms [6,7,10–12] solving the tensor completion problem via convex optimization have been proposed. Liu et al. [6] first proposed the definition of the trace norm of an n-mode tensor as

                     . And similar to matrix completion, the tensor completion was formulated as a convex optimization problem. For tackling this problem, they developed a relaxation technique to separate the dependant relationships and used the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to achieve a globally optimal solution. The contribution of this paper is realized at the methodological level by considering a more general kind of the tensor completion problem. By the extension of the concept of Shatten-q norm for matrix, Signoretto et al. [10] defined tensor Shatten-{p, q} norm, which is formulated as

                     . Though the general tensor Shatten-{p, q} norm was defined in this paper, they mainly focused on the special case trace norm of tensor in their algorithm. Similar to the above two works, Gandy et al. [7] used the n-rank of a tensor as sparsity measurement and tried to find the tensor of lowest n-rank that satisfies some linear constraints. In their algorithm, the tensor completion was converted into a multi-linear convex optimization problem. Based on the Douglas–Rachford splitting technique [13,14] and the alternating direction method of multipliers [15], trace norm was introduced as the convex envelope of the n-rank and an efficient algorithm to solve the multi-linear convex optimization problem was proposed. In these trace norm based algorithms, they consider the tensor completion problem as recovering a low-n-rank tensor from a subset of its entries, that is,

                      denotes the trace norm defined by the sum of all singular values of the matrix. On the other hand, Zhang et al. [16] exploited the recently proposed tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) [17] that is a group theoretic framework to solve the tensor compression and recovery problem. They first constructed novel tensor-rank like measures to characterize informational and structural complexity of tensor.

The core strategy of all these algorithms to achieve the optimal solution is the same as that they estimate the variables sequentially, followed by certain refinement in each iteration. Although the details of the solution procedure in each algorithm are different, unfortunately, the refinement in each iteration of all these algorithms requires computing singular value decompositions(SVD) that a task is increasingly costly as the tensor size and n-ranks increase. It is therefore desirable to exploit an alternative algorithm more efficient in solving tensor completion problem.

In this paper, a new global algorithm for tensor completion called tensor completion via a multi-linear low-n-rank factorization model (TC-MLFM) is proposed. As the size and structure of each mode of the given tensor are not always the same (e.g. RGB images), the new algorithm combines n-ranks of each tensor mode by weighted parameters. However, the problem is that the function is generally NP-hard and hard to approximate due to the non-convex optimization of

                        )
                     . To solve this problem, we use n-rank factorization optimization problem to substitute 
                        r
                        a

                        )
                     . The new function is solvable and considered as our model. With the new weighted objective model, the proposed algorithm can utilize the mode information of the tensor with choice. To solve this model, a minimization method based on the nonlinear Gauss–Seidal method [18] that only requires solving a linear least squares problem per iteration is applied. By adopting this method along each mode of the tensor other than minimizing the trace norm in Eq. (1), the new algorithm can avoid the SVD computational strategy and reliably solve a wide range of tensor completion problems much faster than the trace norm minimization algorithm.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some notations and basic properties of tensors. In section 3, we review the definition of Tucker decomposition and tensor n-rank, which suggests that a low-n-rank tensor is a low rank matrix when appropriately unfolded. Section 4 discusses the detailed process of the proposed algorithm. Section 5 reports experimental results of our algorithm on simulated data and image completion. Finally, section 6 provides some concluding remarks.

In this paper, the nomenclatures and the notations in [1,19] on tensor are partially adopted. Scalars are denoted by lowercase letters (a, b, c, …), vectors by bold lowercase letters (

                     , 
                        b
                     , 
                        c
                     , …) and matrices by uppercase letters (A, B, C, …). Tensors are written as calligraphic letters

                     , respectively, the core tensor 
                        S
                      can be thought of as a compressed version of 
                        A
                      and then we consider 
                        A
                      as a low-n-rank tensor. Formally, 
                        A
                      is called low-n-rank tensor if its unfoldings are low-rank matrices. Thus we can use the ranks of unfoldings of a tensor 
                        A
                      to learn low-n-rank tensor 
                        A
                     . This rank should not be confused with the idea of tensor CP-rank [3,4]. An illustration of Tucker model for third-order tensors is given in 
                     Fig. 1. For notational simplicity, we illustrate our results in this paper using third order tensors, while generalizations to high order cases are straightforward.

This section is separated into two parts. Part 1 extends the matrix completion problem to tensor case and converts the tensor completion problem into a weighted multi-linear low-n-rank factorization model. Part 2 applies the nonlinear Gauss–Seidal method to solve the objective model and presents the details of solution procedure.

The derivation starts with the well-known optimization problem for the low rank matrix completion [20,21]:

                         are given while the remaining elements are missing. Eq. (7) aims to use a low rank matrix L to approximate the given matrix with missing elements. The optimization problem in Eq. (7) is a non-convex optimization problem since the function 
                           r
                           a

The definition of CP-rank, in the form of

                           X
                           )
                        , is the minimum number of rank-1 tensors that generate 
                           X
                         as their sum [3,4]. In other words, CP-rank is the minimum number of components in an exact CP decomposition. The CP-rank of a tensor is defined as an exact analogue to the definition of matrix rank, but the properties of matrix are quite different from that of tensors. For instance, the CP-rank of a real-valued tensor may actually be different from mode to mode. One major difference between matrix rank and tensor CP-rank is that there is no straightforward algorithm to determine the CP-rank of a specific given tensor. Therefore, Eq. (8) is difficult to solve. In fact, the problem is NP-hard [1,22].

On the other hand, the n-rank is defined as the dimension of the vector space spanned by the mode-n unfolding matrix. As discussed in Section 3, when the given tensor is a low-n-rank tensor, the n-ranks instead of the CP-rank of a tensor can be used to capture its global information. Therefore, we can minimize the n-ranks of the given tensor instead of minimizing the CP-rank to solve the tensor completion problem. As a result, a function 
                           F
                         which minimizes the n-ranks of the given tensor to replace Eq. (8) is obtained as the following shows:

                        Eq. (10) aims to find a low-n-rank tensor 
                           ℒ
                         to approximate the given tensor with missing elements. A tensor is a multidimensional array or an element of the tensor product of N vector spaces. That is to say matrix is special instance of tensor.

By comparing Eq. (10) to Eq. (7), we can observe that Eq. (10) is derived from the tensor completion problem and can be viewed as a weighted multi-linear matrix completion problem. In other words, matrix completion problem is also a special instance of tensor completion problem.

Although the elements involved in are all matrices, it is a highly non-convex optimization problem since the optimism function includes n-ranks. Without converts there is no efficient solution to this optimization problem [23]. In this paper, our goal is finding a low-n-rank tensor

The core idea of this strategy is to optimize a group of variables while fixing the other groups. The variables in the optimization are

                     which is derived as the substitution to their original problem Eq. (1). The codes for our algorithm and LRTC both are implemented under the Matlab environment. All the experiments are conducted and timed on the same desktop with an AMD Athlon(tm)×4 640 Professor 3GHZ CPU and 4GB RAM.

A major challenge of our algorithm is the selection of parameters and the initial values. In experiments, we simply set the parameters and the initial values as follows:

                         is the recovered tensor from the tensor with missing entries.

Firstly, the ability of our algorithm in recovering low-n-rank tensors with missing elements is tested. We address this recoverability issue by generating phase diagram and curve diagram in 
                        
                        Figs. 2 and 3. The simulated tensors used in this test are of size 
                           150
                           ×
                           150
                           ×
                           150
                         with the missing ratio mr chosen in the order as it appears in {0.05:0.05:0.95} and with each n-ranks value of {[555]:[222]:[494,949]}. In each case, TC-MLFM is run on 10 random instances. The phase diagram depicts the average value out of every 10 runs by our algorithm for each test case. A run was successful when the LRSE between the true and the recovered was smaller than 
                           
                              
                                 10
                              
                              
                                 −
                                 3
                              
                           
                        . In Fig. 2, a white box indicates a successful recovery, while a black box means a failing recovery. Fig. 3 plots the average LRSE corresponding to the set of missing ratio mr with different n-ranks, respectively. For all cases with different n-rank, the average LRSE increase gradually with the increase of mr. That is to say if our algorithm recovers the random instance successfully for 
                           m
                           r
                           =
                           α
                         and n-rank 
                           =
                           β
                        , then it ought to have equal or higher recoverability for 
                           m
                           r
                           <
                           α
                         and n-rank 
                           =
                           β
                        . Thus, it is concluded that TC-MLFM is particularly sensitive to the change of 
                           m
                           r
                         for this class of problems over a considerable range. Furthermore, under the condition of fixed 
                           
                           m
                           r
                        , it can be seen from Fig. 3 that the smaller the n-rank, the smaller the LRSE minimum is.

According to the above experiments, it is reasonable to infer that TC-MLFM is an acceptable algorithm to solve the low-n-rank tensor completion problem. However, an important question about the proposed algorithm is whether or not it is able to recover low-n-rank tensors similar to that of solving the trace norm minimization approach. Or simply put, does our algorithm provide a comparable recoverability to that of a good trace norm minimization algorithm? In the following part of this section, we will answer this question. Using numerical simulations, the proposed TC-MLFM algorithm is compared with LRTC algorithm [6]. The numerical simulated tensors used in our experiments are both of the same size and different size along each mode. A brief comparison of the two algorithms is presented in 
                        
                        Tables 2 and 3 (across 10 instances), where time denotes the CPU time measured in seconds and

                         denotes the relative square error between the true and the recovered tensors. From the data in Tables 2 and 3, TC-MLFM algorithm is at least several times (often a few orders of magnitude) faster than the LRTC algorithm while the results of TC-MLFM are comparable to LRTC in terms of accuracy. Of course, the reported performances of the two solvers involved are pertinent to their tested versions under the specific testing environment. Improved performances are possible for different parameter settings, on different test problems, or by different versions. However, given the magnitude of the time between TC-MLFM and LRTC, the advantage in speed of TC-MLFM should be more than evident on these test problems.

In the above experiments, we tested the proposed algorithm on numerical simulations and compared it with LRTC. The numerical simulated experiments can be considered as low-n-rank tensor completion problems because the given samples are from a true low-n-rank tensor. In the following experiments, the proposed algorithm is applied on real data. The given samples of real data are taken from a tensor of mathematically full n-ranks. Therefore, the problem is considered as the low-n-rank approximation. The key difference between the two classes lies in whether a given sample is from a true low-n-rank tensor (with or without noise) or not. In fact, low-n-rank approximation is more frequently used in practical applications.

One straightforward application of our algorithm is image completion. In this section, we outline the image completion examples with three different types of data: façade image, natural image and CT/MRI image. In the following tables, time denotes the CPU time measured in seconds and

The top row of Fig. 5 shows the original image with 40%, 50%, 60% and 70% randomly missing entries from left to right, respectively. The second row shows the recovered image by TC-MLFM. The third row shows the recovered image by LRTC. The bottom image is the original data.


                        
                        Table 5 tabulates the RSE and CPU time of TC-MLFM and LRTC on natural image. From the data in Table 5, it can be seen that TC-MLFM algorithm is at least several times faster than the LRTC algorithm while the results of accuracy are better than LRTC.


                        MRI image: In this part for the experiments we used MRI images, which contain 140 slices through a human brain, each having dimensions 
                           217
                           ×
                           181
                        . So the input data is a third-order tensor of dimensions 
                           217
                           ×
                           181
                           ×
                           140
                        . The missing entries were randomly removed with different percent and the randomly select pixels for removal are shown in white. 
                        Fig. 6 shows a recovery experiment of five slices in the MRI images. The top row shows the five slices of the original data. The second row shows the original image with 50% randomly missing entries. The third row shows the recovered image by TC-MLFM. The bottom row shows the recovered image by LRTC.


                        
                        Table 6 tabulates the RSE and CPU time of TC-MLFM and LRTC on MRI image. From the data in Table 6, it is observed that TC-MLFM algorithm is several times faster than the LRTC algorithm while the results of TC-MLFM are better than LRTC in terms of accuracy.

In the above, the proposed algorithm is applied to image completion, such as façade image completion, natural image completion, and CT/MRI image completion. Besides image completion, may be the proposed algorithm can be used in other areas such as text mining, image classification, and video indexing. In [25], Dunlavy et al. analyzed data with multiple link types and derived feature vectors for each individual node. For the multiple linkages, a third order tensor was used, where each two-dimensional frontal slice represents the adjacency matrix for a single link type. Our algorithm is also a tensor based algorithm. The data used in [25] can be seen as a special case of our algorithm input. In [26], Zha et al. considered image classification as both a multi-label learning and multi-instance learning problem. Based on hidden conditional random fields, they proposed an integrated multi-label multi-instance learning approach, which simultaneously captures both the connections between semantic labels and regions. Thus, they formulated correlations among the labels in a single model. As is known that tensor is a useful tool for representing multi-mode correlations, and tensor decompositions facilitate a type of correlation analysis that incorporates all mode correlation simultaneously. In [27], based on the optimum experimental design criteria in statistics, Zha et al. proposed a novel video indexing approach that makes use of labeled and unlabeled data and simultaneously exploits sample’s local structure, and sample relevance, density, and diversity information. In our knowledge, tensor also can formulate these elements into one model and mining the correlations between them simultaneously. And in the former work, we have applied tensor recovery into background modeling using video data [28] and traffic data completion [29]. In the future, we will investigate the applications of our algorithm to these areas.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we extend the low-rank matrix completion problem to a low-n-rank tensor completion problem and propose an efficient algorithm based on the multi-linear low-n-rank factorization model. For the solution of this model, the nonlinear Gauss–Seidal method that only requires solving a linear least squares problem per iteration is applied. Thus, the proposed algorithm can avoid the singular value decompositions (SVD) strategy which is much time cost. And the proposed algorithm can automatically complete a low-n-rank tensor with missing entries. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on both simulated data and real data. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm is much less computational cost than the trace norm minimization algorithm especially facing the large data. Different applications in image completion show the applicability of our proposed algorithm in the real world data.

In the future, we would like to investigate how to automatically choose the optimal weighted parameters in our algorithm and develop more efficient algorithm for tensor completion problem. Also we will explore additional applications of our method in the real world data.
