                  Unique Inputâ€“Output sequences (UIOs) are quite commonly used in conformance testing. Unfortunately finding UIOs of minimal length is an NP hard problem. This study presents a hybrid approach to generate UIOs automatically on a basis of the finite state machine (FSM) specification. The proposed hybrid approach harnesses the benefits of hill climbing (Greedy search) and heuristic algorithm. Hill climbing, which exploits domain knowledge, is capable of quickly generating good result however it may get stuck in local minimum. To overcome the problem we used a set of parameters called the seed, which allows the algorithm to generate different results for a different seed. The hill climbing generates solutions implied by the seed while the Genetic Algorithm is used as the seed generator. We compared the hybrid approach with Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Greedy Algorithm, and Random Search. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed hybrid approach outperforms other methods. More specifically, we showed that Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing exhibit similar performance while both of them outperform Greedy Algorithm. Finally, we generalize the proposed hybrid approach to seed-driven hybrid architectures and elaborate on how it can be adopted to a broad range of optimization problems.
