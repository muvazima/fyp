                  The nucleolus is one of the most important solution concepts in cooperative game theory as a result of its attractive properties - it always exists (if the imputation is non-empty), is unique, and is always in the core (if the core is non-empty). However, computing the nucleolus is very challenging because it involves the lexicographical minimization of an exponentially large number of excess values. We present a method for computing the nucleoli of large games, including some structured games with more than 50 players, using nested linear programs (LP). Although different variations of the nested LP formulation have been documented in the literature, they have not been used for large games because of the large size and number of LPs involved. In addition, subtle issues such as how to deal with multiple optimal solutions and with tight constraint sets need to be resolved in each LP in order to formulate and solve the subsequent ones. Unfortunately, this technical issue has been largely overlooked in the literature. We treat these issues rigorously and provide a new nested LP formulation that is smaller in terms of the number of large LPs and their sizes. We provide numerical tests for several games, including the general flow games, the coalitional skill games and the weighted voting games, with up to 100 players.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The nucleolus is one of the most important solution concepts for cooperative games with transferable utilities. It represents a way to distribute the reward (or cost) among the players involved in a way that lexicographically minimizes the excess values (i.e. dissatisfaction levels) of all coalitions. The nucleolus was introduced in 1969 by Schmeidler (1969) as a solution concept with attractive properties - it always exists (if the imputation is non-empty), it is unique, and it lies in the core (if the core is non-empty). We review concepts in cooperative game theory and their mathematical definitions in Section 2.1. The nucleolus concept has been used in many different applications. For example, in the banking industry, groups of banks enter into an agreement for their customers to use ATM machines owned by any bank in the same group. The nucleolus is then used to suggest how the cost of installing and maintaining those ATM machines can be shared among the banks (see Gow & Thomas (1998)). It has also been applied to insurance premium setting (Lemaire (1991)) and to network cost sharing (Deng, Fang, and Sun (2009) 
                     Granot and Huberman (1984) 
                     Granot and Maschler (1998)), among many other applications.

Despite the desirable properties that the nucleolus has, its computation is, however, very challenging because the process involves the lexicographical minimization of 2
                        n
                      excess values, where n is the number of players. Kohlberg (1971) provides a necessary and sufficient condition for an imputation to be the nucleolus. However, the criterion requires forming the coalition array of all 2
                        n
                      possible coalitions and then making sure 2
                        n
                      linear inequalities are satisfied. The analytical form of the nucleolus is only available for games with three players (see Leng & Parlar (2010)). There are a small number of games whose nucleoli can be computed in polynomial time. These include the connected games in Solymosi and Raghavan (1994), the neighbor games in Hamers, Klijn, Solymosi, Tijs, and Vermeulen (2003), the cyclic permutation games in Solymosi, Raghavan, and Tijs (2005), and the flow games with unit capacities in Deng et al. (2009) 
                     Kern and Paulusma (2009) 
                     Potters, Reijnierse, and Biswas (2006). It has been shown that finding the nucleolus is NP-hard for many classes of games such as the utility games with non-unit capacities (Deng et al. (2009)) and the weighted voting games (Elkind, Goldberg, Goldberg, & Wooldridge (2007)). In fact, finding the core and the least core is NP-hard in supermodular games Schulz and Uhan (2010) and inventory centralization games Chen and Zhang (2009).


                     Kopelowitz (1967) suggests using nested linear programming (LP) to compute the kernel of a game. This encouraged a number of researchers to compute the nucleolus using linear programming. For example, Kohlberg (1972) presents a single LP with 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              2
                              n
                           
                           !
                           )
                        
                      constraints. The number of constraints in the LP formulation of Owen (1974) is reduced to 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              4
                              n
                           
                           )
                        
                      but the coefficients get larger. The nucleolus can also be found by solving a sequence of LPs. However, the number of LPs involved is exponentially large (i.e. 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              4
                              n
                           
                           )
                        
                      in Maschler, Peleg, and Shapley (1979) and 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              2
                              n

                      in Sankaran (1991)). Potters, Reijnierse, and Ansing (1996) present another formulation that involves solving 
                        
                           (
                           n

                      linear programs with, at most, 
                        
                           (
                           
                              2
                              n
                           
                           +
                           n
                           −
                           1
                           )
                        
                      rows and 
                        
                           (
                           
                              2

                      columns. The authors also develop a prolonged Simplex method for solving these large LPs and conduct numerical experiments for games with 10 players. Derks and Kuipers (1997) improve the implementation of the prolonged Simplex method in Potters et al. (1996) and provide numerical results for games with 20 players. Göthe-Lundgren, Jörnsten, and Värbrand (1996) attempted to apply a constraint generation framework to find the nucleoli of basic vehicle routing games. However, some of results are incorrect as has been pointed out by Chardaire (2001). The issue of having multiple optimal solutions in each LP was not considered in Göthe-Lundgren et al. (1996), but we are able to deal with that in Section 3.3. Fromen (1997) uses Gaussian elimination to improve the formulation of Sankaran (1991) and to reduce the number of LPs in the implementation. Nevertheless, the LPs are still extremely large when the number of players gets large and existing methods become intractable when n exceeds 20. In the nested LPs formulation, subsequent LPs are formed based on the optimal solutions of the previous LPs and the tight inequalities. One needs to be very careful if there are multiple optimal solutions to these LPs and if there are multiple coalitions with the same worst excess values. The paper provides a rigorous treatment of the nested LPs formulation which deals with these issues.

For each payoff distribution, there are 2
                        n
                      excess values that correspond to 2
                        n
                      possible coalitions. The nucleolus is the payoff distribution that lexicographically minimizes its excess values. Thus finding the nucleolus effectively is only possible if one can find the worst coalition(s) for a given imputation efficiently. Faigle, Kern, and Kuipers (2001) show that the nucleolus can be found in polynomial time if finding the worst coalition for a given imputation, i.e. the separation problem, can be done in polynomial time. Their method is based on the ellipsoid algorithm which, although theoretically has a polynomial runtime, does not perform well in practice. Our paper bridges this gap and presents a practical numerical procedure for computing the nucleolus. We test our algorithm with the coalitional skill games and the weighted voting game.

The key contributions of our work include:

                        
                           •
                           We present a nested LPs formulation for computing the nucleoli of cooperative games. Although the idea of using a nested LPs framework has been around for more than 40 years ago (Kopelowitz (1967)) with various reformulations having been proposed, these methods face several issues that will be described in detail in Section 2.4. The most critical issue among these is how to handle multiple optimal solutions in each of the large LPs. Dealing with multiple optimal solutions is often needed in multi-level programming and is often very challenging. We provide a concrete method for dealing with these issues in Sections 3.3 and 4.3.

The size of our nested LPs formulation is smaller than other nested LPs formulation described in the literature as can be seen in Table 1
                              . The number of LPs to be solved in our method is smaller than that in Maschler et al. (1979) and Sankaran (1991) while the number of columns in each LP is smaller than that in Potters et al. (1996). These features are results of our special way of handling tight coalitions and finding the minimal tight sets (the key idea in Theorem 3 and the main results in Theorem 1).

We provide numerical computation for large and structured games with up to 100 players in the weighted voting games Aziz, Paterson, and Leech (2007) 
                              Chalkiadakis, Elkind, and Wooldridge (2011) and up to 75 players in the coalitional skill games Bachrach and Rosenschein (2008). This is a significant improvement compared to the literature where numerical results are shown for computing the nucleoli of games with at most 20 players.

In addition to these key contributions, we also apply a constraint generation framework for solving the large LPs. This gives hope to solving very large LPs as we don’t have to rely on the simplex method to solve large scale LPs when n ≥ 25. The constraint generation algorithm is not new and has been applied successfully in many areas including finding the solutions of cooperative games (e.g. Caprara & Letchford (2010)). Applying it to solving nested LPs though creates some challenging problems in keeping track of multiple discrete and continuous optimal solutions so that subsequent LPs can be formulated. Our approach is appropriate for large games and for combinatorial games where it is costly to calculate the characteristic values for all the possible coalitions. For example, in the flow games proposed by Kalai and Zemel (1982), the value of a coalition is the maximum flow that can be sent through the subnetwork using edges in the coalition only. In this case, it is time consuming to calculate all the 2
                        n
                      possible values. Instead, we can incorporate the maximum flow problem into the constraint generation problem that is then solved only if needed. We also demonstrate how this can be done in other games such as the voting games and the coalitional skills games.

The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2.1 provides the list of notations used throughout the paper and a review of important solution concepts in cooperative game theory such as the core, the least core, and the nucleolus. We present the idea behind the nested LPs and their formulation in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 with an illustrative example. The focus of this paper starts from Section 2.4 where the subtle issues relating to the nested LPs formulation are discussed in detail. The main contribution of this paper lies in addressing these issues in Section 3. We present the framework for finding the nucleolus in Section 3.2 and the idea of finding optimal solutions with minimal tight sets in Section 3.3. Our algorithm requires solving at most

This includes a constraint generation method for solving these large LPs in Section 4.1 and the idea of using representative sets for keeping track of tight constraints in Section 4.3. Various numerical experiments are presented in Section 6 and conclusion is drawn in Section 7.

Throughout this manuscript, we denote 
                           ν
                         as the nucleolus and 
                           I
                         as the imputation set. We assume that 
                           I
                         is non-empty. However, the calculation of the prenucleolus can be done using the same method except that we relaxed the constraint 
                           
                              x
                              ∈
                              I
                           
                         in calculating the nucleolus. The algorithm for finding the nucleolus presented in this paper involves solving several sub-problems. These sub-problems are referred to throughout the paper by a list of acronyms that are included in Appendix A.

This section provides only a brief review of cooperative game theory. We refer the interested readers to Chalkiadakis et al. (2011) 
                        Peleg and Sudhölter (2007) for more thorough introduction of the topic.

Before going into further details on the algorithm, we need to define the concept of tight set as it is directly related to the definition of lexicographical minimization and will be crucial in formulating the nested LPs.

Solving this problem can provide us with the worst excess value that the nucleolus will produce. However, the LP problem can have multiple optimal solutions and we are not guaranteed that the optimal solution produced is the nucleolus. In addition, two distinct optimal solutions might have different tight sets and the tight sets might have different sizes. We only know that the nucleolus must correspond to an optimal solution

                         worst excess values equal to ϵ* are considered. The second set of constraints and the objective function aim to minimize the worst excess values among all the remaining coalitions. Solving this LP will produce for us another set of tight coalitions

The nested LPs formulation presented in the literature is usually in the form of Model (1) described above. To provide a clearer connection between this nested LPs formulation and our methods for finding the nucleolus (to be described in Sections 3 and 4), we will first reformulate these LPs slightly.

                         and the set of all the optimal solutions (the least core solutions) is exactly the core. Solving LP1
                         will produce for us a least core solution. However, depending on the solver we use, we might end up with one of the extreme points (e.g. if we use the simplex method) or a relative interior point (e.g. if we use an interior point method). The tight sets that correspond to these optimal solutions are:

However, there are several practical issues that need to be addressed:

                                 For large games, the problem becomes even more challenging when the tight sets have exponential sizes (this occurs in many games such as the weighted voting games). If this is the case, how can we formulate and solve the subsequent LPs given that we might not have the resources to compute the entire set

                                 ?
                              

As far as we have understood, although the nested LPs formulation was formulated by Kopelowitz (1967) in 1967 and various reformulations have been presented, very limited numerical tests have been performed. In addition, all of these experiments are only for small games, i.e. Potters et al. (1996) provide numerical tests for games with at most 10 players, Derks and Kuipers (1997) and Fromen (1997) improve existing methods to provide numerical tests for games with no more than 20 players. We presume that there are two main reasons behind this. First of all, the LPs has 2
                           n
                         constraints and hence are difficult to solve in practice. The second and more critical reason lies on the difficulty of handling the multiple optimal solutions in each LP (Issue 2).


                        Potters et al. (1996) and Derks and Kuipers (1997) recognize the first two aforementioned issues and attempt to resolve them using a prolonged simplex method. However, their method does not scale well because of the large LPs involved. Issue 1 has been recognized in the literature and the conventional stopping condition is when the tight constraints produce a unique solution. The number of LPs to be solved is bounded by the number of players in Derks and Kuipers (1997) 
                        Potters et al. (1996) thanks to their special way of avoiding having to solve redundant LPs. Issue 3 has been recognized by Elkind and Pasechnik (2009). Under these situations, their ellipsoid method requires the assumption that the size of 
                           
                              T
                              k
                              *
                           
                         is known. Our paper deals issue 3 without this assumption. This is done by replacing 
                           
                              T
                              k
                              *
                           
                         with a representative set with size at most n. This not only helps to resolve issue 3, but also makes the LPs formulation smaller, and thus easier to store and solve.

First, we notice that if we solve the nested LP formulation described in Section 2.3 directly, we might end up solving as many large LPs as there are distinct levels of 
                           
                              ϵ
                              k
                              *
                           
                         before obtaining a full rank

                        . However, we notice that once the equality constraints in LPk
                         are enforced, i.e.

                         are constant and there is no reason to minimize them. That is, LPk
                         should only try to minimize the largest among the remaining (non-constant) excess values. We can, therefore, use the same approach as in Derks and Kuipers (1997) 
                        Potters et al. (1996) to reformulate the nested LPs and to show that the total number of large LPs that we need to solve is at most

The intuition for the correctness of Algorithm 1 in producing the nucleolus has been described in the construction of LPk
                         in Section 2.3 and in the reformulation to 
                           
                              
                                 LP

                              k
                           
                         in Section 3.1. However, since these sections only provided a constructive and informal proof and since many existing literature only provided a claim that nested LPs can be used to compute the nucleolus without a formal proof, we take this opportunity to provide a concrete result stated in the following theorem.

                           Theorem 2

                                 Algorithm 1
                               
                              is the nucleolus of the game

                                    ,
                                    v
                                    )

Part of the proof of this theorem is based on the following two lemmas which state that the nested LPs are uniquely constructed despite

                         might produce multiple optimal solutions.

                         now looks like that in Derks and Kuipers (1997) but notice that the key difference is in our method to obtain an optimal solution with the minimal tight set. To improve the optimal solution found, our key contribution is Theorem 3 where we just need to solve small LPs to find another optimal solution with smaller tight set. Our method differs from Potters et al. (1996) in the size of the LPs. In our formulation,

We found many references in the literature that include only Step 2 of Algorithm 1 when presenting the algorithm for finding the nucleolus. This seems to create a common perception within the research community that the nucleolus can be found by solving a nested LPs (without concerning about which optimal solution in each LP to choose). As we have shown in the simple example in Section 2.3 and the list of issues presented in Section 2.4, choosing the right optimal solution with the minimal tight set is crucially needed for formulating subsequent LPs and hence Step 3 described in Algorithm 1 is needed.

However, from this solution, we can find an improved imputation with smaller tight set as will be described in Theorem 3. Before presenting this theorem, we first describe some additional notation. Let σ be the smallest excess value that corresponds to

                         is still an improved optimal solution. Once we have obtained αmax

                           x
                         to avoid numerical error. Second, 
                           
                              y

                         is more likely to be closer to the nucleolus and hence can speed up our algorithm.

In this section we aim to solve 
                           
                              
                                 LP
                                 ^
                              
                              k
                           
                         efficiently. This task is feasible for any cooperative games with the number of players less than around 20 since linear programming solvers such as the Simplex method can handle the LP efficiently. For larger games, since the LP has an exponentially large number of constraints, it is often very difficult to solve. We need to make an assumption that the characteristic function has some special forms that allows us to exploit and solve 
                           
                              
                                 LP
                                 ^
                              
                              k
                           
                        . This assumption is quite reasonable in the quest for finding the nucleolus because, without it, even solving for the core or the least core has already proved difficult. We demonstrate this possibility through some combinatorial games to which the well-known constraint generation (CG) approach can be applied to solve 
                           
                              
                                 LP
                                 ^
                              
                              k
                           
                        .

We notice that most of the constraints in 
                           
                              
                                 LP
                                 ^
                              
                              k
                           
                         are non-binding at optimal solutions. In fact, Reijnierse and Potters (1998) show that there exist a set of 
                           
                              2
                              (
                              n
                              −
                              1
                              )
                           
                         coalitions that determines the nucleolus. That means we can still find an optimal solution by including only a subset of constraints. The idea of the constraint generation (CG) algorithm is to start with a relaxed problem and then to check whether the optimal solution of the relaxed problem satisfies all the constraints in the original problem. If that is the case, then the solution to the relaxed problem is also an optimal solution of the original problem. Otherwise, we have identified a violating constraint and that can be added to the relaxed problem. Let

                              S
                              *
                           
                         to the relaxed constraint set 
                           
                              C

                         and repeat the process. The formal constraint generation algorithm is described below:
                     

An attractive property of the constraint generation algorithm is that the lower bounds ϵ(j) are increasing through iterations. We can show that the constraint generation algorithm never enters a loop of reintroducing coalitions into 
                           
                              C
                              r
                           
                        . The proof for the correctness of the stopping condition in the iterative loop is quite standard and we skip it for brevity. In addition, since the set 
                           C
                         of all the possible coalitions is finite while the set 
                           
                              C
                              r
                           
                         keeps expanding, the constraint generation algorithm will terminate at an optimal solution. This is independent of the starting imputation 
                           x

The CG algorithm (sometimes referred to as the delayed constraint generation or cutting plane method) has been successfully applied to problems involving an exponentially large number of constraints and it could potentially be used for finding the least core. It is noted, however, that applying the CG algorithm to find the nucleolus is not straightforward because of the following two main issues

                           
                              (a)
                              How to solve the constraint generation problem efficiently?

How to deal with multiple optimal solutions and the tight sets. The CG algorithm often returns only a small subset of all the tight constraints because many of these constraints are relaxed in the restricted problem. How can we assess the size of the tight set of the optimal solution obtained against that of other optimal solutions?

Issue (a) is a typical issue when applying the CG framework to solve a generic optimization problem while issue (b) is specific to the case of finding the nucleolus. In the first issue, we want to solve the problem

                         will be even harder to solve. However, the equality constraints can be represented by mk
                         constraints where mk
                         is the rank of

                         representative vectors (coalitions), the equality constraints will be tractable. The issue is then how we can create this representative set. The simplest way is to keep introducing new tight coalitions until we can no longer improve the rank of

                        . However, this method only works if the size of the tight set is not too large. If the tight set is large, we have no way to check whether the tight constraints found so far can form the representative set unless we have already had a full rank set (but it could be the case that

                         does not have full rank and we would not know when to stop). A better way is to introduce only tight coalitions that can increase the rank of

                         to obtain an optimal solution (i.e. Step 2), find its representative set in Step 3, and find an optimal solution with the minimal representative set in Step 4. This process is repeated at most n times until the minimal tight set has full rank. A demonstration of how Algorithm 1 works on a small flow game is presented in Section 6.3.

We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm to three classes of games. In these games, the entire characteristic functions are costly to be computed for instances with more than 25 players, e.g. it might involve solving up to 2
                        n
                      optimisation problems just for getting the input of the general flow games Kalai and Zemel (1982). We show that by using the constraint generation framework, we can eliminate this stage and only compute some of the characteristic values by searching for the most violating constraints.

                           E

                           S
                        . Deng et al. (2009) show that finding the nucleolus is NP-hard for general flow games. The nucleolus can only be found in polynomial time if all the edges have unit capacities. Even in that case, the algorithm relies on the ellipsoid method which performs poorly in practice.

In order to apply the constraint generation framework, we need to find the worst coalition for a current proposal

In the weighted voting games (WVG), each player has a voting weight and a coalition receives a payoff of one if the total voting weight of the coalition’s members exceeds some threshold and a payoff of zero otherwise (see Elkind et al. (2007)

                        Leech (2003) for details). WVGs have many applications in political science, reliability theory and computer science (see Aziz et al. (2007) and the references therein). Let wi
                         be the number of votes that player i has. A coalition

                         is not straightforward, especially for WVG with exponentially large tight sets. In addition, the polynomial running time property that the authors derived is based on the ellipsoid method which does not perform well in practice. Despite these NP-hardness results, we will show that, by using our method, the WVG can be solved efficiently for instances involving sizes up to 100 players.

                        Weighted coalitional skill games (WCSG) were proposed by Bachrach and Rosenschein (2008). In this game, there are n agents, T tasks and K skills. Each agent has a subset of skills and each task requires a subset of skills. Let Ψ be the agent-skill matrix with binary indicator ψik
                         denoting whether agent i has skill k. Let Φ be the task-skill matrix with binary indicator ϕtk
                         denoting whether task t requires skill k. For each task t, and the skill vector Φt
                         that it requires, the coalition 
                           z
                         will be able to perform the task if there exists at least one agent in the coalition that has skill ϕtk
                        . We consider a weighted average utility function defined as follows. Let Δ(
                           z
                        , t) be the binary indicator on whether coalition 
                           z
                         can perform task t. Then the coalition value is defined as

                         should be equal to one to drive the objective function to the optimum. The constraint generation problem is a mixed integer programming problem with

In our numerical experiments, we start with a small flow game to demonstrate the steps involved in our algorithm. Simulated large weighted voting games and coalitional skill games with 25 to 100 players are presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in detail.

                        . Using the CG algorithm, we obtain an optimal solution after only 16 iterations. The tight set produced by the last relaxed LP outputs only four tight constraints among the total of 135 tight constraints. Instead of iteratively finding all the remaining tight constraints, our method requires finding only 6 other constraints to form the representative tight set by solving problem REP (the third row in Table 2). With this representative set, we solve FBOS2 to obtain an improved optimal solution. First, we obtain

                        . Each row shows the average of these computation statistics over K games for each combination of (n, ρ, f). For example, the second row shows all the statistics for games with 25 players; the weight vector is from 
                           
                              χ

                         and the winning fraction is 50 percent while the last row is for games with 100 players; the weight vector is from 
                           
                              χ

                              2
                           
                         and the winning fraction is 75 percent.

From the third column, we can observe that the total computation time increase with the number of players. The longest computational time is 238.39 seconds for the largest games with 100 players. Most of the time is taken up for solving the

                         while the total times to find the representative set (REP) and to find improved imputation (FBOS2) are small (note that we have used FBOS2 instead of FBOS because of the exponentially large tight sets). Column 10 shows that these voting games require solving only

                                 ^

                        . All these LPs require less than 500 iterations in the constraint generation algorithm to find an optimal solution. This means that instead of having to solve a big LP with 2
                           n
                         constraints, the CG algorithm solves less than 500 small relaxed LPs and 500 constraint generation problems. The small numbers of iterations used is in fact aligns with the results in Reijnierse and Potters (1998) where the authors show that there exists a set of 
                           
                              2

                              1

                         coalitions that determines the nucleolus of an n-players game. Columns 8 and 9 show that the computation times required to solve these relaxed LPs and the CG problems are relatively small. All the numerical results are tested on a personal computer with 2.67 gigahertz CPU, 12 gigabyte RAM, and the Windows 7, 64-bit operating system. We use MATLAB for coding and use IBM CPLEX Studio Academic version 12.4 for solving LPs and MILP problems under default settings.

Overall, the total computational time increases as the number of players increase (the total time variation by changing other parameters are mixed). The total time is broken down into three main tasks for solving the LPs, finding the representative set and for finding solution with the minimal tight set.

This ranges from solving a single LP to up to 8 LPs. Among all the 300 instances generated, the worst instance with the maximum total time is under 30 minutes.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We presented a nested LPs formulation to compute the nucleolus of large cooperative games. Our methodology was based on two main innovative ideas. First, we provided a method to find an imputation with a smaller tight set from any given imputation by solving a small LP. This allowed us to find an optimal imputation with the smallest tight set, an operation that is crucial in finding the nucleolus. Second, we used representative sets of tight coalitions to deal with situations when the tight set is exponentially large. In addition, we used various techniques such as generating cuts to find multiple coalitions with the same worst excess values and using randomization to improve the computational performance. All of these ideas were developed in conjunction with the constraint generation framework that was used to solve large LPs which means issues such as dealing with multiple optimal solutions and finding the tight sets became more challenging. We demonstrated our algorithm with the general flow games, the coalitional skill games and the weighted voting games. In the coalitional skill games, the nucleoli are found in less than 30 minutes for games with up to 75 players. In the weighted voting game, the nucleoli were found in less than 240 seconds on average even for games with up to 100 players. This is a significant improvement compared to existing methods in the literature where only games with at most 20 players have been studied. Our paper sheds light on future development in the following areas. On the methodology side, the ideas of finding an imputation with smallest tight set and of using representative sets can lead to future studies on solving more general lexicographical minimization problems. In addition, as finding the core and the least core is just one small stage in finding the nucleolus, the constraint generation framework can be further studied to compute these solution concepts for more generic cooperative games. On the practical side, we expect that applications of cooperative game theory that once were hindered by the difficulty in computing the nucleolus could now be possible by applying our results.
