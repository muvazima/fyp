                  We consider the problem of matching capacity and demand in build-to-order manufacturing. Our objective is to assess the ability of upgrade auctions to efficiently allocate excess option capacity to customer orders. We model the Stackelberg game of one manufacturer and a set of loss-averse customers. The manufacturers’ decision of extending the existing fixed-price channel by applying upgrade auctions is evaluated in terms of contribution margin and planning reliability. When the manufacturer offers an option in the upgrade auction, customers seek to maximize utility by buying the option instantly at the fixed price or leaving a bid in hope of a better auction price. Their optimal participation and bidding strategy is explained by a gain-loss utility model with two-dimensional preferences and expectation-based reference levels. Due to missing information on capacity and bids, customers’ decisions are based on estimations of auction and winning probability. We conclude that applying upgrade auctions can significantly improve contribution margin while maintaining planning reliability. Particularly, loss aversion prevents potential fixed-price buyers from bidding in the auction. The results suggest that further effort of implementing upgrade auctions in build-to-order manufacturing will likely pay off.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

We consider the problem of matching capacity and demand in build-to-order (BTO) manufacturing. BTO is an order fulfillment strategy that enables mass customization. Products are customized by adding predefined product features (called options) to a base model (Da Silveira, Borenstein, & Fogliatto, 2001). Examples can be found in the personal computer and the automotive industry (Gunasekaran & Ngai, 2005). Most of the research on matching capacity and demand in BTO manufacturing has been devoted to the aggregate production volume (Volling, Matzke, Grunewald, & Spengler, 2013). What has widely been neglected in the literature is the matching of capacity and demand at the level of product options. This is rather surprising, given that both, the feasibility and the efficiency of procurement and manufacturing operations are strongly linked to option demand (Boysen, Fliedner, & Scholl, 2009).

One way to better align capacity and demand of product options is to upgrade customer orders in case of excess inventory or assembly capacity (jointly called capacity in the following). Excess capacity occurs when flexibility instruments do not fully cope with demand fluctuations. Reasons could be that firms systematically over-dimension capacity to realize short lead times and reduce lost sales or that random swings in option demand realize on very short notice. Demand management techniques can in such situations be helpful in effectively complementing supply-side flexibility instruments (Waller, 2004). A promising instrument for managing excess capacity for product options is upgrades. The general idea is to either add options to existing orders or to change order configurations from a lower priced option to a higher priced alternative (Shumsky & Zhang, 2009). Ervolina, Ettl, Lee, and Peters (2009) report that integrating upgrades, downgrades und flexible products into a configuration recommender system contributed impressively to saving inventory costs in IBMs server supply chain. In a similar setting, Shimoda, Kosugi, Karino, and Komoda (2010) highlight the idea of clearing excess inventory of components by using configuration flexibility of the customer specification. But the benefits of upgrades for BTO manufacturers are not limited to improved operations and increased sales quantities. Furthermore, upsells can improve profits by segmenting customers and discriminating prices (Gallego & Stefanescu, 2012; In & Wright, 2014).

In this paper we consider upgrade auctions for upselling BTO products. Our idea is to complement a fixed-price channel, which is currently used by most BTO manufacturers. Following a phase of regular sales, excess option capacity is auctioned off among all customers who did not yet select the option. In this sense, upgrade auctions are a specific type of capacity auctions (e.g., Hall & Liu, 2013; Karabatı & Yalçin, 2014). From a customer's view, upgrade auctions allow for either buying an option without risk at the fixed price or leaving a bid in order to win the option at a lower price. The downside of bidding is the risk of not getting the option due to high fixed-price sales or higher competing bids. Applications of upgrade auctions have recently been introduced by airlines that are starting to auction free business- or first-class seats to holders of lower-class tickets of the same flight (Elowitt, 2012). We extend the scope of upgrade auctions by analyzing their benefits in a BTO environment.

The profitability and supply-chain efficiency of BTO manufacturing with upgrade auctions are subject to several customer and manufacturer characteristics. We motivate our focus on (i) customer loss aversion and (ii) manufacturer planning reliability in the following.

                           
                              (i)
                              The first essential question of assessing upgrade auctions is whether profits can be increased when compared to the predominant fixed-price mechanism. The simple answer in the face of rational and strategic customers is that the manufacturer has no advantage as customers will exploit their additional degree of freedom for maximizing consumption utility (see Shunda (2009) for a similar discussion in the context of buy-price auctions). However, customizing an individual product is a very emotional process for customers (e.g., Bendapudi & Leone, 2003; Franke, Schreier, & Kaiser, 2010). The more intense the consideration of a particular product option, the higher the customer's engagement with this feature (Carmon, Wertenbroch, & Zeelenberg, 2003). This is why products will be sold with better configurations when starting with a full configuration rather than a base model (Herrmann, Hildebrand, Sprott, & Spangenberg, 2013; Park, Jun, & MacInnis, 2000) and why framing high-level options as the default choice can be used by sellers to systematically increase the sales quantity (Herrmann et al., 2011). A well-developed framework for explaining customer behavior in general (Bendoly, Croson, Goncalves, & Schultz, 2010; Fudenberg, 2006; Ho, Lim, & Camerer, 2006) and in the context of option framing (Biswas & Grau, 2008) is prospect theory (Barberis, 2013; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1991). Similar to option framing, the setting considered in this paper allows customers to select an option at the fixed-price by default or to accept the risk of ending without the option, i.e. with a lower-equipped product. While there certainly are alternative ways of modeling customer preferences, we will build on the existing evidence on prospect theory and option framing when assessing the consequences of introducing upgrade auctions for customer behavior and manufacturer profits.

The second essential question of assessing upgrade auctions is whether upstream supply-chain efficiency can be improved. While flexible allocation and late upgrading are generally beneficial for capacity utilization and revenue (e.g., Shumsky & Zhang, 2009), there potentially are some disadvantages for the upstream supply-chain, if product configurations are changed on short notice. Most firms that apply upgrading rely on very simple product and supply chain architectures. Examples can for instance be found in the service and computer industry (e.g., Shumsky & Zhang, 2009; Steinhardt & Gönsch, 2012). Upgrade auctions are, however, also attractive for BTO industries that have much more complex product architectures and procurement networks in place. Part requirements are in such settings no longer linked to single product options but to the combination of multiple options. Examples can be found in the automotive and furniture industry. For instance, a car's battery and generator type depend on the number of optional electrical systems like seat heating, electrical sunroof and air conditioning (e.g., Gebhardt, Rugheimer, Detmer, & Kruse, 2004). As a result, upgrading the configuration of a product might induce short-term variations of parts demand into the supply chain, a well-known source of inefficiency (Chen, Drezner, Ryan, & Simchi-Levi, 2000). The larger the share of auction sales, the larger the short-term swings in demand and the lower planning reliability. As the dissemination of upgrade auctions in such industries as the automotive industry will heavily rely on the persistent reliability of advance part demand information, we complement our analysis by considering their impact on planning reliability.

Taking customer loss aversion and planning reliability into account, the objective of this paper is to analyze the potentials of upgrade auctions for matching capacity and demand of options in BTO manufacturing.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

To the best of our knowledge, upgrade auctions have not been considered in the academic literature, yet. However, extensive literature has been published on (i) upgrades and (ii) auctions to assess their benefits from a seller's perspective.

                           
                              (i)
                              The application of upgrades and upsells and the more general concepts of product substitution and flexible products have motivated research in different areas. Scholars have investigated the advantages of upgrades in airline overbooking (Alstrup, Boas, Madsen, & Vidal, 1986), multiproduct inventory management (Bassok, Anupindi, & Akella, 1999), car rental und hospitality services (e.g. Karaesmen & van Ryzin, 2004; Netessine, Dobson, & Shumsky, 2002), network capacity control (Steinhardt & Gönsch, 2012), and also BTO manufacturing (Shumsky & Zhang, 2009). In all cases, customers are assumed to be myopic. Customers can therefore be segmented effectively such that the sales quantity, total profit and capacity utilization increase. Upselling techniques further facilitate price discrimination and profit improvements. Gallego and Stefanescu (2012) consider upselling to myopic customers with fixed prices and with pricing flexibility. Considering loss-averse customers in upselling, Rosato, 2013a, 2013b) shows that under specific conditions, myopic customers will pay higher prices than their original willingness to pay. Our paper extends the literature on upgrades and upsells by considering auctions as a new pricing mechanism for upselling. We incorporate reference-dependent preferences, loss aversion and strategic behavior into the analysis of customer choice and manufacturer's profits and provide some further insights into supply-chain efficiency from evaluating planning reliability.

The extensive economic theory on auctions has among others been reviewed by Klemperer (1999); McAfee and McMillan (1987), Milgrom (1989; 2008) and Krishna (2010). Closest to our paper are works considering reference-dependent preferences and loss aversion. These works are mainly driven by empirically assessed anomalies from rational bidding behavior (for a literature review see Kagel, 1995; Kagel & Levin, 2014). Many of the empirical results can be explained when applying prospect theory. Based on the model of Köszegi and Rabin (2006; 2007), Lange and Ratan (2010) replicate empirical findings on first-price and second-price sealed-bid auctions and show that the definition of multidimensional preferences (“narrow bracketing”) is a strong prerequisite of transferring experimental findings into practice.

The proliferation of online auctions has motivated scholars to examine the consequences of hybrid fixed-price and auction sales (Baker & Song, 2007). Amongst the most popular mechanisms are buy-price online auctions (e.g., Budish & Takeyama, 2001; Gallien & Gupta, 2007; Hidvégi, Wang, & Whinston, 2006; Inami, 2011; Shunda, 2009; Sun, Li, & Hayya, 2010; Zhong, 2010) and dual sales channels combining posted prices and online auctions (e.g., Caldentey & Vulcano, 2007; Etzion, Edieal, & Seidmann, 2006; Sun, 2008). Although pure auction mechanisms are generally preferable to other mechanisms, these works show that discounting, risk aversion, transaction costs, as well as competition and bidders with multiunit-demand can make buy-price auctions a better choice (Shunda, 2009). Closest to our work, Caldentey and Vulcano (2007) consider online auctions with shared, limited supply and show that when either customers or the seller discount future payoffs, dual sales channels dominate pure fixed-price or auction channels. In the same line of research, Sun (2008) incorporates supply-chain efficiency in terms of inventory and ordering costs. While most of the works on fixed-price and auction sales implicitly assume that bids are independent of first-stage fixed-prices, this has been challenged by empirical findings suggesting that higher buy-prices stimulate higher bids (e.g., Dodonova & Khoroshilov, 2004; Popkowski Leszczyc, Qiu, & He, 2009). Referring to prospect theory, Shunda (2009) shows that a possible explanation for this phenomenon is the perception of the buy price as a reference price for the optimal bid. In modeling upgrade auctions we adapt this idea and extend it with respect to the notion of recent expectations and multidimensional preferences (Köszegi & Rabin, 2006). The result is a model where only those customers who expect to buy the option at the fixed price will also take the respective payment as a reference level and where different preferences exist with respect to option quality and money consumption.

To summarize, our work contributes to the existing literature in at least three ways. First, it extends the research on upselling and hybrid fixed-price and auction mechanisms by introducing upgrade auctions as a new instrument for service and manufacturing industries. Second, following the prerequisites of BTO manufacturing, expectation-based reference levels and loss aversion are modeled to explain strategic customer behavior and manufacturer benefits. Third, we assess planning reliability to control for consequences on upstream supply-chain planning in settings where parts demand depends on option combinations.

The remaining of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the setting, problem statement and approach, as well as the customers’ gain-loss utility model in upgrade auctions. In Section 3, we analyze the optimal behavior of loss-averse customers and show in Section 4, how this impacts the manufacturer's performance. In Section 5, we discuss the results, their implications for manufacturers and possible extensions for future research. All proofs and a list of symbols are given in the Online Appendix.

We consider a rational, monopolistic manufacturer selling a configurable product with various options to N ≥ 2 symmetric customers that exhibit loss aversion in option choice. We assume that the demand of each option is independent from other options and that there are no technical restrictions on option combinations. We can therefore w.l.o.g. focus on a single option. The overall problem is a single-period Stackelberg game where the optimal manufacturer decision depends on the anticipated customer behavior.

The manufacturer produces N ≥ 2 units of the base product. The product can be customized at order placement by selecting the option. This will increase the product's price by the option's fixed price FP. The option's installation rate is restricted by the capacity K ≤ N. The manufacturer problem is to decide if the option should be available in an upgrade auction, which takes place in case of excess capacity. If an upgrade auction is offered, customers can leave bids for the option instead of buying it at the fixed price. The model captures different settings with respect to the timing of customers’ bids. Either bids are collected during order placement by offering conditional upgrades, or upgrades are offered when all orders and capacity utilization are known. We consider multi-unit discriminatory auctions with single-unit demand (Harris & Raviv, 1981; Vickrey, 1962). Accordingly, customers with the highest bids win the auction and pay their respective bids. The manufacturer's objective is to maximize expected contribution margin E(CM) while maintaining planning reliability. Since planning reliability deteriorates with a decreasing fraction of early fixed configurations, it is discussed by referring to the expected fixed-price sales E(NFP
                        ) in the following. The unit contribution margin is the difference between marginal revenue and marginal costs; the former is given by the winning bids and the latter is given by the variable costs of the option. The variable costs and the manufacturer's reservation price RP are w.l.o.g. set to 0.

We assume stationary demand in a one-periodic model. Customer requests arrive sequentially. Each customer demands one unit of the option with private valuation

                              a

                        ) and auction participation (

                        ). The customers’ objective is to maximize their expected utility U. Expected utility is a function of the participation decision a, the bid b and the valuation v. Furthermore, customer utility depends on the underlying preferences, in particular on the customers’ degree of loss aversion λ as specified in Section 2.2. With uF

The manufacturer has full information except for customers’ private valuations. In contrast, customers have limited information, as they cannot directly observe current capacity utilization and other customers’ bids, as well as its determinants K, N and FV
                        . However, BTO manufacturers usually provide information on the availability of critical options during order promising and historical data on prices and option availability might be publicly accessible. Instead of making additional assumptions on how customers obtain and process this information, we follow a parsimonious approach of assuming that customers share the same belief of two exogenous probabilities, i.e. expected auction probability

                         and expected bid-dependent winning probability

                        . To obtain closed-form results, we further assume that these probabilities are assessed independently. Of course, customers could learn the true probabilities when upgrade auctions are introduced in the long run and adapt their expectations accordingly (Fudenberg, 2006), e.g. when there is a high activity of spreading auction results in social networks. While not discussed here, a valuable extension of our model is to analyze the dynamics of learning and to compare the results with customer behavior under limited and full information.

Convex functions describe rather pessimistic customers who assume that only relatively high bids result in high winning probabilities. Concave functions describe rather optimistic customers who expect a high winning probability, even if the bid is low. The parameters π and ω can be interpreted as the degree of customer pessimism and customer optimism, respectively.

                        . The customer model is solved recursively.

Our customer utility model is based on the gain-loss utility model of prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) and adapts modifications with respect to multidimensional preferences, the definition of expectation-based reference levels and a linear utility function (Köszegi & Rabin, 2006, 2007). We define customer utility u( · ) as the sum of gains and losses in the option's (i) money and (ii) quality dimension. The money dimension corresponds to the customer's option-specific net budget, i.e. the difference of the customer's intrinsic valuation of the option and the money spent. The quality dimension corresponds to the sensation that derives from consuming the option as a part of the final configuration. u( · ) is additively separable in both dimensions, positive and linear for gains, and negative and linear for losses. To incorporate loss-aversion, we apply a weighting factor λ (λ ≥ 1) to losses in option quality. For 
                           
                              λ
                              =
                              1
                           
                         customers are neutral to gains and losses. For λ > 1 losses are valued stronger than gains. Customers are neutral to losses in the money dimension, according to the role of money as an exchange good (Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1990; Novemsky & Kahneman, 2005; Svirsky, 2014).

A customer's loss or gain is based on the comparison of the consumption level

Computing the gain-loss utility requires the definition of all reference and consumption levels. The reference levels are assumed to be exogenously given by the customer's recent expectations (Köszegi & Rabin, 2006; Shunda, 2009). A customer will only expect to buy an option when his valuation is above the fixed price. In a risky environment such as upgrade auctions this reference level can also be interpreted as the customer's riskless default action. Accordingly, we distinguish two types of customers. Low-valuation customers exhibit a valuation below the fixed price (v < FP). The option will therefore not be included in their expected product configuration, and the budget is expected to remain constant, i.e. 
                           
                              
                                 r
                                 
                                    l
                                    o
                                    w
                                 
                              
                              =
                              
                                 (
                                 v
                                 ,
                                 0
                                 )
                              
                           
                        . High-valuation customers, in contrast, have a valuation above the fixed price (v ≥ FP) and will therefore by default include the option into their expected product configuration, paying FP. Their reference level therefore is

The consumption levels are equally defined for low-valuation and high-valuation customers. When buying at the fixed price, a customer pays FP and receives the option, i.e. the consumption level is

                        . When participating in the upgrade auction, a customer has to consider two possible consumption levels. When winning the auction, he has to pay the bid and receives the option, i.e.

In the following, we solve the utility-maximization problem of low-valuation and high-valuation customers. Both problems are divided into two subproblems that are solved sequentially. We first determine the optimal bidding strategy in case of auction participation. Given this, we determine the optimal participation strategy.

We show that low-valuation customers always participate in the auction and underbid depending on their pessimism or optimism when estimating the bid-dependent winning probability.

A low-valuation customer's net utility of buying the option at the fixed price follows from (2) with

Since  1/π > 0, the right-hand side (RHS) of (4) is always smaller than v. Proposition 1 therefore indicates that low-valuation customers underbid. The degree of underbidding only depends on customer pessimism. Very pessimistic customers with π → ∞ believe that only high bids win and thus the optimal bid approaches v. In contrast, very optimistic customers with

                         will bid 0. The intuition behind underbidding is that low-valuation customers compare the utility of unexpectedly receiving the option with the disutility of spending more money than expected.

The low-valuation customers’ optimal participation strategy is straightforward. On the one hand, we showed that fixed-price purchase will always result in negative customer utility. On the other hand, considering (3) and the fact that customers underbid, auction participation will always result in non-negative customer utility. The optimal participation strategy thus is

We show that high-valuation customers underbid depending on loss aversion and buy at the fixed price if their valuation is higher than a threshold that depends on their loss aversion and winning expectations.

The definition of the high-valuation customer's utility is similar to the low-valuation customer case. Following (2) with

This utility function displays the trade-off concerning the customers’ bid. The first part stands for the expected rebate on the fixed price when winning the auction and the second part stands for the expected loss of product quality mitigated by the amount of money saved. While a higher bid adds weight to the first part of (6), it simultaneously reduces the potential rebate and decreases the weight of the second part. Obviously, as higher a customer's valuation is, as higher is the potential loss. The utility-maximizing bidding strategy of a high-valuation customer solves the bidder's trade-off as stated by the following proposition.

                        Proposition 2 indicates that high-valuation customers also underbid and bids are below FP. If a customer is not loss-averse (
                           
                              λ
                              =
                              1
                           
                        ), the bidding strategy (7) is equal to that of low-valuation customers (4). When customers are loss-averse (λ > 1), the optimal bid increases, i.e. high-valuation customers always bid a higher share of their valuation compared to low-valuation customers. This is because high-valuation customers’ disutility of possibly losing the option mitigates underbidding. Furthermore, underbidding is not driven by the loss of money but by the potential rebate on FP.

Underbidding is consistent with the results of Lange and Ratan (2010) who consider first-price sealed-bid auctions and stochastic reference levels and assume that customers are loss-averse in product consumption. In addition, the differentiated bidding behavior with respect to the customers' reference level fits with the effect of reference levels studied by Shunda (2009).

We next derive the participation strategy of high-valuation customers.

The intuition behind the threshold participation strategy is that a higher valuation goes along with a higher disutility of losing the auction. Since the utility of fixed-price purchase is 0 for all high-valuation customers, the threshold value is the valuation above that the expected auction utility is negative. Furthermore, when loss aversion of all high-valuation customers is above a critical value, all of them will prefer the fixed-price purchase. This type of customer behavior is typical for hybrid fixed-price and auction sales (Shunda, 2009) and has been found by Caldentey and Vulcano (2007) for time-sensitive customers in a similar setting.

                        Lemma 1 indicates that criteria for dominance of fixed-price purchase can be obtained for different parameters. First, the dominance of buying at FP on bidding above FP can be translated into minimal values for λ and π. Second, minimal (maximal) values for λ and π (

                         according to (9). One implication of these critical values is that they mitigate the influence of heterogeneous customer parameters on the manufacturer's results. As long as parameters are above these values (below in case of

The concept of a minimal (maximal) value for preferred customer behavior compares to the normative regret threshold that characterizes advance purchase settings in Nasiry and Popescu (2012).

In this section, we explore the performance of upgrade auctions. For this, we first model the relative change in contribution margin and fixed-price sales from introducing upgrade auctions, then assess the lower and upper bounds of these values and finally discuss their dependence of customers’ loss aversion and winning expectations.

In this subsection, we narrow down the opportunities and risks of adopting upgrade auctions by deriving structural results on the relative changes of expected fixed-price sales and expected contribution margin.

In the most general setting, i.e. without any assumptions on the fixed-price, capacity and customer parameters, lower and upper bounds can take extreme values. In the dual channel, all high-valuation customers might buy at the fixed price (

                         is obtained when the pure fixed-price channel does not generate any profit as opposed to the hybrid channel. Although being of limited practical value, these results underpin the relevance of understanding upgrade auctions and show that the (mis-) management of the fixed-price channel strongly affects the auction's benefits.

For obtaining more relevant results we make three assumptions. (i) The fixed-price will be set up to maximize expected contribution margin and capacity to fulfill expected fixed-price demand. (ii) These optimal values will persist in the dual channel as the upgrade auction is a supplement to existing fixed-price sales. Gallego and Stefanescu (2012) discuss this assumption and its relaxation in detail. (iii) Customer valuations are uniformly distributed, while total demand, loss-aversion and customers’ expected auction and winning probabilities have arbitrary values. Under these assumptions, Lemma 2 states the upper and lower bounds of the relative changes of fixed-price sales and the manufacturer's contribution margin.

                        Lemma 2 indicates that the performance of upgrade auctions differs widely, depending on the particular industry situation. In the worst case, the manufacturer's contribution margin and planning reliability fully deteriorate. This happens if all high-valuation customers participate in the auction and all bids approach 0. In the best case, planning reliability can be fully preserved. Furthermore, contribution margin can increase up to 28 percent as compared to the pure fixed-price setting. This value is reached when 
                           
                              N
                              =

                         and decreases with increasing N.

                         does not correspond to the central first-best solution. In contrast, we presuppose that fixed-price purchase is always maintained and dominates bidding above FP. The difference to the first-best solution can thus be interpreted as the price of maintaining fixed-price sales or, more narrowly, as the price of planning reliability in BTO manufacturing. In many settings, the potential of upgrade auctions might be larger than the values reported here. The assumption of balanced capacity is rather conservative for industrial BTO settings. Particularly, if contribution margins and the importance of availability are high, firms tend to over-dimension capacity (

                        ). In these settings, the upper bound strongly increases as long as customers’ winning expectations remain unchanged.

                         yields an upper bound of expected improvement rate of 2.8 percent and 
                           
                              N

                              2000
                           
                         yields a value of 0.9 percent. The underlying reason is that the relative variance of binomial-distributed fixed-price demand is decreasing in N. Likewise the expected relative excess capacity compared to K decreases.


                        Lemma 2 shows that the largest threat to manufacturers implementing upgrade auctions is the risk of losing contribution margin and planning reliability due to strategic customer behavior. On the one hand they might try to mitigate this risk by setting the reservation price RP to RP > 0. On the other hand, this would prevent some low-valuation customers from bidding and thus counteract the positive effect of upgrade auctions. To tackle this issue, it is thus very important to assess customer expectations and behavior and to only implement upgrade auctions when the prerequisites of the desired customer behavior are fulfilled. In the following section, we identify desirable customer properties by assessing the influence of customer loss aversion and winning expectations on the performance of upgrade auctions.

We show that contribution margin of applying upgrade auctions and fixed-price sales are increasing in customer loss aversion and decreasing in customers’ winning expectations, and are maximal above (below) critical values of customer parameters.

Following Proposition 3, a high degree of loss aversion in option choice will motivate high-valuation customers to buy at FP. In contrast, optimistic estimations of auction and winning probability lead to high auction participation rates and low bids as shown by Propositions 1–3. The following lemmas state the effect of loss aversion and customer expectations on the performance of upgrade auctions. Lemma 3 considers customer loss aversion.

According to Lemma 1, this is the smallest value of loss aversion where fixed-price purchase weakly dominates auction participation. Likewise, Fig. 4(b) shows that fixed-price sales deteriorates unless λ ≥ 1.17. Moreover, ΔE(CM) and ΔE(NFP
                        ) are decreasing in N.

                        ), underbidding of all customers and participation of some high-valuation customers as shown in Examples 2 and 3 reveals a lower contribution margin. Following (11) and (13), the expected additional contribution margin from upgrading a car with a sunroof through an upgrade auction is 0.7 percent, i.e. 7 EUR.

Considering the fact that the additional contribution margin directly increases the profit of the car, the potential has a relevant magnitude. It further increases when multiple options are sold in upgrade auctions. Additionally, in contrast to our assumption of balanced capacity and demand, automobile manufacturers often report systematic overcapacity. Thus, realistic settings might involve substantially higher potentials.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We consider the problem of matching capacity and demand of product options in BTO manufacturing. Upgrade auctions are introduced as a new approach to allocate excess option capacity to upgradable customer orders. We study the potential and conditions of successfully applying upgrade auctions when customers are loss-averse.

For this, we model the manufacturer's expected surplus from applying upgrade auctions by anticipating the optimal behavior of utility-maximizing customers. A two-dimensional gain-loss utility model allows for analyzing the different behavior of low- and high-valuation customers. There are three primary conclusions from this study.

                        
                           •
                           While the manufacturer always benefits from upgrading orders of low-valuation customers, contribution margin and planning reliability deteriorate when strategic high-valuation customers bid in the auction.

The surplus in contribution margin increases and the loss in planning reliability decreases when customers are loss-averse or have pessimistic estimates of auction and winning probability. In particular, when loss aversion or the pessimism in estimating auction and winning probability exceed a critical value, the manufacturer yields the highest surplus in contribution margin while maintaining planning reliability.

The manufacturer's surplus in contribution margin cannot exceed 28 percent in case of stochastic excess capacity and uniformly distributed valuations. The surplus decreases with increasing total demand. Numerical examples aligned to realistic settings still exhibit substantial improvement rates.

The results provide three main insights for BTO manufacturers. First, while BTO manufacturers, e.g. in the automotive industry, have been reluctant to innovate their sales channels, our analysis shows that upgrade auctions can be a starting point as they supply substantial potential of improving contribution margin and capacity utilization without radically changing existing sales channels. Second, manufacturers should only offer upgrade auctions to customers that cannot buy the option at the fixed price or prevent strategic behavior by emphasizing potential losses over gains. This can e.g. be achieved with subtractive option framing (Biswas & Grau, 2008) and scarcity marketing (Balachander, Liu, & Stock, 2009). Finally, manufacturers applying our results can improve their success rates by focusing on options or customer segments with inherently high levels of loss aversion and pessimistic estimates of auction and winning probabilities.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first discussing upgrade auctions. Our results are based on several assumptions that are aligned to the setting of BTO manufacturing and provide many opportunities for future research.

Concerning the manufacturer model, we assume exogenously given prices and capacity and therefore provide a conservative assessment of the hybrid sales mechanism. Integrated optimization of fixed-prices, capacity and auction parameters will tap the full potential of the approach. This will require to extend the manufacturer model significantly. Furthermore, we propose a customer gain-loss utility model including specific expectation-based reference levels. Should first applications of upgrade auctions reveal that customers adapt their expectations, e.g. due to learning, one could easily extend the customer model by following the framework of Köszegi and Rabin (2006). In addition, customers in the considered setting have no information on capacity and demand. While this is quite typical for BTO environments such as the automotive industry, it would be interesting to extend the analysis to capture more transparent markets like in the airline or hotel industry. This would additionally allow for analyzing the impact of biased auction and winning probability estimations.

Furthermore, restricting the analysis to a single option requires independent option demand. In order to better understand the potential of upgrade auctions in general settings, it would be interesting to integrate the models and findings on multivariate customer choice and combinatorial auctions (e.g., Karabatı & Yalçin, 2014; Xia, Koehler, & Whinston, 2004). Finally, we assume that the sales channel consists of one rational manufacturer. In reality, heterogeneous decision makers in a multi-level distribution hierarchy, as well as retailer orders might affect the results. Hence, the implications of upgrade auctions on channel coordination (e.g., Li & Wang, 2007) and the effect of behavioral manufacturers or retailers (e.g., Wang & Webster, 2007) are promising fields of future research.
