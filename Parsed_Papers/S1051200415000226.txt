                  The goal of this paper is to design a statistical test for the camera model identification problem from JPEG images. The approach focuses on extracting information in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain. The main motivation is that the statistics of DCT coefficients change with different sensor noises combining with various in-camera processing algorithms. To accurately capture this information, this paper relies on the state-of-the-art model of DCT coefficients proposed in our previous work. The DCT coefficient model is characterized by two parameters 
                        (
                        α
                        ,
                        β
                        )
                     . The parameters 
                        (
                        c
                        ,
                        d
                        )
                      that characterize the simplified relation between these parameters are exploited as camera fingerprint for camera model identification. The camera model identification problem is cast in the framework of hypothesis testing theory. In an ideal context where all model parameters are perfectly known, the Likelihood Ratio Test is presented and its performances are theoretically established. For a practical use, two Generalized Likelihood Ratio Tests are designed to deal with unknown model parameters such that they can meet a prescribed false alarm probability while ensuring a high detection performance. Numerical results on simulated and real JPEG images highlight the relevance of the proposed approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The evolution of digital imaging technology and information technologies in the past decades has raised a number of information security challenges. Digital images can be easily edited, altered or falsified because of a large availability of low-cost image editing tools. Consequently, the credibility and trustworthiness of digital images have been eroded. Digital image forensics has emerged in response to the increasing need to verify the trustworthiness of digital images, see [1] and references therein for detailed introductions.

One of the key problems of digital image forensics is identification of image origin, which aims to verify whether a given image was acquired by a specific camera and to determine camera models/brands as well as types of imaging mechanism (e.g. scanners, cell-phone cameras, or computer graphics). Basically, when an image is captured by a camera, it is stored with the metadata headers in the memory storage device, e.g. Exchangeable Image File (EXIF) and JPEG headers. Therefore, the simplest way to determine the source of the image is to read out directly from the metadata. However, such metadata headers are not always available in practice if the image is resaved in a different format or recompressed. Another problem is that the metadata headers are not reliable as they can be easily removed or modified using low-cost editing tools. Therefore, it is desirable for law enforcement agencies to build a set of reliable forensic tools for image origin identification.

In general, there are two approaches to address the problem of image origin identification. Active forensics involves generating security measures such as digital watermarks [2] and digital signatures [3], referred to as extrinsic fingerprints, and adding to the image file. However, active forensics is of limited extent due to many strict constraints in its protocols. In order to solve the problem of image origin identification in its entirety, passive forensics evolved. In contrast to active forensics, passive forensics do not impose any constraint, nor require any prior information. Forensic analysts have only the suspect image at their disposal and must explore useful information from that image to gather forensic evidence and trace the acquisition device. The common philosophy in passive approach is to rely on inherent intrinsic fingerprints that the digital camera leaves in a given image. Passive forensics can be widely applied to millions of images that circulate daily on communication networks.

This paper mainly addresses the identification origin of images acquired by digital cameras based on the passive approach. Technically, any method proposed for image origin identification must respond to the following questions:
                           
                              1.
                              Which fingerprints are utilized for identification?

How to extract these fingerprints accurately from a given image?

Under which frameworks is the method designed to exploit the discriminability of fingerprints extracted from images captured by different sources
                                    2
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                    The term source refers to an individual camera instance, a camera model, or a camera brand.
                                  and to calculate the similarity of fingerprints extracted from images captured by the same source?

In image origin identification problem, it is important to distinguish the problem of camera instance identification and the problem of camera model/brand identification. More specifically, fingerprints used for camera instance identification should capture individuality, especially cameras coming from the same brand and model. For camera model/brand identification, it is necessary to exploit fingerprints that are shared between cameras of the same model/brand but discriminative for different camera models/brands. Passive forensic methods proposed for those problems can be divided into two fundamental categories.

Several fingerprints have been proposed in the literature. Sensor Pattern Noise (SPN), which is caused by imperfections during the manufacturing process and non-uniformity of photo-electronic conversion due to inhomogeneity of silicon wafers, is used in [4] for camera instance identification. Two main components of the SPN are the Fixed Pattern Noise (FPN) and the Photo-Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) noise. The FPN is also used for camera instance identification in [5]. However it can be compensated by subtracting a dark frame from the output image, thus it is not a robust fingerprint and no longer used in recent works. The PRNU is directly exploited in [6–8]. Moreover, PRNU can be also used for camera model identification as proposed in [9] based on the assumption that the fingerprint obtained from images in the TIFF or JPEG format contains traces of post-acquisition processes (e.g. demosaicing) that carry information about the camera model. Other fingerprints include lens aberration [10], Color Filter Array (CFA) pattern and interpolation algorithms [11–14], JPEG compression [15], or collection of features [16–18], which are proposed for camera model/brand identification.

In general, the image origin identification problem can be formulated into two frameworks: supervised classification [19] and hypothesis testing [20]. Compared with hypothesis testing framework, supervised classification framework is utilized by most existing methods in the literature to identify camera brands/models. Based on the above fingerprint, a forensic feature set is designed and employed in a machine learning algorithm, e.g. Support Vector Machines (SVM) [21]. Supervised classification framework involves three main drawbacks. To achieve high accuracy, this framework requires an expensive training stage that comprises many images with different characteristics (e.g. image content or camera settings) from various sources to represent a real-world situation, which might be unrealistic in practice. Another drawback is the choice of an appropriate forensic feature, which affects the detection performance of the classifier. Besides, the analytic establishment of statistical performances still remains an open problem in supervised classification framework [22].

Even though these methods perform efficiently, they have been designed with a very limited exploitation of hypothesis testing theory and statistical image models. Therefore, their performance cannot be analytically established and is only evaluated based on a large image database. Moreover, in the operational context, it is crucial to warrant a prescribed false alarm probability. Our previous work [23] proposed the design of a statistical test within hypothesis testing framework based on the heteroscedastic noise model for camera model identification from RAW images. Recently, this work has been extended in [24] for camera model identification from JPEG images based on the generalized noise model [25]. The proposed tests can guarantee a false alarm probability while ensuring a high detection performance on a large database.

The present paper addresses the problem of camera model identification from JPEG images. More specifically, this paper is based on the hypothesis testing theory, which is the same methodology proposed in our previous research papers [23,24,26]. The main difference between the approaches proposed in this paper and in our previous research papers [23,24] is that the previous research papers focus on noise statistics in the spatial domain while the present paper extracts this information in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain. More specifically, the approach proposed in [23] relies on the heteroscedastic noise model (1) for camera model identification from RAW images. However, the RAW format is not always available in practice. Since most cameras nowadays export images in JPEG format, it is desirable to identify camera models from JPEG images. Another approach proposed in [24] is based on the generalized noise model (2) provided in [25]. By contrast, the present paper works in the DCT domain. The main motivation is that the statistics of DCT coefficients change with different sensor noises combining with various in-camera processing algorithms. Therefore, this paper exploits a state-of-the-art model of DCT coefficients [29] to accurately extract information at different frequencies and proposes a new fingerprint for camera model identification.

The main contributions are the following:

                              This paper is based on the state-of-the-art statistical model of DCT coefficients [27–29] for fingerprint extraction. The parameters

                                    )
                                  that characterize the simplified linear relation between two parameters α and 
                                    
                                       
                                          β

                                 , which are specified in the proposed model of DCT coefficients, are exploited as camera fingerprint for camera model identification.

Stating the camera model identification problem in hypothesis testing framework, the paper studies the optimal detector given by the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) in an ideal context where all model parameters are known. This optimal detector serves as an upper-boundary of any statistical test for the camera model identification problem.

In the practical context, the model parameters are unknown. The paper proposes two Generalized Likelihood Ratio Tests (GLRTs) to deal with the difficulty of unknown parameters. The statistical performance of the GLRTs is analytically established. Moreover, the proposed GLRTs enable us to guarantee a prescribed false-alarm rate and the setting of decision threshold independently of the image content, which is crucial in an operational context. Numerical experiments also show that the loss of power of GLRTs compared with the LRT is negligible.

The present paper is an extended version of our conference submission [26]. The conference version presents the LRT in the theoretical context and the first GLRT in the practical context dealing with unknown image parameters (i.e. unknown parameter α). This journal version provides more demonstrations such that the linear relation between α and

                           (
                           c

                           )
                         in the practical context (see Section 3). Moreover, the journal version studies a more general scenario where the image parameters and camera parameters are unknown and fully develops the second GLRT for this scenario. More numerical experiments and case of studies are included in the present paper to highlight the relevance of the proposed approach.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the camera fingerprint that is further exploited for camera model identification. Section 3 designs an algorithm for camera fingerprint extraction in the DCT domain. Section 4 states the camera model identification problem in the framework of hypothesis testing theory and studies the LRT assuming that all model parameters are known in advance. Section 5 designs two GLRTs to address the difficulty of unknown parameters. Section 6 presents numerical results of two proposed GLRTs on simulated and real JPEG images. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

To design a camera fingerprint, it is vital to fully understand image characteristics during various stages of image processing pipeline and study image statistics. Image processing pipeline involves several steps from light capturing to image storage performed in a digital camera, see details about image processing pipeline in [30,27,29]. After measuring light intensity at each pixel, the RAW image is recorded by the image sensor. Then it goes through some typical post-acquisition processes, e.g. demosaicing, white-balancing and gamma correction, to render a full-color high-quality output image, referred to as TIFF image. JPEG compression can be also performed for ease of storage and transmission.

The study of noise statistics in a natural image from RAW format to TIFF format was carried out in our previous work [25]. Firstly, the study starts from the heteroscedastic noise model proposed in [23], which is established by modeling various noise sources during RAW image acquisition [31]. The heteroscedastic noise model characterizes the RAW image more accurately than the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) model widely used in image processing since it takes into account the contribution of Poisson noise in the acquisition process. The heteroscedastic noise model is given as

Then, assuming the operations of demosaicing and white-balancing are linear, it is proposed to take into account the non-linear effect of gamma correction to develop a so-called generalized noise model, given as

The next step in image processing pipeline is JPEG compression that involves transforming the TIFF image into the DCT domain. To capture statistics of DCT coefficients accurately, it is necessary to study the model of DCT coefficients. Based on the assumption that the pixels are identically distributed within

                      (see more details in Appendix A). To illustrate the linear relation (4), we conduct an experiment on uniform synthetic images. These images are randomly generated using an original image and the generalized noise model (2) with parameters

                        =
                        2
                     , 
                        γ

                        2.2
                     . The original image is created such that the intensities in each 
                        8
                        ×
                        8
                      block is identical, which aims to ensure the assumption used for the statistical study of DCT coefficients in [29]. Then, those simulated images are transformed into DCT domain. The parameters 
                        (
                        α
                        ,
                        β
                        )
                      at each frequency are estimated. Relation (4) on those simulated images is illustrated in Fig. 1
                     . It should be noted that in such uniform images the energy is located equally at different frequencies. Therefore, the parameters 
                        (
                        α
                        ,
                        β
                        )
                      are identical among different frequencies.

Relation (4) suggests that the parameters 
                        (
                        c
                        ,
                        d
                        )
                      can also be used for camera model identification. It can be noted that while relations (1) and (2) characterize the non-stationarity of noise in the spatial domain, relation (4) characterizes this property in the DCT domain. The relation (4) can capture the difference of noise statistics in natural images taken by different camera models. Moreover, the linearity in relation (4) can facilitate the estimation of the parameters 
                        (
                        c
                        ,
                        d
                        )
                     . Therefore, this paper proposes the exploitation of the parameters 
                        (
                        c
                        ,
                        d
                        )
                      as new fingerprint for camera model identification.

An important requirement when using parameters 
                        (
                        c
                        ,
                        d
                        )
                      as camera fingerprint is that they should be invariant to image content. Furthermore, to guarantee the above mathematical framework, it is necessary to work on homogeneous blocks. These considerations are addressed in this section.

Because of heterogeneity and noise non-stationarity in a natural image, the energy tends to be more located in lower frequencies. Consequently, DCT coefficients at different frequencies do not share the same parameters 
                        (
                        α
                        ,
                        β
                        )
                      and 
                        (
                        c
                        ,
                        d
                        )
                     . Therefore, the estimation of parameters 
                        (
                        α
                        ,
                        β
                        )
                      and 
                        (
                        c
                        ,
                        d
                        )
                      should be performed on each frequency separately. In this paper it is proposed to arrange DCT coefficients into 64 vectors of coefficients according to the zig-zag order. Let

                         consists of three fundamental steps: image denoising, homogeneous block detection, and Least-Squares (LS) estimation [33]. Image denoising step aims to attenuate the impact of image content. The detection of homogeneous blocks is performed subsequently to provide appropriate sample data for parameter estimation. The LS approach is applied straightforwardly as the relation (4) is linear.

Let Z be a two-dimensional matrix representing a natural image. To remove the image content, a denoising filter

For homogeneous block detection, this paper proposes the calculation of the standard deviation of each block and compare it with a threshold λ. The median of absolute deviations (MAD), which is considered as a robust estimator of standard deviation [34], is utilized to calculate the standard deviation of each block. Instead of calculating the standard deviation in the spatial domain where the pixels are correlated, it is proposed in this paper to calculate it in the DCT domain because of the decorrelation property of a DCT operation [35]. Moreover, since DCT is an orthogonal transformation, in an ideal case where the block is homogeneous and the pixels are statistically independent, the standard deviation in the spatial domain should be the same as the one in the DCT domain. The standard deviation of block i in the DCT domain is calculated as

                         remain identical for images with different image contents. However, in practice, due to the fact that the perfect denoising filter 
                           D
                         is difficult to obtain, the DCT coefficients at low frequencies are still affected by image content. Meanwhile, the coefficients at high frequencies contain mostly noises because of the energy compaction property of the DCT operation. Thus they are more relevant to exploit for camera model identification. Fig. 2

                                 I

                        . The approximating function (14) is used only for simplification of the LR. The estimation of parameters

In order to analytically establish the statistical performance of the LRT, it is necessary to characterize the statistical distribution of the LR 
                           Λ
                           (
                           Z
                           )
                         under each hypothesis 
                           
                              
                                 H

                        . To this end, it is proposed to rely on the Lindeberg Central Limit Theorem (CLT) [20, Theorem 11.2.5] that requires the calculation of the expectation and variance of

In this paper, the wavelet-based denoising filter proposed in [38,4] is employed to suppress image content because of its relative accuracy and computational efficiency. Besides, the selection of homogeneous blocks requires an appropriate threshold λ. This threshold should be fixed independently of image content. The threshold λ is set at 
                        λ

                         to facilitate the study, it is desirable to compare the detection performance of the LRT based on the approximated LR with the one based on the exact LR. The expectation and variance of the exact LR are calculated numerically. Moreover, it is necessary to compare the detection performance of the proposed GLRTs with the LRT since the GLRTs utilize ML estimates of unknown parameters, which may cause a loss of power. Fig. 5
                         and Fig. 6
                         show the detection performance of all proposed tests for 1024 and 4096 coefficients, respectively. For clarity, only regions of interest are illustrated in the figures. It is worth noting that the loss of power between the theoretical LRT and approximating LRT is negligible. Besides, a small loss of power is revealed between the GLRTs and LRT due to the estimation of unknown parameters. Nevertheless this loss of power decreases when the number of coefficients increases. It can also be noted that the loss of power between two GLRTs

Experiments are then conducted on a large database to verify the efficiency of the proposed approach. The public Dresden image database [39] is chosen in our experiments. Technical specifications of the cameras are shown in Table 1
                        , see more details in [39]. The database covers different devices per camera model, different imaged scenes, different camera settings and different environmental conditions. All images are acquired with the highest available JPEG quality setting and maximum available resolution. For each camera model, the set contains 50 images per camera model for estimation of reference camera parameters and 100 images per device for testing, which are randomly selected from the Dresden database.

It can be noted from Table 2 that the incorrect detection in some groups of camera models, such as (C,N1,Pe), (F,Ro), and (K,N3), is important. This may be justified due to a similarity in JPEG compression scheme used in the camera.

This paper also presents the SVM-based detector for comparison, which has been already performed in [39] on the Dresden database using 46 different features to capture characteristics of different camera components of a digital camera. The feature set includes three main groups: color features describing the color reproduction of a camera model, wavelet statistics quantifying sensor noise and image quality metrics measuring sharpness and noise. The reader is referred to [40] for more details of this feature set. The detection performance of this SVM-based detector is shown in Table 3
                        . The proposed detector

                         is almost equivalent to the SVM-based detector in terms of average correct detection performance but the misclassification of the former is more severe. The PRNU-based detector [7] is also performed in this experiment. This PRNU-based detector is only conducted on one device per model. Its detection performance is shown in Table 4
                        . Overall, the two proposed detectors provide an equivalent detection performance compared with the other ones in the literature, but the latter cannot guarantee a prescribed false alarm probability like the proposed detectors.


                        
                           Remark 1
                           The present paper proposes exploiting the state-of-the-ar model of DCT coefficients provided in [29]. This model is not only more accurate than prior-art models in the literature, but also is the only one that is mathematically justified based on a statistical analysis of images' properties according to the image processing pipeline, as provided in [29]. Therefore, relying on the proposed model allows us to accurately capture statistics of DCT coefficients as well as to analyze camera fingerprint that can be exploited for camera model identification.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The goal of this paper is to design a statistical test for camera model identification from JPEG images within hypothesis testing framework. The approach is based on the state-of-the-art model of DCT coefficients to capture their statistical difference, which jointly results from different sensor noises and in-camera processing algorithms. The parameters

                        d

                              −
                              1
                           
                        
                     , which are two parameters of the DCT coefficient model, are proposed to be exploited as camera fingerprint for camera model identification. Based on the parametric model of DCT coefficients, this paper studies the most powerful LRT and proposes two GLRTs that can be straightforwardly applied in practice. The strength of the proposed approach is that statistical performance of the tests can be analytically established and can also warrant a prescribed false alarm rate while ensuring a high detection performance.

                      It can be noted that this approximating model is a special case of the GΓ model [42] when 
                        γ
                        =
                        1
                      (the variable γ is given in [42, Eq. (6)]).

It can be noted from (15) that it is necessary to calculate the expectation and variance of the random variable 
                        |
                        I
                        |
                     . Given a constant variance 
                        
                           
                              σ
                           
                           
                              b
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     , the random variable I is normally distributed with zero-mean and variance 
                        
                           
                              σ
                           
                           
                              b

                     . Thus, the random variable 
                        |
                        I
                        |
                      follows the half-Normal distribution [43]. Therefore, we obtain
