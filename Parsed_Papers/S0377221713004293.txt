                  This paper presents a methodology to find near-optimal joint inventory control policies for the real case of a one-warehouse, n-retailer distribution system of infusion solutions at a University Medical Center in France. We consider stochastic demand, batching and order-up-to level policies as well as aspects particular to the healthcare setting such as emergency deliveries, required service level rates and a new constraint on the ordering policy that fits best the hospital’s interests instead of abstract ordering costs. The system is modeled as a Markov chain with an objective to minimize the stock-on-hand value for the overall system. We provide the analytical structure of the model to show that the optimal reorder point of the policy at both echelons is easily derived from a simple probability calculation. We also show that the optimal policy at the care units is to set the order-up-to level one unit higher than the reorder point. We further demonstrate that optimizing the care units in isolation is optimal for the joint multi-echelon, n-retailer problem. A heuristic algorithm is presented to find the near-optimal order-up-to level of the policy of each product at the central pharmacy; all other policy parameters are guaranteed optimal via the structure provided by the model. Comparison of our methodology versus that currently in place at the hospital showed a reduction of approximately 45% in the stock-on-hand value while still respecting the service level requirements.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Healthcare spending has been continuously growing to more than 2.5 trillion USD in the United States in 2009 (CMS, 2011) and up to 234.1 billion euros in France in 2010 (DREES, 2011). Facing the increase of these expenditures, and under pressure from governments, insurance companies and communities, hospital administrators have begun to utilize operations research methodologies to improve service quality and reduce costs (Li & Benton, 1996). Aptel and Pourjalali (2001) provide insight into how hospitals in the US and France have improved their logistic activities and decreased costs.

This article addresses the pharmacy inventory control problem for the supply chain network of hospitals of the University Medical Center in Nantes, France. We consider a one-warehouse, n-retailer inventory system with emergency replenishments and target service level constraints under stochastic demand. The objective is to optimize the inventory policy of the supply chain of infusion solutions including the special constraints and operational differences that the healthcare industry demands.

To be precise, healthcare supply chain models are often service-oriented (Samuel, Gonapa, Chaudhary, & Mishra, 2010) in contrast to traditional approaches which include a penalty or monetary cost in the objective function for the chosen ordering policy. In our problem, imposing a subjective (and potentially biased) cost for ordering would result in suboptimal solutions. Instead, the limited and constant workforce restrains the ordering policy which is a distinguishing feature of this problem.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the current situation of the hospital is described, and in Section 3 a literature review on the topic is made. Section 4 presents the model. Section 5 presents special properties of our model and our near-optimal solution methodology. Results are presented in Section 6 followed by conclusions in Section 7.

For the hospital pharmacy problem, we focus on infusion solutions as they are very common medicine for various treatments. Infusion solutions are also generally non-critical and have long expiration dates. Nevertheless, stockout events imply highly variable costs (some patients might be treated if similar products are available, other patients require specific products and replacement is forbidden. For such cases, stockout might lead to a patient’s death or other serious health consequences). As an alternative of monetizing the stockout costs of medicines, the hospital agrees that imposing a minimum service level constraint is more realistic and emergency deliveries are always available to fulfill the demand as a last resource on stockout events.

In the current situation, the central warehouse (referred to as the CP for Central Pharmacy) of the hospital delivers infusion solutions along with a myriad of other pharmaceutical and medical supplies to the three hospital pharmacy depots (HP) that belong to the hospital’s network. They are then delivered to the corresponding Care Unit (CU) and to other periphery hospitals integrating a three-echelon system. Fig. 1
                      shows the current supply chain in the hospital scheme. The hospital currently handles 74 infusion solution products that are delivered to 250 CUs.

The CP has a periodic review, order-up-to level inventory control policy with batching that is known in the literature as the (nQ, r, T) policy, formally described first by Hadley and Whitin (1963). The review period happens once every T periods (once a week), where pharmacists place an order in multiples of Q (batches), if and only if the inventory position is less than or equal to the re-order point r (denoted as s from now on), to raise inventory to some value S. These values are currently set by “expert knowledge” according to the price and the average weekly demand of the product. There is also a limit on the number of product references that the CP is allowed to order each week due to staff limitations to process all of the orders and the associated paperwork. This constraint does not justify an eventual stockout situation, but if the limit on the number of product references is violated systematically, the payment to suppliers can be delayed. Therefore, what best fits the hospital’s interest is to limit the expected number of product references that the CP orders weekly rather than the “actual” number. Further, suppliers request a fixed-size batch-ordering policy and orders arrive one week after they are placed.

Daily trucks deliver to the HPs from the CP according to fixed schedules to supply the hospitals with clothes, food and medicine. These transportation activities limit the use of vehicles for medicine transportation to once a week, so replenishment has to be coordinated to this schedule. The HPs follow a weekly (R, s, S) policy as defined by Scarf (1959). Every R time units (the review point is performed once a week), pharmacists check the stock-on-hand quantities using automated software and trigger orders to suppliers to take the quantity in stock up to a pre-established value S if there is less than a re-order point s. As with the CP, policy parameters are set by empirical methods with storage capacity and target service level constraints. Once the order is delivered to the HP, it is distributed to the CUs. Every CU also follows an (R, s, S) policy and is replenished weekly. CUs have very limited storage space and cannot generally store more than one week of inventory.

If a stock out happens at any CU, emergency replenishments are made from the HP within a negligible lead time. If the product is not available at the HP, the common strategy is transshipment between CUs in the same facility, but this disturbs the supply chain network due to unregistered movements of products. The hospital would like to forbid transshipment actions between CUs except in case of emergency. In some cases, the CP might have to send an emergency replenishment directly to the CU within few hours on small compartments that vehicles have available for such cases. This is done while vehicles perform other transportation activities. Therefore, there is not an actual extra cost. In the rare case that the CP lacks the product, suppliers must make the emergency deliveries. Stock out at the suppliers is extremely unlikely. Over the course of 9months there have only been 2 shortage cases, neither of which were infusion solutions. It is important to note that in the health care setting there is no concept of “lost sales”; the demand must be filled in one way or another. However, in our model, if the demand is fulfilled by an outside supplier it is considered as lost within our model.

Moving forward, the hospital wishes to redesign its supply chain network to distribute infusion solutions directly to each of the CUs from the CP, eliminating the individual hospital pharmacies. The goal for the medical center is to optimize the supply chain in this new distribution system without reducing the current service level and eliminating transshipments. We characterize this new problem as a two-echelon inventory distribution system with emergency replenishments, stochastic demand, target service level, limited storage capacity and restricted ordering policy on the first level of the supply chain by limiting the expected number of product references ordered to suppliers per week by the CP. Fig. 2
                      shows the proposed configuration of the supply chain. In fact, Nicholson, Vakharia, and Erengüç (2004) address the issue of determining which distribution network is better. A two-echelon system and a three-echelon system were compared to evaluate the possibility of outsourcing the distribution of non-critical medical supply inventory items. The paper concluded that the two-echelon system is more cost efficient, even for an approximate solution. We present a different approach, different cost structure and constraint sets to test the hypothesis on a real case.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Different approaches have been developed to solve similar problems in the health care industry. Details on the special characteristics of inventory systems in a healthcare setting are discussed by de Vries (2011), de Vries and Huijsman (2011).

One typical approach to solve similar problems is guided by the supply chain optimization approach. In this way, the benefits of coordinating the activities of every echelon in the system and the optimization of the policies at several points of the supply chain are simultaneously considered. Axsäter and Marklund (2008), Cachon (2001), Geng, Qiu, and Zhao (2010), Haji, Neghab, and Baboli (2009), Hernandez, Velasco, and Amaya (2008), van der Heijden (1997), Muckstadt and Roundy (1987) and Tagaras and Vlachos (2001) are examples of papers that consider this approach to deal with single-item, 1-warehouse and n-retailer distribution systems with stochastic or deterministic demand.

In addition, the joint-replenishment perspective is another relevant approach as it evaluates the benefits of coordinating the policies of different products across the supply chain. Recently, Zhou, Chen, and Ge (2013) present a non-linear model for the multi-product, multi-echelon inventory control problem using a (T, S) inventory control strategy solved by a genetic algorithm. According to their experiments, the joint replenishment strategy reduces the cost by up to 21% compared to the unified replenishment strategy. For further information on joint-replenishment approaches see Aharon, Boaz, and Shimrit (2009), Axsäter and Zhang (1999), Kang and Kim (2010), Khouja and Goyal (2008) and Narayanan and Robinson (2010). However, we have not found articles that optimize the multi-product, multi-echelon system with a framework that fits the concerns of the hospital, constraints on the service level and on the ordering policy like limiting the percentage of product references that are expected to be ordered every week rather than imposing stockout and ordering costs.

Regarding single-facility models, Kapalka, Katircioglu, and Puterman (1999) describe a single-warehouse, multiple-retailers system with multiple products that sequentially optimizes one product and one facility at a time. Their objective was to determine the optimal (s, S) values for each location (retailer) and each product with a service level requirement constraint. They modeled the system with a discrete-time Markov chain while considering a fixed ordering cost and daily holding cost rate. They optimize the long run average cost of inventory by a monotone search algorithm that purports significant time savings. However, there is no guarantee that their approach of optimizing the retailers first and then the warehouse separately is equivalent to the joint optimization solution. In fact, such a decomposition approach will almost always be suboptimal.


                     Nicholson et al. (2004) deal with a similar problem to the one addressed in this paper, but less complex as they do not consider storage capacity constraints and demands are deterministic. Their optimization model considers zero lead time and backorders satisfied by emergency deliveries. The decision variables are the levels s for the central warehouse, the hospital pharmacy and the CU. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost of one period subject to a target service level. The proposed solutions to these models are approximations using mixed-integer programming and greedy heuristics. They do not consider the joint-optimization of the whole system.

To our knowledge, there are no papers in the open literature that fulfill all the special features of the multi-echelon, multi-inventory healthcare (R, s, S) inventory supply chain such as emergency deliveries, target service level, limited storage capacity, batch ordering and a constraint on the ordering policy as a limit on the expected number of product references that are ordered to suppliers weekly with a joint-optimization approach. In addition, solving similar problems by dynamic or stochastic programming is not realistic as the dimensions of the problem grow exponentially with the number of decisions, states and periods (Aharon et al., 2009).

We assume that demand faced by each CU is stochastic, Poisson distributed and independent between products and CUs. The independence assumption is justified by analyzing historical demand data and finding no relevant correlation among CUs or among products (correlation coefficients are smaller than 0.1). A minimum inventory position to satisfy a service level α of 92% or higher is required for every product in the CU. In addition, every product i at the CU j employs a periodic review (R, s
                        
                           ij
                        , S
                        
                           ij
                        ) policy with review every R periods and replenishments within a fixed lead time L. Transshipments between CUs are not allowed.

Let j
                        =0 represent the index for the CP, and j
                        >0 the index for the corresponding CU j. The following assumptions were made about the CP: (1) there is no economic benefit from suppliers to coordinate the ordering policy among different products; (2) there is a review period every R periods for all products at the same time; (3) the CP is replenished from a trustable source in a fixed lead time which equals one period length (i.e., L
                        =one week); and (4) employs a periodic review (nQ, r
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i0, R) order-up-to S
                        
                           i0 policy. Further, the CP is required to follow a batch-ordering policy with batch sizes b
                        
                           i
                         fixed by the suppliers and there is a restriction on the maximum expected percentage of product references γ that can be ordered by the CP every week.

We also assume that products do not have an expiration date, emergency deliveries can be made from the CP to the CU immediately and instantaneously any time (see Section 2 on trade-off analysis between time until next regular order arrives and emergency delivery). When demand is not supplied by the CU or emergency deliveries, it is supplied by outside sources, therefore it is lost in the supply chain model. All demands must be supplied if there is stock. Further, there is a maximum storage capacity at the CP (m
                        
                           i0) and at the CUs (m
                        
                           ij
                        ) for each product reference. Fixed ordering costs are not considered but the ordering policy must respect the limitation on the expected number of product references per order.

Each period, these events take place as shown in Fig. 3
                        :

The goal of the model is to minimize the stock-on-hand value Z of the system equal to: Z
                        =
                        Z
                        0
                        +
                        Z
                        1 where, Z
                        1 represents the stock-on-hand value for the CUs and Z
                        0 represents the stock-on-hand value for the CP. The minimization is subject to a service level constraint and a constraint on the expected number of product references ordered by the CP. Let X
                        
                           i0 be a random variable representing the stock-on-hand of product i in the CP at the review period, let X

                        With this model structure, we propose an approach to minimize the expected stock-on-hand value for the overall distribution system with Eq. (1). Constraints (2) and (3) represent the limited capacity of the system to store products. Since the CP is subject to a batch-ordering policy, Eq. (2) implies that if the CP is required to raise its stock up to S
                        
                           i0 with batches of size b
                        
                           i
                        , in the worst case, the CP will surpass S
                        
                           i0 by an amount equal to b
                        
                           i
                        
                        −1 but in any case it must not surpass m
                        
                           i0. Constraints (4) and (5) represent the need of the CUs and the CP to assure that the minimum inventory position fulfills some target rate α. Finally, constraint (6) limits the percentage of products that are expected to be ordered every week by the CP. The probability of ordering any product is defined by Eq. (8).

                        Eq. (9) shows the typical description of the (s, S) policy with lost sales for the care units, while Eq. (10) includes the concept of emergency replenishments delivered by the CP and the batch ordering policy for the CP. Whenever a CU is not available to meet a demand, the CP must supply it. As a consequence, we focus first on the CUs as also proposed by Kapalka et al. (1999). However, we will ensure that our decomposition is optimal for the joint problem. With this approach we derive the one-period transition probabilities from state u to state v. These denote the probability of having v units of product i at CU j on hand given that there were u units one period before, and are given as follows:

                         to compute accurately the expected stock-on-hand for every product (see Eq. (18)). These represent the limiting probabilities of having an inventory level of k units of product i in CU j when the order has just arrived. They are calculated with the limiting probabilities of having a certain stock level at the beginning of the period and the probability density function of the demand. To explain further, the stock-on-hand after the orders have just arrived equals the stock-on-hand at the review period minus the demand during lead-time plus the stock just delivered. Bear in mind the assumption of lost sales implies that the stock is never below zero. If the stock is zero at the review period (π
                        0ij
                        ), no matter the value of the demand, the stock just after the order has arrived is η

                        Eq. (20) shows the rate of emergency deliveries. This is given by the portion of the Poisson process for the demand faced by the CU during stock-out. The probability of stock-out is defined by (21) representing the average probability of being in stockout at any day r
                        ∈{0, 1, …, R
                        −1}. The rate in which regular orders are triggered from the CUs to the CP is defined by Eq. (22). Finally, the expected inventory in the CP is as defined by (23).

We now demonstrate that optimizing independently the CUs will provide the same solution as the joint-optimization case. We first formally recall two well-known mathematical properties.

Next, we show that we can optimize the values of s
                     
                        ij
                      for all CUs and the CP and all products by finding smallest values that do not violate constraint (4) (Theorem 5.1). Theorem 5.2 then demonstrates that these values are optimal for the overall jointly optimized system. Finally, we show that the optimal policy for a CU is always (s, s
                     +1) (Theorem 5.3).
                        Theorem 5.1
                        
                           The minimum quantity required to satisfy an α percentage of the demand for at least one period length will provide the optimal value of s
                           
                              ij
                            
                           for a given product i in a given CU j when the lead time is less than or equal to the period length. Hence, the optimal s
                           
                              ij

By definition of the (s, S) inventory control policy, the minimum inventory position that can remain in CU j after replenishment will be s
                           +1. Therefore, the solution of (24) provides the minimum point where the decision of triggering an order must be taken.□

                            because the rationality of the system implies that if the order size triggered by a CU increases, the expected stock-on-hand in that CU will increase as well.□

However, to further illustrate Theorem 5.3, we show that the last statement is true by emulating the performance of the system. We aim to show that the rationality of the system implies that the cost function increases as S
                     
                        ij
                      increases. We begin by, without loss of generality, simplifying our system to one CP, two identical CUs and only one product. The simplified system is shown in Fig. 4
                     . We may generalize the simplified system to the larger one due to the fact that we analyze the effect of the variation of one specific parameter S
                     
                        ij
                      on the overall system, regardless of the other CUs. Given that the CUs are independent, their costs will not be affected.

We compare the behavior of the system for a given CU policy, the

                        ij
                      by one in CU j: (1) increasing the size of the weekly orders and (2) reduction of emergency deliveries. It is obvious that increasing the order-up-to level in the CU will increase the expected stock-on-hand value because the sizes of the orders will be larger and less frequent. Also, the emergency delivery ratio will decrease because the probability of stock-out is smaller.

Consequently, these effects will impact the CP performance. Increasing the size of the orders and decreasing the emergency deliveries modify the demand behavior faced by the CP. Special features of the Poisson distribution and the definition of the system allow us to conclude the following:
                        Theorem 5.4
                        
                           Increasing parameter S
                           
                              ij
                            
                           for some CU within a small ∊ (which is discrete and strictly positive) decreases the expected average stock-on-hand for the CP if and only if the CP does not have to modify its inventory policy to maintain the target service level.
                        

The proof also follows from the procedure above in the proof in Theorem 5.3.□


                           The cost advantage obtained from increasing parameter S
                           
                              ij
                            
                           on the CP’s expected stock-on-hand is always less than the increment on the average stock-on-hand on the corresponding CU j.
                        

The proof follows from the procedure above in Theorem 5.3. Increasing the expected stock-on-hand at any CU one unit decreases the average stock on the CP by less than one unit considering the target fill rate constraint and constant demand.□


                     Fig. 5
                      shows the results obtained by the analysis for one product and 2 CUs. We can see that objective function Z (which can be decomposed into Z
                     0, the average stock-on-hand at the CP, plus Z
                     1, the average stock-on-hand at the CUs) is strictly increasing and convex as result of the effects previously discussed. Moreover, we can see the behavior of the decomposed cost function when increasing the order-up-to level for any CU.

As a consequence of Theorem 5.2, the optimization of the CU subproblem is also optimal for the joint system. Therefore, we proceed with the optimization of the inventory control policy for the CP. Constraint (6) forces us to consider simultaneously all the products in the CP. Absent this constraint, we would simply conclude that the (s, s
                     +1) policy would be optimal for every product in the CU and the CP. There is no issue with the CU ordering every product every week, however, the number of orders per week is restricted at the CP due to human resource constraints. Nevertheless, we may still optimize parameter s
                     
                        i0 easily by finding the smallest value that satisfies constraint (5) as dictated by Theorem 5.1. The procedure to demonstrate this is analog to the one developed for the CUs.

It remains only to optimize parameter S
                     
                        i0 for the CP. Recall that our objective is to minimize the stock-on-hand value while still respecting a constraint on the expected number of orders per week. Theorem 5.1 showed us that the service level constraint is respected through s
                     
                        i0 and the constraint on the expected number of orders per week will be respected through S
                     
                        i0. It follows that one should choose to minimize the stock-on-hand of the most expensive products (ordering them more frequently), while keeping larger inventories of cheaper products to reduce the overall number of products ordered per week. Therefore, we propose the following heuristic to minimize the cost. Better parameters of S

The first step of the heuristic is to relax constraint (6). By doing so, a lower bound on S
                     
                        i0 is obtained by finding the minimum value that satisfies the following constraints for each product i, where d is some positive integer:

For a first numerical example, the model was implemented in JAVA and was tested using a 1.50GHz Intel Celeron processor with 224MB of RAM. The instance was composed of 4 CUs and 4 products. The storage capacity at the CUs was assumed to be enough to store the historical average of product requested. The running time was 1642 s. The parameters and results are displayed in Tables 1–3
                     
                     
                     . It becomes clear that more expensive products are not supposed to be stored in large quantities and therefore, they will be the ones ordered in small quantities but more frequently. Also, batching has an important effect on the decision variables as it affects the transition probabilities and if the product has high demand, optimal inventory policy parameters are elevated too. Further, the constraint (6) plays a critical role in the computation of inventory policies at the CP. Table 2 presents the stock value when Eq. (6) is considered (UB
                        CP
                     ), and when is not (LB
                        CP
                     ). Note that by including this ordering constraint, the inventory holding cost at the CP is increased by 243%.

In the real case instance, the central pharmacy (CP) at the University Hospital of Nantes has 74 products of infusion solutions that require 360m2 of the warehouse. This equates to 41.86% of the available stocking space (CETI, 2007). About 1.5 million units of infusion solutions are delivered by the CP annually (CETI, 2007).

Precise historical demand data faced by the CP is not available. However, data of demand in the last 20months made by each of the 250 CUs was provided in order to estimate the monthly demand of each product in each CU (as each CU does not order every product, we account for 3184 orders from CUs for different products). Following the literature Vernimmen, Dullaert, Willem, and Witlox (2008), we assume a Poisson distributed demand as statistical analysis did not yield any other feasible distribution. The mean demand per CU per product is 9.88 units with a standard deviation of 25.64. The 90th percentile of the weekly demand per CU per product is 27 units and the 95th percentile is 53 units per week. The maximum value of the mean demand per product per CU is 402.2 units. The aggregated demand of the CUs is used as the demand on the CP as demands are assumed independent.

The mean ratio of storage capacity over the average weekly demand per CU per product is 25.92 with a standard deviation of 52.77. The minimum ratio is 0.86 (requiring more than 1 replenishment per week) and the maximum ratio is 500. On average, product unitary cost c
                     
                        i
                      is 1.02 euros and the standard deviation is 1.24 euros. In all cases, c
                     
                        i
                     
                     ∈[0.04, 8.57] euros. Most of the products are sold in batches of 6, 10, 12, 20, 30 or 48 units. Only 2 products are not sold in batches (b
                     
                        i
                     
                     =1). A particular product is sold in batches of 250 units. The CP has an average storage capacity of 111.5 batches per product ranging from 4 to 1000 batches. As for dispersion, the standard deviation is 179.68 batches, the first quartile is 23 batches, the median is 50 batches and the third quartile is 120 batches. Only two products have storage capacity at the CP of 1000 batches, that is when b
                     
                        i
                     
                     =1.

For the real situation of the hospital, p
                     =74, n
                     =250, τ
                     =92%, and γ
                     =20%. The computational time of the algorithm is 5h. The solution of our model (UB) yielded an average stock-on-hand value of 33,439 euros. The current stock-on-hand value of the hospital using their current methodology is approximately 60,740 euros. Our methodology provides a reduction of 44.9% while still respecting the service level requirements. As expected, more expensive products will be ordered more frequently in lower quantities while the cheaper ones will be kept on-hand in larger quantities to avoid ordering more products per week than dictated by the constraints.

The expected percentage of products to be ordered weekly at each iteration of the while loop in the heuristic algorithm is shown in Fig. 6
                     . At first, the model under the relaxed ordering constraint proposes to order every product every week. This policy provides a lower bound (LB) that in the real case equals to 22,042 euros. The gap between LB and UB is 34.08% computed as (UB-LB)/LB. The iterations of the algorithm progress to respect constraint (6). The larger improvements in the early iterations are due to the augmentation of the products with the largest beta values first. The speed of the improvement is significantly reduced in the later iterations. This is also due to the decreasing benefit of larger order-up-to levels as the constraint is designed only to reduce the number of products ordered, not the quantity in the order. Naturally, the objective function has an opposite behavior as shown in Fig. 7
                     . The first iterations have little impact on the expected stock-on-hand value.

Finally, 30 random instances were generated with 10, 50, 100, 180 or 200 CUs and products. The instances are labeled as n
                     −
                     p
                     −
                     x. Recall that n is the number of CUs and p the number of products. x is used to itemize. The mean demand faced at the CU i for product j, λ
                     
                        ij
                     , is randomly generated with Normal (1.88, 5.64) probability density function. Let m
                     
                        ij
                     
                     ∼
                     max(5, λ
                     
                        ij
                     
                     ·Normal (2, 5)) to randomly generate the storage capacity at CU i for product j. For each product i, c
                     
                        i
                      is generated with a truncated normal distribution with parameters 1.02 for the mean, and 1.24 for the standard deviation. The size of each batch b
                     
                        i
                      is chosen from the set {1, 6, 10, 20, 30, 48} while the depot storage capacity m
                     0i
                      is selected from the set {200, 400, 600, 800, 100, 1500, 3000} with uniform probabilities. Again, for the experiments we considered τ
                     =92% and γ
                     =50%. Table 4
                      presents the results on the generated instances. Column LB presents the cost of the policy when constraint (6) is relaxed. Column UB presents the solution cost for our policy and the percentage gap between both is computed as 100· (UB-LB)/UB. Computation times in seconds are presented in the column CPU. On one hand, optimizing each product independently without considering constraint (6) does not provide tight lower bounds. On the other hand, the computation time of our method remains reasonable considering the operational constraints on instances with up to 200 products and 100 CUs. Fig. 8
                      presents the mean computation time (CPU) per instance size. It increases with the number of CUs and products, but more importantly, with the dimension of the space state Ω
                     
                        i0 for every product i.

Note that a new policy is designed to minimize the expected stock-on-hand value for the long term. Nonetheless, as new products might be included by the hospital or others might be withdrawn, the decision is only updated at most on a quarterly basis with the new set of products and updated estimations of the demand. There is little interest in updating the inventory policy more frequently as demand forecast remains unchanged for several months. In practice, the decision maker might take about one day to optimize the system. Thus, the methodology responds to the operational requirements.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we study the problem of determining optimal parameters for the order-up-to level inventory control policies on the one-warehouse, n-retailer, multi-product system with batching and a new constraint on the ordering policies for the healthcare industry and the benefits of having a two-echelon distribution system (versus three) on a hospital network of CUs. The objective is to minimize the stock-on-hand value at the supply chain subject to capacity constraints, requirements on minimal inventory positions, batch-ordering policies, and a limit on the maximum expected number of products per order made to suppliers. The model is specially made for non-critical products with long expiry dates such as infusion solutions. Ordering costs and stock-out costs are not considered since ordering costs are not relevant to the hospital (but a constraint on the ordering policy was imposed instead) and prevention of stockout is handled via the service level constraint rather than an associated cost that in the healthcare setting is difficult to calculate given its high variability. A Markov Chain model is used to find the weekly demand ratio for each product faced by the central depot. Analysis is made to provide several important properties of the model: (1) The s of the policy may be derived from a simple probability calculation. (2) The optimal solution of the decomposed problem is equivalent to the joint optimization solution, and (3) it is proven that the optimal solution for the CUs is (s, s
                     +1) given the cost structure. We have also provided a heuristic algorithm to find the near optimal policy for the S
                     
                        ij
                      value at the CP. All other policy parameters are guaranteed optimal through the model structure.

For the real case of the university hospital in Nantes, the model is expected to reduce the stock-on-hand value up to 45% and will be implemented at the hospital within the next year. The service level will remain the same, even when HP are eliminated. Future research might involve expanding the model to include every type of product with expiry dates and special storing conditions. It would also be interesting to consider the routing decisions of the inventory in the supply chain in order to further improve the overall system performance.
