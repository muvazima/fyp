                  The TiO2 coated silicate micro-spheres (SMS) core–shell particles (SMS@TiO2) were synthesized using the sol–gel reaction followed by calcination. The SMS@TiO2 particles were used to enhance the light diffusion property of polycarbonate (PC) composites. Our experimental analysis shows that the TiO2 was coated on the SMS particles and the optimum parameters of the reaction were 4:1 of the Si/Ti molar ratio and 500°C of the calcination temperature. The UV–Vis spectra indicate that SMS@TiO2 can absorb or hinder the UV light, which may prolong the service life of PC light diffusion materials. Compared to that of PC composites physically mixed with SMS+TiO2, the haze of the PC/SMS@TiO2 composites was little affected, while the transmittance was obviously enhanced, which can be increased from 55.5% for PC/TiO2/SMS to 70.3% for PC/SMS@TiO2 with only 0.6wt% filler loading.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recently, considerable attraction has been concentrated on the development of light diffusion materials because they are key materials that can be widely used in the lighting technology of light emitting diode (LED), liquid crystal display (LCD) backlight units, and other fields. Light diffusion materials are optical materials that can homogeneously diffuse a point or line light source into a line or surface light source, respectively. To realize this function, the materials must exhibit both good transmittance and high haze properties [1–14].

A light diffusion material is composed of the matrix component and the light diffusing agent. The light diffusion material is usually prepared by melt-mixing, in-situ blending and solution processing [15–30]. The most common method is melt-blending. The matrix component of a typical light diffusion material is polycarbonate (PC). Light diffusing agents can be inorganic (silicate microspheres (SMS), glass beads, TiO2, CaCO3, MgSiO3, BaSO4, ZnS, BaS and so on) or organic (polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polystyrene (PS), acrylic resin and so on) [6,31,32]. Good dispersion of a light diffusing agent at the micro and nano levels in PC is the most important indicator of good optical performance. But the problem is that current light diffusing agents do not have uniform and stable dispersion in PC. Attempts have been made to physically blend two or more inorganic or organic light diffusing agents, but the obtained optical performance of the light diffusion materials was not satisfactory. As TiO2 has a high refractive index and excellent heat resistance, TiO2 has been suggested as a potential candidate material [33,34].

SMS is the most well-known light diffusing agent, as its constituent atoms are connected by Si–O bonds to form a three-dimensional structure. Compared with other inorganic light diffusing agents [31,32], SMS has good dispersion, good compatibility, low water absorption, good transparency and the ability to improve the heat resistance of PC. But the haze improvement is not very satisfactory for light diffusion applications. TiO2 is used in a wide range of applications, such as photocatalysis, separations, sensor devices, paints, and dye-sensitized solar cells. Because of the polar Ti–O bond on the surface of TiO2, the water molecules absorbed by the surface can dissociate to form hydroxyl groups The hydroxyl groups can improve the properties of TiO2 as an adsorbent or carrier, as well as facilitate surface modification [35,36]. As an inorganic light diffusing agent, the haze of the light diffusion material could be over 90% when TiO2 is composited with PC. TiO2 particles are usually hard and irregular, so it is difficult to disperse TiO2 particles evenly in PC and agglomeration of TiO2 particles will occur. And the surface of material will be uneven if TiO2 agglomerates.

SMS@TiO2 is currently a composite material of high interest [37–41]. In this study, we prepared a series of SMS@TiO2 samples and evaluated their light diffusing properties. The resulting light diffusing agent was well dispersed in PC. When PC was melt blending with the light diffusing agent, the resulting light diffusion material can exhibit both good transmittance and high haze properties.

Tetrabutyl titanate (TBT), acetylacetone (AcAc), acetic acid (HAc), and absolute ethanol (99.5%) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Silicate micro-sphere (SMS, 2μm) powder was purchased from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. Polycarbonate (U5A12921) was purchased from Teijin Co., Ltd.

Titanium sol was synthesized via the sol–gel process described below. Several samples were prepared according to the conditions specified in Table 1
                        . For each sample, TBT was first quickly mixed with 3.0ml of AcAc (see Table 1). Then, 56ml of absolute ethanol was slowly added into the above solution with stirring at room temperature for 0.5h. After that, a solution containing 1.6ml of H2O, 2.6ml of HAc and 28ml of absolute ethanol was added dropwise into the solution with vigorous stirring at room temperature for 3h to obtain the titanium sol. After evaporation of the titanium sol to dryness, the resultant power was calcined at different temperature (200°C, 300°C, 400°C, 500°C and 600°C) for 4h to obtain the control TiO2 particles. For the batch synthesis of SMS@TiO2 core–shell particles, 1g of SMS powder was added to the prepared titanium sol with stirring at room temperature for 3h. Yellow powders were obtained after the mixture was evaporated to dryness at room temperature. After the powder was pulverized, it was washed and centrifuged (three times with deionized water first, and then three times with absolute ethanol). Subsequently, the sample was dried in an oven at 110°C to obtain a white product. After calcination at different temperatures (200°C, 300°C, 400°C, 500°C and 600°C) for 4h, the SMS@TiO2 core–shell particles were obtained and labeled as TS–x–y, where TS refers to SMS@TiO2, x is the amount of TBT and y is the calcination temperature.

SMS, TiO2, SMS@TiO2 core–shell particles and the physical mixture of original SMS and TiO2 were used as the light diffusing fillers. To prepare a given light diffusion composite, 200g of the PC was mixed with 0.2g, 0.4g, 0.6g, 0.8g, 1.0g, 1.2g, 1.6g, 2.0g, 2.4g or 2.8g of the light diffusing agent in the mixer. The typical process was as follows: 200g of PC was mixed with the filler in a closed mixing machine (XSS-300, Shanghai Branch Chong plastic equipment Co., Ltd.). And the parameters were set at 260–270°C for the first zone, 260–270°C for the second zone, 30rpm for the speed and 1–2min for the residence time. Then, the PC light diffusion material was prepared by the twin-screw extruder with a sheet shape die (CET-20, Coperion Keya Nanjing Machinery Co., Ltd.). The parameters of the twin-screw extruder were set at 240–250°C for the first zone, 250–260°C for the second zone, 260–270°C for the third zone, 270–280°C for the fourth zone, 270–280°C for the fifth zone, 270–280°C for the sixth zone, 270–280°C for the head zone, and 2–2.5MPa for the pressure. The 1-mm-thick plates were obtained as the final products after extrusion and shaping.

The morphology and microstructure of the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL, Japan), X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-2200/PC, Rigaku, Japan), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area analysis (BET, ASAP 2020M+C, Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA). UV–Vis diffuse reflectance (DRS) electronic spectra of samples were collected at ambient conditions on a UV-2501PC apparatus in the wavelength range of 200–1000nm. The prepared 1-mm-thick plates were tested by an EEL57D haze meter (Shanghai Precision Instrument Co./GB/T2410-2008).

As illustrated in Fig. 1
                           , the SMS@TiO2 core–shell particles were synthesized by the following two main steps: (1) preparation of titanium sol; (2) deposition of titanium sol on the surface of SMS to form SMS@TiO2 particles through the sol–gel reaction. To verify the materials coated on SMS were TiO2, XRD analysis was employed to investigate the crystal phase of TS-1.5 calcined at different temperatures. The typical XRD pattern in Fig. 2
                            reveals that, with the increase of the calcination temperature, the peaks get sharper and stronger. When the powders are calcined at 200°C and 300°C, a weak diffraction peak assigned to anatase at 2θ
                           =25.2° is observed, which suggests the initial phase transformation is from amorphous to anatase. When the temperature reaches 400°C, the clear diffraction peaks at 2θ
                           =25.2, 38.5, 48.3, 54.1/55.7 (overlapped) and 62.8° can be indexed to (101), (004), (200), (105/211) and (204) reflections of anatase TiO2, respectively. When the temperature reaches 500°C and 600°C, the appearance of weak diffraction peaks of rutile at 2θ
                           =27.4° indicates transformation from anatase to rutile has occurred. The amount of rutile TiO2 can be quantified by comparing the integrated intensities of anatase (101) (A
                           anatase) and rutile (110) reflections (A
                           rutile) [42–44]. It shows the coexistence of anatase and rutile when the powders are calcined at 500–600°C.

The morphology and structure of SMS and TS-1.5 samples were investigated by SEM (Fig. 3
                           ). The original SMS sample shows a uniform diameter of about 1.7μm (Fig. 3a and b) with smooth and clean surfaces. After immersion in TBT-containing solution, drying and calcination, it can be seen that some porous layers were coated on the SMS surfaces, and the diameter of the microspheres increases to about 2.1μm (Fig. 3c and d). The BET analysis shows that the specific surface area of the SMS was 6.0m2/g, and the TS-1.5’s was 106.4m2/g, indicating a 16.7-fold increase in the specific surface area.


                           Fig. 4
                            shows the evolution of the morphologies of SMS@TiO2 core–shell particles with respect to the different molar ratio of Si and Ti in the synthesis procedure. When the molar ratio is higher than 6:1 (Fig. 4a–c), some smooth SMS surfaces can still be observed, which indicates that the amount of TBT is not enough to completely cover all surface of SMS. When the Si/Ti molar ratio reduces to 3:1 (Fig. 4e and f), thicker coating layers and some free TiO2 particles appear and the SMS particles do not maintain the regular spherical shape because of the overdose of TBT. When the Si/Ti molar ratio is 4:1 (Fig. 4d), the sol–gel reaction and the calcination give a relative uniform coating layers of TiO2 on the surface of SMS spheres.


                           Fig. 5
                            shows the UV–Vis spectra of TS-1.5 calcined at different temperatures. In the ultraviolet region of 200–400nm, when the TS-1.5 powders are calcined at 200–400°C, the transmittance gradually increases as the calcination temperature is elevated; when the temperature reaches 500°C, the transmittance is significantly lowered. The reason is that the powders contain both rutile and anatase, and the rutile is conducive to the absorption of ultraviolet light. On the other hand, in the visible region, when the TS-1.5 powders are calcined at 200–400°C, the transmittance gradually increases as the calcination temperature is elevated. When the temperature reaches 500°C, the transmittance of the samples gets much higher which may be caused by the disturbed distribution of rutile and anatase after calcination at the high temperature (⩾500°C). It also indicates that SMS@TiO2 powders calcined at 500°C can absorb or hinder the UV light, which may prolong the service life of PC light diffusion materials [45–47]. Therefore, the optimum calcination temperature is 500°C.


                           Fig. 6
                            gives the transmittance and haze of PC/TS-1.5-500. It can be seen that when PC is melt-blended with the TS-1.5-500, the transmittance of the composites decreases and the haze increases with the increase of the amount of TS-1.5-500. With 0.1wt% TS-1.5-500 loading, the transmittance is 83% and the haze is only 60%; and with 0.4wt% TS-1.5-500 loading, the haze is 82%. With 0.8wt% TS-1.5-500 loading the haze is over 90%. Beyond 0.8wt% TS-1.5-500 loading, the haze is basically unchanged.

The transmittance of PC/TS-1.5-500 is much higher than PC/TiO2, and the transmittance decreases with the increase of the amount of TS-1.5-500 (Fig. 7
                           a). The haze of PC/TiO2 is generally high but it remains unchanged with the increase of the amount of TiO2 (Fig. 7b). This is because the poor dispersion of TiO2 in PC. Fig. 8 gives the SEM of PC/TiO2 and PC/TS-1.5-500. It can be seen that TiO2 agglomerates when composited with PC (Fig. 8
                           a), and TS-1.5-500 has a good dispersion in PC (Fig. 8b). As is shown in Fig. 9
                           b, the haze of PC/TS-1.5-500 increases with TS-1.5-500 loading. When the filler loading exceeds 0.5wt%, the haze of PC/TS-1.5-500 has higher haze than PC/TiO2. Despite the poor dispersion in the material, the addition of TiO2 can enhance the haze of the material obviously. And When TiO2 is composited with SMS, the resulting light diffusing agent can have a good dispersion in PC and the resulting light diffusion material can reach high haze.


                           Fig. 9 shows the transmittance and haze of PC/TS-1.5-500 and PC/TiO2/SMS. Compared to that of the PC composite with physically mixed SMS+TiO2 (i.e. PC/TiO2/SMS), the transmittance of PC/TS-1.5-500 is obviously higher. For example, with only 0.6wt% filler loading, the transmittance for PC/TiO2/SMS is 55.5%, while the transmittance for PC/TS-1.5-500 is 70.3% (Fig. 9a). On the other hand, the haze of PC/TS-1.5-500 is little affected (Fig. 9b). This shows that modified SMS with TiO2 can function as light diffusing agents, which can improve the transmittance of PC without reducing the haze.

After measurements of the haze and transmittance of the light diffusion materials composited with 0.6wt% loading of different light diffusion agents (Fig. 10
                           ), it is found that the PC composited with SMS gets transmittance of 73% and haze of 87%. The transmittance and haze of the PC-based materials composited with TS-0.1-500–TS-1.5-500 have no obvious difference with the increase of the amount of Ti. And when composited with TS-2.0-500 and TS-2.5-500, the transmittance of the materials is decreased but the haze is basically unchanged. The reason is that the amount of Ti is lacking in TS-0.1-500–TS-1.0-500 so that the transmittance and haze are little affected with respect to the SMS filler. The amount of Ti is overdosed in TS-2.0-500 and TS-2.5-500, which contain free TiO2 that can influence the transmittance of the PC-based composites.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Light diffusing agents based on SMS@TiO2 core–shell particles were prepared in this study. The size of original SMS particles turned from 1.7μm to about 2μm after coating by TiO2. By SEM images and XRD patterns we obtained that the optimum molar ratio of Si/Ti was 4:1 and the optimum calcination temperature was 500°C. The UV–Vis spectra indicated that the TS sample could absorb UV light and prolong the life of the material after the SMS@TiO2 powders were calcined at 500°C, which contains both anatase and rutile. Compared to that of PC composites with physically mixed SMS+TiO2, the haze of the PC/SMS@TiO2 composites was little affected, while the transmittance was obviously enhanced, which could be increased from 55.5% for PC/TiO2/SMS to 70.3% for PC/SMS@TiO2 with only 0.6wt% filler loading.
