                  This paper develops a two-phase fuzzy goal programming (FGP) approach for multi-level linear programming (MLLP) problems in an uncertain environment. A numerical MLLP model is established based on a confidence level. In the first phase, an FGP model is used to find a solution that reaches the overall satisfaction of all decision-makers (DMs), ensuring that the fuzzy goal of each higher-level DM is more satisfied than those of lower-level DMs. Since the higher-level DM has the direct authority to manage the subordinate DM, an adjustment scheme is provided in the second phase for each higher-level DM, who has the opportunity to increase or decrease the satisfaction degree of their fuzzy goal by changing the relative satisfaction of the lower-level DM compared to that of their higher-level DM. A fuzzy variable of the relative satisfaction containing a set of linguistic terms is provided for these adjustments. The adjustment processes are carried out sequentially, from the top to bottom in the hierarchical decision structure. The proposed FGP model in the second phase considers these sequential adjustments. A numerical example and comparisons with existing methods are used to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Hierarchical decision structures are common in government policies, competitive economic systems, supply chains, vehicle path planning problems, and so on. Various studies have proposed mathematical models to solve such problems [10–12,14,33]. In addition to mathematical programming formulations, several solution approaches that adapt to other decision-making environments have been proposed, such as decision support systems [15] and rule sets based approaches [36,37], to solve problems that cannot be precisely formulated as mathematical programming models. In this area, multi-level linear programming (MLLP) is a solution technique for solving hierarchical decision-making problems, assuming that the objectives and associated constraints of decision-makers (DMs) can be expressed as linear algebraic functions. MLLP problems generally include sequential decision processes (from the top to bottom), interactive decision-makings, and a leader–follower relationship within two adjacent levels [10,11]. For MLLP problems, one DM is located at each decision level, and a linear objective function needs to be optimized.

Several typical MLLP approaches [1,2,6,28,30–35] have been developed based on vertex enumeration or a nonlinear transformation function with a Lagrangian term. Based on vertex enumeration, Bialas and Karwan [6] proposed the kth-best solution algorithm for bi-level programming problems, which was extended to fuzzy bi-level [31] and fuzzy tri-level programming problems [34,35]. In transformation function approaches [30,33], Lagrangian terms are included based on Kuhn–Tucker conditions to formulate nonlinear models. These approaches may be inefficient in solving large-scale problems, considering the NP-hard property [5] of multi-level programming. Furthermore, the use of a transformation function may produce the following paradox: the final solution more closely approaches the individual optimum of a lower-level DM’s objective function than that of a higher-level DM’s objective function when the two objective functions highly conflict.

Lai [11] and Shih et al. [25] considered DMs with imprecise goals for their objective functions [12,13], and presented fuzzy programming models for MLLP problems, in which the lower-level DM’s optimality search is restricted by the higher-level DM’s goal. In these approaches, fuzzy goals are used to describe the objective functions and to characterize each higher-level DM’s decision variables. The resulting solutions can be modified by higher-level DMs level by level. However, methods [11,25] that use the max–min operator [4] for optimization may produce undesirable solutions due to the inconsistency between objective functions and decision variables. To avoid this, Sakawa et al. [21] developed an interactive fuzzy programming approach for solving MLLP problems that eliminates the fuzzy goals of decision variables and specifies each higher-level DM’s achievement of the fuzzy goal in terms of the ratio of the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goal for each lower-level DM to that of their higher-level DM. This concept has been adopted by several scholars to solve MLLP problems with fuzzy parameters [22,23] and multi-level 0–1 programming problems [19,20]. Sinha [26,27] developed supervised approaches by extending the concept of Sakawa et al. [21] to solve MLLP problems via the redefinition of tolerance values of fuzzy goals. However, the above approaches [19–23,26,27] implement the interactive solution processes by intuitively adjusting the desired satisfaction degrees of the various fuzzy goals. Furthermore, the solution processes in Sinha’s method make the lowest-level DM the most important in the decision structure, because their decisions may remain unchanged or be closest to their individual best ones.

Pramanik and Roy [17] adopted fuzzy goals to specify the decision variables of higher-level DMs and proposed weighted/unweighted fuzzy goal programming (FGP) models for MLLP problems to obtain a satisfactory solution. Arora and Gupta [3] extended this approach by employing dynamic programming to solve the FGP model in sequence for bi-level programming problems. However, these methods [3,17] may produce a higher satisfaction degree for the fuzzy goal of a lower-level DM than that for a higher-level one when the former’s goal is relatively easy to achieve. To deal with this problem, Chen and Chen [8,9] applied a fuzzy variable of relative satisfactions between lower- and higher-level DMs to solve the decentralized bi-level optimization problem, ensuring that the integrated satisfaction of the higher-level DM is not less than that of the lower-level DM.

The present study develops a two-phase FGP approach for MLLP problems, where all the parameters are expressed as fuzzy numbers based on the fuzzy set theory of Zadeh [29] to account for the uncertainty in decision-making problems [30,31,35]. The concept of 
                        
                           α
                        
                     -cuts [18] is applied to transform fuzzy mathematical problems into common numerical models to simplify the solution processes without losing the fuzzy essence of the problem, where the 
                        
                           α
                        
                      level is usually regarded as the confidence level of the fuzzy information. This study also employs 
                        
                           α
                        
                     -cuts to formulate MLLP problems as FGP models at the desired 
                        
                           α
                        
                      level to enhance computational efficiency. In addition, due to the paradox that appears in related MLLP studies, this paper presumes that the goals of higher-level DMs should reach a higher level of satisfaction than those of lower-level DMs. As such, in the first phase, the maximum satisfaction of the overall fuzzy goals is achieved at the desired 
                        
                           α
                        
                      level under the condition described above. To ascertain the feasibility of the first phase, a pre-check model is provided to examine whether some leader–follower relationship constraints are violated in terms of the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goals before trying to solve the MLLP problem.

Based on the solutions from the first phase, an adjustment scheme is provided in the second phase for each higher-level DM, who can increase (or decrease) the satisfaction degree of their fuzzy goal by decreasing (or increasing) the satisfaction degree of the subordinate DMs in the hierarchical decision structure. A fuzzy decision variable is used to achieve this, in which a linguistic term is used to express the relative satisfaction of the fuzzy goal for each lower-level DM compared to that of their higher-level DM. The linguistic terms specify the adjustment of the satisfaction degree and ensure that the satisfaction degree of a lower-level DM does not exceed that of the higher-level DM. In addition, for a DM at a given level, the determined (adjusted or unchanged) satisfaction degrees and the associated relative satisfactions for the upper-level DMs are treated as the constraints when such a DM adjusts the satisfaction of his fuzzy goal to meet the characteristics of MLLP problems. The adjustment process is performed iteratively from the top to bottom, excluding the DM at the lowest level. In addition, to enhance solution efficiency, this study employs the method of variable change [16] to transform linear fractional goal programming into linear programming. The validity of this method was proven by Charnes and Cooper [7]. Using the concept of variable change [16], the proposed second-phase model with linear fractional constraints is formulated to have a linear form. With the proposed two-phase approach, each DM achieves a satisfactory or acceptable degree of their fuzzy goal.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the formulation of MLLP problems with fuzzy numbers. Section 3 describes the proposed two-phase FGP approach. Two numerical examples are provided in Section 4 to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed models and demonstrate the violation of leader–follower relationship in terms of the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goals in an MLLP problem, respectively. Comparisons with existing approaches and a sensitivity analysis are also presented in this section. Discussions of the proposed approach are provided in Section 5, and the conclusions are given in Section 6.

MLLP problems have more than one DM. A DM is located at each decision level, and a linear objective function needs to be optimized. Considering the uncertainty inherent in the decision-making process [12], this paper formulates MLLP problems with all the parameters in the objective functions and constraints expressed as fuzzy numbers based on fuzzy set theory [29].

                      are expressed as fuzzy numbers [30,31,35] characterized by any type of membership function, such as triangular or trapezoidal, depending on the DM’s preference.

A two-phase FGP approach is proposed in this section for solving the MLLP problems set out above. To increase computational efficiency, the concept of 
                        
                           α
                        
                     -cuts [18] is adopted to transform the MLLP problems with parameters represented by fuzzy numbers into common numerical problems. Based on the numerical MLLP formulation, the FGP model is constructed in the first phase. This study presumes that the satisfaction degree for each higher-level DM should not be less than that of their lower-level DMs in an MLLP problem. As such, the objective of the first phase is to find the possible maximum satisfaction degrees for all the objective functions, ensuring higher satisfaction degrees for higher-level DMs compared to those of lower-level DMs. The second phase provides an adjustment scheme for each higher-level DM, who can then adjust the resulting satisfaction degrees.

Based on model (1), the coefficients in each objective function are represented as fuzzy numbers in row-vector form. In matrix form, the fuzzy coefficients for all objective functions can be represented as:

                        . Considering the relationship between the DMs at the adjacent two levels in MLLP problems, the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goal for the lower-level DM is usually limited to be less than that of the higher-level DM. In the extreme case, the maximum satisfaction degree of the higher-level DM’s fuzzy goal minimizes the lower-level DM’s satisfaction.

The solutions from model (9) can provide the maximum satisfaction of the overall fuzzy goals, under the condition that each higher-level DM should better satisfy their goal than that of a lower-level DM. However, for some particular cases, this condition cannot be satisfied, due to conflicts between the fuzzy goals of higher- and lower-level DMs, and this makes model (9) infeasible. To deal with this, a pre-check model is provided to examine the feasibility of the constraint

In this situation, the problem cannot be treated as an MLLP one investigated in this study, because it is not possible to find a solution to satisfy these constraints, even when the second phase is applied. However, one way to overcome this problem is to remove the violated constraints based on model (10) from model (9). Then, the optimal solutions satisfying the remaining leader–follower relationship constraints can be obtained as the final solutions.

Based on the solutions from the first phase, DMs can determine the satisfaction degrees of the corresponding fuzzy goals. In the second phase, all the higher-level DMs (

To meet the requirement that the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goal of a DM should be higher than that of the DM at a lower level, an adjustment scheme that considers the decision hierarchy is carried out from the top to bottom sequentially. Each adjustment process, activated by the higher-level DM, is performed by considering two DMs at adjacent levels at a given time. The process is iterative and ends after the lowest level has been considered.

To include the characteristic of vagueness when determining the adjustment of satisfaction degrees, a fuzzy variable of relative satisfaction is defined as

                         is fractionally formulated based on the definition in (11), making the model complex and difficult to solve. To enhance the computational efficiency of solving model (13), the method of variable change [16] is used to linearize the constraint.

This section demonstrates the proposed two-phase approach for MLLP problems with a numerical example. Another example is also provided to illustrate the case where the leader–follower relationship between some leader–follower levels cannot be found, and thus the requirement of a leader–follower relationship in terms of the satisfaction degree of fuzzy goals cannot be met. Comparisons with existing approaches are also presented to show the advantages of the proposed approach. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of the

                         could be adopted as the final solution for all the DMs.

The proposed two-phase approach considers the inherent leader–follower relationship of DMs in a hierarchical decision process, ensuring that the fuzzy goal of a higher-level DM can reach a higher satisfaction degree than that of their lower-level DMs. In contrast, existing approaches [3,11,17,19–23,25] may not guarantee that the leader–follower constraint is met, even though the leader–follower relationships really exist, based on the results of the pre-check model (10). Pramanik and Roy [17] recently developed weighted/unweighted FGP models to solve MLLP problems, without considering the adjustment function for a higher-level DM. To demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach, the proposed model (9) in the first phase is compared to Pramanik and Roy’s models [17] with regard to solving the example, formulated as (18).

In addition, the proposed approach is different from most existing interactive fuzzy approaches for MLLP problems [3,11,19–23,25] that carry out the adjustment of a higher-level DM’s satisfaction by intuitively setting the minimal acceptable satisfaction as the constraint in their models. To compare these two adjustment techniques, this section adopts model (18) of the example, where the solution x
                        =(4.1667,1.1766,0.3234) and the associated satisfaction degrees

This indicates that the effectiveness of the existing techniques may be limited, especially when such a higher-level DM desires to further decrease their satisfaction. These comparisons clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed two-phase fuzzy approach.

                         level may be needed to find an appropriate aspiration level. To this end, a feasible mechanism could be developed to determine an acceptable 
                           
                              α
                           
                         level for all DMs. Using the established fuzzy goals, the proposed two-phase approach can be applied to determine the acceptable satisfaction degree of fuzzy goals and then to obtain a set of final solutions for DMs at various levels.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The confidence level, non-dominated solutions, solution efficiency, and applicability of the proposed method are discussed below.

A specific 
                           
                              α
                           
                         level is adopted in the proposed approach to represent the confidence level on DMs’ subjective uncertainty to specify parameter values in the MLLP problem for determining the optimal solution of each DM’s objective function. For simplification, the confidence levels for all DMs’ fuzzy numbers in the solution processes are considered to be the same. However, these may be limitations in practical applications. The determination of confidence levels for various DMs’ subjective uncertainties could be different in the real world, due to DMs’ different considerations of the corresponding problems. As such, the possibility of using different confidence levels for different DMs could be considered in the future.

The proposed two-phase approach emphasizes that the leader–follower relationship of DMs is essential in a hierarchical decision process, such that the fuzzy goal of a higher-level DM can reach a higher satisfaction degree than that of their lower-level DMs. Consequently, this paper does not deal with MLLP problems in which the leader–follower relationships in terms of the satisfaction degree of fuzzy goal are disrupted. The pre-check model presented in this paper can be employed to check these relationships for the considered MLLP problem. In addition, due to the inherent characteristic of leader–follower relationships in an MLLP problem, the proposed two-phase approach focuses on satisfying the related constraints. The satisfaction of a higher-level DM with regard to their fuzzy goal is important, and this is achieved through a process of compromise and adjustment when solving MLLP problems. As such, the resulting final solutions, satisfied (or accepted) by all higher-level DMs, may not be optimal ones [11,17,25–27].

The iterative adjustment processes are carried out for higher-level DMs in the second phase. The solution in each iteration can be efficiently obtained by employing the derived linear FGP models (16), which are equivalent to model (13). The proposed approach keeps the inherent decision characteristic that higher-level DMs always have power to influence the decisions of their lower-level DMs in the real world. In addition, the first-phase solution will be the final one if the adjustments of relative satisfaction are not necessary for all higher-level DMs. This leads to a simple solution process.

This paper focused on the investigation of MLLP problems to find the satisfactory solution for each DM in a fuzzy environment, in which fuzzy goal programming models were formulated to optimally achieve the relative satisfaction of DMs at the adjacent two levels. Although this paper employed fuzzy approaches similar to those used in the literature [3,11,17,19–23,25], the proposed two-phase fuzzy approach has advantages, as demonstrated. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed fuzzy approach, this paper provided numerical illustrations and comparisons with previous solution models [3,11,17,19–23,25], where the possible disadvantages by applying those existing models are demonstrated. In practical applications, the hierarchical decision structure of a problem should be defined. For example, the corresponding decision variables, constraints, and objective function for each DM at different levels are required to be defined or established to formulate the problem under investigation as an MLLP model. The applications of the proposed method are effective, since the leader–follower requirement and relative satisfactions are considered as the constraints in the first- and second-phase models, i.e., (9.4), (13.4), (13.5), (13.6) and (13.7), so as to guarantee that the satisfactory solution can be obtained. In general, the efficacy of constraint functions in a mathematical programming model is quite strong.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper proposed a two-phase fuzzy approach for MLLP problems. Based on the 
                        
                           α
                        
                      level, a numerical general model was constructed. In the first phase, an FGP model was formulated to find the optimum solution for each fuzzy goal with the restriction that the fuzzy goal of each higher-level DM is more satisfied than that of their lower-level DM. Before solving the first-phase FGP model, a pre-check model is provided to examine whether the leader–follower relationship constraint is violated in an MLLP problem. After examining the solutions from the first phase, a higher-level DM is allowed to adjust the satisfaction of their fuzzy goal in the second phase. The adjustment process is performed sequentially in the hierarchical structure from the top to bottom. A fuzzy variable of the relative satisfaction is used to determine a linguistic term to describe the level of relative satisfaction of each lower-level DM compared to their higher-level DM. By changing the linguistic term to correspond to the desired adjustment, a second-phase FGP model is established and solved for a DM, while maintaining the current satisfaction degrees for the DMs at higher levels. The second-phase solution process terminates after all higher-level DMs are satisfied or accept the solutions. A numerical example and comparisons with existing approaches demonstrated the applicability and good performance of the proposed approach. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of the confidence level on the results.

The proposed two-phase fuzzy approach has several advantages. First, the decision processes meet the leader–follower requirement in the hierarchical structure. The satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goal (or objective function) of each higher-level DM (
                        
                           
                              
                                 DM
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                     ) should not be less than that of their subordinate DM (
                        
                           
                              
                                 DM
                              
                              
                                 i
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                     ) at the next level. Second the adjustment scheme allows a higher-level DM (
                        
                           
                              
                                 DM
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                     ) to tune their satisfaction degree by modifying the relative satisfaction of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 DM
                              
                              
                                 i
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      in sequence. Third, the judgment for the level of the adjustment process is performed using a linguistic term to reflect the uncertainty in the problem. The proposed approach has some limitations. As mentioned in the discussion section, a specific 
                        
                           α
                        
                      level is used in the proposed approach to represent the confidence level for each DM’s subjective uncertainty. This may not reflect each DM’s preference in the decision processes. In addition, only one linear objective function is built for each DM, and only linear constraints are considered in the model, which possibly restrict the representation of the problem to be studied. In future research, a method for determining an acceptable 
                        
                           α
                        
                      level for each DM can be developed. Furthermore, approaches could be investigated for allowing each DM to have several objective functions, which may not be linear.
