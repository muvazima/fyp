                  We consider single-item (r, q) and (s, T) inventory systems with integer-valued demand processes. While most of the inventory literature studies continuous approximations of these models and establishes joint convexity properties of the policy parameters in the continuous space, we show that these properties no longer hold in the discrete space, in the sense of linear interpolation extension and L
                     ♮-convexity. This nonconvexity can lead to failure of optimization techniques based on local optimality to obtain the optimal inventory policies. It can also make certain comparative properties established previously using continuous variables invalid. We revise these properties in the discrete space.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This paper is concerned with two basic single-item inventory systems with integer-valued demand processes. We first investigate the properties of the key performance measures, including the recently developed discrete convexity concepts (see, e.g., Murota, 2003). We then revisit several other properties previously established assuming demand is continuous.

The primary focus of the paper (Sections 2, 3, and 4) is on the continuous-review (r, q) inventory system where r is the reorder point and q is the order quantity. The demand process is a Poisson process with rate λ. Unsatisfied demand is backlogged. The replenishment leadtimes are exogenous and sequential (see Zipkin, 2000, Chapter 7 for detail), having identical distribution as the generic random variable L. This leadtime model includes the constant leadtime as a special case. Let D denote the steady-state leadtime demand, IN the net inventory (=inventory on-hand−backorders), and IP the inventory position (outstanding orders+net inventory), respectively. Then IN
                     =
                     IP
                     −
                     D, and IP is uniformly distributed on {r
                     +1,…,
                     r
                     +
                     q}, which is independent of D. Consequently, the average number of backorders is

                     To find the optimal (r
                     ∗, q
                     ∗) that minimizes C(r, q), a natural and traditional approach is to establish the joint convexity of C in (r, q), so that a local optimum is guaranteed to be globally optimal – a property we call Property LG for short – and therefore a global optimum can be found by descent algorithms. However, while the notion of convexity has long been established for functions on the real vector space, it was not so for functions defined on the integer vector space (termed discrete convexity) until more recently (see, e.g., Murota, 2003). This partly explains why in the inventory literature most studies on the properties of (r, q) systems assume continuous demands (Hariga and Ben-Daya, 1999; Hill, 1996; Hill et al., 2007; Jassen et al., 1998). It was also argued that the cost function for continuous demands can be an adequate approximation of the cost function for discrete demands only when the order quantity q is large enough (Zheng, 1992).

For the continuous-demand model, it was shown that, as long as the cumulative demand is a nondecreasing stochastic process with stationary increments and continuous sample paths, IP is uniformly distributed on the interval (r, r
                     +
                     q], and D and IP are independent of each other (Serfozo and Stidham, 1978; Zipkin, 1986). Under these conditions, Zipkin (1986) proves that B(r, q) and I(r, q) are jointly convex in (r, q). His proof is given by explicitly expressing B(r, q) in terms of integrations involving the probability distribution function of D, taking second partial derivatives and then showing the Hessian matrix is nonnegative definite. Zhang (1998) provides a simpler proof for the same result. One essential step of Zhang’s proof is that IP has a continuous uniform distribution. Based on the joint convexity results, Zheng (1992) develops a geometric intuitive optimality condition for the continuous (r, q) system and compares the exact optimal solution with the approximate solution obtained from using the EOQ formula. He shows that the EOQ heuristic is a lower bound on the optimal order quantity and the relative cost error by employing this heuristic is bounded by 1/8=0.125. This error bound has subsequently been improved by Axsäter (1996) to

                      and by Gallego (1998) to 0.0607 for a variant of the EOQ heuristic. Rao (2003) extends the above convexity results and sensitivity analysis to the continuous-time, continuous-demand (s, T) system with compound Poisson and Brownian motion demand processes. Liu and Song (2012) revisit Rao’s convexity results.

Given the significant role joint convexity played in the analysis of continuous-demand models, it is natural to investigate whether similar properties still hold for the discrete counterparts. This is especially important when q and T are small so the continuous-demand approximation is not effective. Note that when these policy parameters take integer values, the methods employed by the above mentioned works for continuous models are no longer valid, so direct verification of discrete convexity is needed. It is also worth mentioning that there are some other recent applications of discrete convexity concepts and their continuous extensions in inventory models, which have greatly enhanced our understanding on the structural properties of these systems. See, for example, Lu and Song (2005) and Nadar et al. (2011) on assemble-to-order systems, Zipkin (2008) and Huh and Janakiraman (2010) on lost-sales models, Pang et al. (2012) on joint inventory-pricing problems, and Li and Yu (2011) on perishable inventory systems. Our findings in the two basic single-item batch ordering systems complement these studies and provide insights for future studies on the structural properties of these systems.

We employ two notions of discrete convexity that guarantee Property LG. The first is the convexity of the linear interpolation of the discrete functions; it is also known as equivalent to multimodularity. The second is L
                     ♮-convexity. From the definitions of these two notions (see details in Section 2), neither one of them can imply the other. However, Murota (2005) shows that the two properties are equivalent subject to a unimodular coordinate transformation. That is, a multimodular function can be represented by a L
                     ♮-convex function through a unimodular coordinate transformation, and vice versa. In our analysis, we do not make such transformations.

In Section 2, we show that B(r, q), I(r, q) and C(r, q) are not jointly convex in the sense of linear interpolation extension or in the sense of L
                     ♮-convexity, although some other structural properties hold. To make better connection to the familiar continuous model and to gain deeper insight, we also explore the L
                     ♮-convex properties of the continuous (r, q) system. In Section 3, we show that properties established in the literature for the continuous (r, q) model no longer hold in the discrete system. Correspondingly, we develop related properties for the discrete model. In Section 4, we extend our findings to the periodic-review (s, T) system with a Poisson demand, where T is the reorder interval and s is the order-up-to level. Other features are similar to the (r, q) system. Due to space concerns, some proofs are placed in Appendix A.

For comparison purposes, for any function X in the discrete (r, q) system, we use

In this section, we examine two notions on discrete convexity that assures Property LG, i.e., guarantees local optimality to be global optimality. Before introducing these notions, we first define some notations and present some preliminaries.

Unfortunately, our finding is,
                           Proposition 1
                           
                              The functions B(r, q), I(r, q) and C(r, q) are not jointly convex in the sense of linear interpolation extension, or, equivalently, not multimodular.
                           

In order to show from Lemma 2 that B(r, q) is not jointly convex in the sense of linear interpolation extension, it is sufficient to prove that there exists

In this subsection, we look at another notion of discrete convexity that assures Property LG – L
                        ♮-convexity (see Murota, 2003). Among several equivalent characterizations of L

It has been shown in both theory and practice that, sometimes although a function is not L
                        ♮-convex in its original coordinates, it is L
                        ♮-convex after a coordinate transformation. For this reason, we are also interested in studying natural linear transformations of the policy variables in the (r, q) system. Let s

                                       are jointly convex and submodular. Their Hessian matrices are diagonally dominant for the variable s but not for the variable q. They are not L
                                       ♮
                                       -convex.
                                    

Thus, the average cost of the continuous (r, q) model is not L
                        ♮-convex, even though it is jointly convex. This implies that while joint convexity in the continuous model is sufficient for Property LG, we need several more properties of the cost function when we optimize in the discrete space and therefore it is much harder to achieve. The proposition also reveals exactly which properties of the L
                        ♮-convexity break down in the (r, q) model. In addition, note that for continuous demand, Zipkin (2008) shows that, in the single-item lost-sales model, while the original single-stage lost-sales systems do not necessarily possess L
                        ♮-convexity, certain linear transformation of the state variables creates the property. Huh and Janakiraman (2010) extend this finding to the serial lost-sales systems, and Pang et al. (2012) show similar properties in the inventory-pricing problem. Unfortunately, our results above show that the natural linear transformations of the policy variables in the continuous (r, q) system also fail to possess L
                        ♮-convexity.

                        Result (ib) implies that r(q) is nonincreasing in q and q(r) is nonincreasing in r. Similar implications apply to parts (ii) and (iii). In addition, by the definition of L
                        ♮-convexity, the parts (ic) and (iic) are immediate from (ib) and (iib), respectively. Thus, in the discrete space too, both the original (r, q) system and the natural linear transformations do not possess L
                        ♮-convexity.

Due to its closed-form solution and robustness, the EOQ formula is often used as a heuristic order quantity in (r, q) systems even though it assumes deterministic demand. So, it is of interest to study how the EOQ model compares to the stochastic model.

When demand is deterministic, the long-run average cost is given by (3) with G(y) replaced by

For discrete demand, the continuous-demand cost function (5) is an adequate approximation of (3) only when the order quantity q is not too small. In this case, it is reasonable to apply Lemma 5. Otherwise, this assertion may not be reliable. Indeed, we found counterexamples, which are presented in the next section.

Note that the EOQ order quantity q
                        
                           e
                         may not be an integer, so the first question is how to adapt the EOQ-based heuristic to the discrete model. Natural choices are ⌈q
                        
                           e
                        ⌉ and ⌊q
                        
                           e
                        ⌋. (Gallego, 1998 has a similar discussion and suggestion.) The following two examples show Lemma 5 fail to hold for both choices.

Recall that in the continuous model, q
                        
                           e
                         is the optimal order quantity when demand is deterministic. So, Lemma 5 compares the result of the stochastic system with its deterministic counterpart. Thus, it is interesting to see whether such a comparison carries through in the discrete model, i.e., whether Lemma 5 holds if we replace q

We now aim to revise the properties in Lemma 5 for the discrete system. To see these properties, it is important to review how to determine (r
                        ∗, q
                        ∗) and (r
                        0, q
                        0). We use the method given by Federgruen and Zheng (1992), which is based on the fact that −G(y) is unimodal. Let y
                        1 be the smallest integer that minimizes G(·) over all integers. Assuming that {y
                        1,…,
                        y

                        ⌋−1 as an EOQ-based heuristic order quantity for the discrete system, we can view Proposition 4 (ii) and Proposition 5 (ii) as the discrete version of Lemma 5 in terms of assessing the effectiveness of the EOQ-based heuristic. Similarly, Proposition 4 (i) and Proposition 5 (i) are the discrete counterparts of Lemma 5 in terms of assessing the impact of ignoring demand variability.

We now examine the discrete periodic-review (s, T) inventory system. Here, the inventory position IP(t) is reviewed every T periods. If, upon review, IP(t) is below s, then order enough to bring IP(t) back to s; otherwise, do nothing. The demand process is a Poisson process with per-period demand rate λ. That is, let D(1) denote the demand for one period, then D(1) has a Poisson distribution with parameter λ. The leadtime for each replenishment order is assumed to be a positive integer ℓ. There is a fixed order cost K, a per-period unit inventory holding cost h, and a per-period unit backorder cost p. Note that the cumulative demand in t-periods, denoted by D(t), has a Poisson distribution with parameter λt.

                           The function

                                 s

                           for the discrete system is not convex in the sense of linear interpolation extension nor in the sense of L
                           ♮
                           -convexity.
                        

The proof of the proposition is similar to the proof of Proposition 1, and is given in Appendix A. Furthermore, we have the following result which is the discrete version of that in Liu and Song (2012).

For any fixed T, the convexity of

                           By Example 8.A.2 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007), we know that the Poisson process D(t) is stochastically increasing and linear (SIL). Noting that for any fixed s, the function (t
                           −
                           s)+ is an increasing convex in t, thus, by Theorem 8.A.17 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007) and (30), to get the convexity of

                            in T, it suffices to show that the uniform distribution U(T) is also SIL. To the end, for any increasing convex (concave) function g(·) defined on {0,1,2,…}, we need to show that

                           +1) is stochastically larger than U(T), it is straightforward to see the monotonicity of E
                           g(U(T)). Here we only consider the convexity of E
                           g(U(T)) when g(·) is convex. The concavity for the case in which g(·) is concave can be proved similarly. It is sufficient to show that

                        Proof of Proposition 3
                        First, we prove (ia). For any fixed q, the convexity in r can be found in Chapter 6 of Zipkin (2000). We now argue that for any fixed r, these functions are convex in q. Here we only give the proof for B(r, q), from which the results for I(r, q) and C(r, q) follow directly due to (2) and (3). For any fixed t, from Lemma 1 (iii),

For part (iia), because linear transformation preserves convexity, all these measures are componentwise convex. For (iib), similar to the above, we only consider

                           Here we only prove (ii) for the case (47). The other case can be handled similarly.

First, we prove ⌊q
                           
                              e

                           0. Let n
                           =⌊q
                           
                              e
                           ⌋−2. In view of (17), we only need to prove that

                           (iii) directly follows from the fact that f

                           1(3)=2/3.
