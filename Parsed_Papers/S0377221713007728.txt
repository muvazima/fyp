                  Most classical scheduling research assumes that the objectives sought are common to all jobs to be scheduled. However, many real-life applications can be modeled by considering different sets of jobs, each one with its own objective(s), and an increasing number of papers addressing these problems has appeared over the last few years. Since so far the area lacks a unified view, the studied problems have received different names (such as interfering jobs, multi-agent scheduling, and mixed-criteria), some authors do not seem to be aware of important contributions in related problems, and solution procedures are often developed without taking into account existing ones. Therefore, the topic is in need of a common framework that allows for a systematic recollection of existing contributions, as well as a clear definition of the main research avenues. In this paper we review multicriteria scheduling problems involving two or more sets of jobs and propose an unified framework providing a common definition, name and notation for these problems. Moreover, we systematically review and classify the existing contributions in terms of the complexity of the problems and the proposed solution procedures, discuss the main advances, and point out future research lines in the topic.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The existence of several objectives is consubstantial to scheduling problems, as it can be seen from different definitions of the field, such as Pinedo (1995), where scheduling is defined as a decision-making process that has as a goal the optimization of one or more objectives. Therefore, it is not surprising that multicriteria scheduling problems have been widely studied in the scheduling literature (see e.g. the reviews by Hoogeveen, 2005; Minella, Ruiz, & Ciavotta, 2008; T’kindt & Billaut, 2001, 2002). In all the problems analyzed in these surveys the criteria considered affect all jobs to be scheduled. Only Hoogeveen (2005) mentions the case of multicriteria scheduling problems with two or more sets of jobs. In these problems, two or more sets of jobs (not necessarily disjoint) have to be scheduled, each one with its own objective(s). Although this is a special case of multicriteria scheduling problems, the existence of several sets makes the problems rather different than their one-set counterpart as, in general, the complexity of these problems changes even if the objective functions are the same (Agnetis, Mirchandani, Pacciarelli, & Pacifici, 2004).

As discussed later in this paper, this type of scheduling problems arise in a number of real-life applications and therefore have been subject of interest by researchers and practitioners in the last few years. However, the lack of a unified framework has been a major deterrent for research advances in the field. There is not even a common name which has caused some contributions to ignore past works on the topic, as the keywords and title of the existing results make it difficult to conduct an extensive search (for instance, the same conclusion regarding a specific problem is independently shown by Agnetis, Pacciarelli, & Pacifici, 2007a,chap. 2; Nong, Cheng, & Ng, 2011). Without a common definition and name, the notation and limits for this kind of problems are not clear, which may have hidden valuable contributions and makes the comparison among similar problems very difficult. In addition, this has caused that some scheduling problems dealing with two types of jobs, but with no interference among them, were considered part of the topic. For instance, in some problems described in Leung, Pinedo, and Wan (2010), the jobs in one set have their due date to be equal to their release date plus their processing times. Therefore, these jobs have to be processed in a specific (fixed) time interval and the remaining scheduling problem is how to schedule the jobs in the other set, which can be assimilated to a traditional scheduling problem with machine unavailability.

In this paper we will try to move towards an unified view on the topic that allows overcoming the above problems. More specifically, we (1) discuss the different definitions and approaches for the problem and provide a framework consisting of a single definition and notation, (2) give some complexity results and general properties, (3) review and classify the different contributions and results on the topic based on the aforementioned framework, and (4) point out the main research avenues in the field. By doing so, we expect to foster the research in this interesting and challenging scheduling area.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the problems, their applications and the different names used in the literature. In Section 3 we present the notation and adapt the taxonomy presented by T’kindt and Billaut (2002) for multicriteria scheduling problems. The relationship among the complexities, single criteria and multicriteria scheduling problems is outlined in Section 4, where some general properties are presented as well. Literature is reviewed by classifying the problems into basic problems (discussed in Section 5) if there are no conditions for the machines or jobs, i.e. the most general case indicating only the machine environment and the objectives considered for each set of jobs; and extended problems (discussed in Section 6), where specific conditions are imposed. Finally, Section 7 contains the conclusions and future research lines.

We consider two or more set of jobs – not necessarily disjoint – competing or using common processing resources (machines). Each set of jobs has one objective, which may or may not be the same for each set. The objectives of some sets have to be optimized while others have to satisfy one or more constraints. This type of scheduling problems arise from many real-life fields of application (see Mor & Mosheiov, 2010):
                        
                           •
                           
                              Supply chain scheduling: In a supply chain, a classical problem is to minimize overall manufacturing and distribution costs integrating production and delivery. If the customers are competing for a common processing resource then the problem implies interfering jobs. Fan (2010) presents a scheduling problem where the customers are placed at different locations such that delivery times are given. The objective is to minimize the sum of time between job’s release and the delivery to the corresponding customer.


                              Rescheduling: Rescheduling can be defined as the process of updating an existing production schedule in response to disruptions or other changes (Herrmann, 2006, chap. 6), such as the arrival of new jobs to be processed. Rescheduling usually implies more than one set of jobs, so a standard rescheduling problem can be formulated as a two-agent scheduling problem (Leung et al., 2010). In this problem there are usually two sets of jobs: existing jobs which have been already scheduled and new jobs to be scheduled. In this problem, two cases may be distinguished (Pinedo, 1995):
                                 
                                    –
                                    The starting times of the existing jobs cannot be modified (‘frozen’ jobs), so the problem can be considered as a single criteria problem subject to machine/job availability constraints (see e.g. Perez-Gonzalez & Framinan, 2009, 2010a; Perez-Gonzalez, Framinan, & Molina Pariente, 2011).

The starting times of the existing jobs can be modified (existing jobs can be rescheduled). If the same objective is considered both for existing and incoming jobs, the problem is again a scheduling problem with one set of jobs. However, in many situations it makes sense to employ different objectives for each set: Some performance measure is minimized for incoming jobs in order to obtain a short completion time for this set of jobs (e.g. minimizing their makespan or flowtime), while the objective for the existing jobs aims to minimize the disruption from their initial schedule. The usual way to achieve the latter objective is either to minimize their tardiness or impose that these jobs cannot be tardy (see e.g. Perez-Gonzalez & Framinan, 2010b; Unal, Uzsoy, & Kiran, 1997); or to consider special disruption measures as the differences between the completion times of the old jobs in the sequence before rescheduling and the new sequence (such as in e.g. Hall & Potts, 2004; Mu & Gu, 2010; Yuan & Mu, 2007; Yuan, Mu, Lu, & Li, 2007).


                              Telecommunications: Packet-switching networks usually support different applications, each one requiring the transmission of data packages that must reach their destination within some time limit. The most important performance objective for some applications (such as file transfer or interprocess communication) is not to exceed certain mean delay, while for other applications (such as voice or video) is to achieve a specific loss rate. Therefore, the idea of several sets of jobs (packets belonging to applications) that must compete for the use of the same resource (the bandwidth) arises naturally. This problems have been addressed by Peha and Tobagi (1990), Peha (1995), and Meiners and Torng (2007). A similar problem is found in Arbib, Smriglio, and Servilio (2004) for internet protocols, where one user wants to maximize the on-time packets transmitted to other user, while guaranteeing certain amounts of on-time packets to a third user.


                              Maintenance scheduling: Some references in the literature address problems about scheduling jobs and preventive maintenance simultaneously (see e.g. Cassady & Kutanoglu, 2003; Ruiz, Carlos Garcia-Diaz, & Maroto, 2007), considering only one criteria for the jobs. However, since production and maintenance have common resources (the machines) and their activities are actually often conflicting, integrated production and maintenance cooperative scheduling is an example of interfering job problems when we consider a multiobjective approach. Khelifati and Bouzid-Sitayeb (2011a) simultaneously address the problem of scheduling production and preventive maintenance operations, taking into account both production and maintenance criteria. Since most machines have to be maintained at regular intervals (i.e. they require given periods of time on each machine), maintenance tasks can be modeled as maintenance jobs to be scheduled along with production jobs. Since maintenance tasks have to be performed within a time window, each maintenance job has both a release date and a due date (representing the earliest and latest time for the task, respectively). The natural objective for scheduling the set of maintenance jobs is thus to minimize a function of the deviation from their release and due dates, while production jobs are scheduled to minimize some performance measure. This approach is adopted by Wan, Vakati, Leung, and Pinedo (2010). Kellerer and Strusevich (2010) give an interpretation of their specific interfering job problem where machine(s) is(are) subject to a compulsory maintenance during the planning period, the length and the deadline of the maintenance operations are given, and the Decision Maker has to decide when to start the maintenance period, while an objective related to the jobs has to be minimized.

It is to note that, there are several papers focusing on game theory aspects of the problems and its applications in industrial management, project scheduling, queuing setting, telecommunication services, economic markets, scheduling of trains, etc. These papers are originally cited in Agnetis, Mirchandani, Pacciarelli, and Pacifici (2000), Agnetis et al. (2004, 2007a, chap. 2), and Agnetis, Pacciarelli, and Pacifici (2007b), and they are subsequently cited often by authors dealing with interfering jobs scheduling problems, but it is to note that problems addressed there are not interfering jobs problems, at least in view of the definition given here. This is (another) side effect of the lack of a common framework for the topic.

Regarding the name employed to denote this type of problems, different authors have used different denominations:
                        
                           •
                           
                              Peha (1995) call heterogenous-criteria scheduling to the problems where jobs are divided in two classes, and the performance measure differs from class to class. Earlier, Peha and Tobagi (1990) call heterogeneous performance objectives to the same problem, but without an explicit definition.

The term interfering job sets first appeared in the review about multicriteria scheduling by Hoogeveen (2005), defined as a scheduling problem with two sets of jobs competing for processing on a single machine. Interfering job sets or Interfering jobs were later used by Balasubramanian, Fowler, Keha, and Pfund (2009), Elvikis, Hamacher, and T’kindt (2009), Elvikis, Hamacher, and T’kindt (2010b), and Huynh-Tuong and Soukhal (2009a, 2009b, 2010) in the multi-machine context. Their definitions are not homogeneous: In the first reference, the definition expresses that the jobs belong to disjoint classes or sets with a criterion associated with each set, while for the latter authors the sets are not disjoint, and there is an objective function for all jobs subject to minimizing another objective function for a subset of jobs, calling this case global objective function (Huynh-Tuong, Soukhal, & Billaut, 2011; Sadi, Soukhal, & Billaut, 2012).

The most extended name is two agent or multi agent scheduling problems. In some cases it is called competing agents (Agnetis et al., 2004; Agnetis, De Pascale, & Pacciarelli, 2009; Ding & Sun, 2011; Fan, 2010; Huynh-Tuong, Soukhal, & Billaut, 2010; Kellerer & Strusevich, 2010; Mor & Mosheiov, 2010, 2011), being the main keyword agent. This concept was introduced by Agnetis et al. (2004) when addressing a scheduling problem in which two agents compete to perform their respective jobs on a common processing resource, each agent minimizing an objective function depending exclusively on the completion times of its jobs.

In addition, other – less employed – names have been suggested, such as ‘competing users’ (Agnetis et al., 2000; Shen, 1998), ‘customers’ (Baker & Smith, 2003), ‘multiple job classes’ (Soltani, Jolai, & Zandieh, 2010), ‘multi-users’ (Saule & Trystram, 2009), ‘two families of jobs’ (Yuan, Shang, & Feng, 2005), ‘mixed criteria scheduling problem’ (Meiners & Torng, 2007), or even ‘scheduling problem with a floating machine non-availability interval’ (Kellerer & Strusevich, 2010), motivated by the fact that there is a machine maintenance interval which is not fixed. Finally, Arbib et al. (2004) do not give a name for the problem.

When trying to consolidate a name for the problem, it does not sound logic to choose one of these aforementioned less-employed names. Besides, multi-customer or multi-users do not imply a multicriteria problem, and ‘class’ or ‘family’ of jobs are terms used generally for batch scheduling which may be confusing. Similarly, ‘heterogeneous criteria’ and ‘mixed criteria scheduling problem’ imply different criteria for each set of jobs, so the case when the sets have the same objective is not considered.

While agent is the most extended name, we think that it could also be confusing, as there is an extensive literature on scheduling with multi-agent systems without relationship with our problem (see e.g. Coudert, Grabot, & Archimede, 2002; Shen, Hao, Yoon, & Norrie, 2006). Multi-agent system is a subfield of Distributed Artificial Intelligence where a network of individual agents share knowledge and communicate with each other to solve a problem beyond the scope of a single agent (Balaji & Srinivasan, 2010, chap. 1). This approach can be applied to scheduling in order to solve problems with competitive and negotiating algorithms controlled by agents (see e.g. Khelifati & Bouzid-Sitayeb, 2011a), but many references do not consider two or more set of jobs to be scheduled.

Finally, the term sets (or classes, or families) of jobs could be adopted, but it must be taken into account that there may be problems with several sets of jobs that do not necessarily compete for a resource, even if they have different objectives, and that these scheduling problem could be disaggregated into two single-criterion scheduling sub-problems.

Regardless if each job belongs to an agent, is a part of a customer order, an operation of a department or user, belongs to disjoint sets or not, etc. the key feature is that the job interferes with other jobs for the same resources. Although we think that interfering jobs is the most suitable term to name our problem, the most employed is multi-agent scheduling problem (MASP) so it is the term selected.

In the next section, we provide a common notation and taxonomy for these problems.

A classification for MASPs can be obtained extending on the standard triplet α∣β∣γ notation by Graham, Lawler, Lenstra, and Rinnooy Kan (1979) (see Pinedo, 1995 for a complete description). The α field represents the machine environment, i.e. including the single machine (1), identical machines in parallel (Pm), machines in parallel with different speeds (Qm), unrelated machines in parallel (Rm), flowshop (Fm), jobshop (Jm), or openshop (Om). We denote the case of the permutation flowshop (PFm) in order to obtain a clearer taxonomy of the problems with an empty β field (in the standard notation, the permutation condition in flowshops is indicated in the field β by the notation prmu).


                     β indicates conditions applying to jobs. If a condition is applied only in some sets, then it is indicated by a super-index. Usual restrictions are:

Processing-times-related conditions: Such as preemption (prmp); learning effect (learning)/deteriorating jobs (deteriorating) i.e. processing times decrease/increase with the starting time or the position of the job in σ; controlable processing times (ctrl), i.e.

Batch-related constraints (batch): Parallel batch (p-batch) indicates that a machine can process up to b jobs simultaneously, being the processing time of a batch equal to the largest processing time of the jobs in the batch. In serial batching (s-batch), jobs are processed sequentially with a setup time for each batch (i.e. setup time between two jobs is equal to zero if both jobs are scheduled in the same batch). This case is also called family/part type-dependent setup times, including the case where a family is determined by a set of jobs. There may be batch capacity restrictions (denoted as b
                              ⩽
                              x, otherwise we assume b
                              =∞), where each job has a size size

                              . Finally, there may be incompatible sets (IS) if jobs from different sets cannot be placed in the same batch.

Availability constraints: A case treated in the literature is that of forbidden intervals (I), denoting a time interval where no jobs can be scheduled. The number of forbidden intervals is denoted by n
                              ∗.

Precedence: This condition can be applied to machines or jobs: Machine precedence is denoted as m

Depending on the approach, machine setting, objective function, etc., there are many different problems in the literature. A broad classification is to divide the problems into basic problems (i.e. when there are no conditions for the machines or jobs, i.e. the most general case indicating only the machine environment and the objectives considered for each set of jobs) and extended problems (i.e. where specific conditions are imposed). Prior to this classification, it is useful to recall the complexity of the different problems and to derive general properties that may apply to some approaches. Both aspects are discussed in the next section.

Many contributions in the literature about MASPs are devoted to classify and/or determine the complexity of different problems. In the same way as in single criterion and classical multicriteria scheduling problems, the complexities of some MASPs can be determined by reductions to known problems. In this subsection we intend to give a first step to determine the relationship between the complexities of MASPs and known problems.

Complexity theory is based on languages theory and Turing machines (see Garey & Johnson, 1979). A problem belongs to a class of complexity, which informs us of the complexity of the “best algorithm” able to solve it (T’kindt & Billaut, 2002). We know the complexity of a problem if it can be reduced from/to another problem with a known complexity. A search (decision) problem π′ is NP-hard (NP-complete) if and only if another search (decision) problem π is NP-hard (NP-complete) and a reduction of π towards π′ exists. The problem π′ is at least as difficult to solve as the problem π. NP-hard problems are also called NP-hard in the ordinary sense, ordinary NP-hard, binary NP-hard problems, or weakly NP-hard. A subclass of NP-hard problems are the so-called strongly NP-hard problems (NP-hard in the strong sense or unary NP-hard). For detailed definitions we refer the reader to Garey and Johnson (1979), Gawiejnowicz (2008), and T’kindt and Billaut (2002).

In order to establish the relationship among the complexities of single-criterion, multicriteria and MASPs, we use the following notation:

The special case of an MASP when all sets of jobs except one are empty is a single-criterion scheduling problem. T’kindt and Billaut (2002) (pp. 39–42) give a complete study about the complexities of single-criterion scheduling problems, providing the reduction trees depending on the machine setting, on the constraints and criteria. Since reduction tree of machine settings and reduction tree of constraints can be applied to multicriteria problems as well as to MASPs, they are not discussed here. Note that the latter allow us to identify the relationship among the complexities of basic and some simple cases of extended problems (under the same machine and criteria conditions). However, application of the reduction tree of criteria to multicriteria and therefore, to MASPs is not direct, since it depends on the approach.

Within each approach, reductions can be developed whenever we consider two problems in which all sets (except one) involve the same objective functions, i.e. if α∣β∣f is reduced from α∣β∣g, then problem α∣β∣*(f
                           1,…,
                           f
                           
                              k
                           ,…,
                           f
                           
                              K
                           ) is reduced from α∣β∣*(f
                           1,…,
                           g
                           
                              k
                           ,…,
                           f
                           
                              K
                           ). Note that if all K sets in each problem have the same function, then α∣β∣*(f
                           1,…,
                           f
                           
                              k
                           ,…,
                           f
                           
                              K
                           ) is reduced from α∣β∣*(g
                           1,…,
                           g
                           
                              k
                           ,…,
                           g
                           
                              K
                           ).

Another special case of MASPs is when all sets of jobs are equal. Then, the problem is equivalent to a standard multicriteria scheduling problem. However, there are more MASPs than multicriteria scheduling problems, since it does not make sense to consider multicriteria problems for the ∊-constraint and LCC approaches with equal objectives, while the multi-agent counterpart is well-defined.

The relationship among the complexities of the different approaches is the same for multicriteria scheduling problems than for MASPs. We have adapted the reduction tree of multicriteria problems given by T’kindt and Billaut (2002) to MASPs (see Fig. 1
                           , where a solid arrow from problem A to problem B indicates that a reduction exists from A to B). As it is possible to associate a decision problem with an optimization problem, the relation among their complexities is represented in Fig. 1 by dotted arrows. Therefore, the complexity of most problems concerning the goal programming approach are a straightforward consequence of the corresponding ∊-constraint version.

Although the reduction tree for multicriteria and MASPs is the same, in general, the complexities of the MASPs are not the same as that of the corresponding multicriteria problems even if the objective functions are the same (Agnetis et al., 2004). Agnetis et al. (2004) give some examples where the complexities are not the same in the case of basic problems of the ∊-constraint approach. Therefore, the tables with the complexities for bicriteria basic problems for LCC, Lexicographical and ∊-constraint approaches provided by T’kindt and Billaut (2002) (pp. 116, 117) do not apply for MASPs. However, for the special case of MASPs with global objective, Huynh-Tuong et al. (2011) develop some reductions to these problems from single-criterion, bicriteria and MASPs with two disjoint sets of jobs. Only ∊-constraint and LCC approaches have been considered. The reductions have been adapted for general cases with more than two objective functions in Fig. 2
                           , where solid arrow applies for regular measures, and dashed arrow implies reductions for objective functions belonging to the set

An algorithm is a finite procedure that finds a solution to an arbitrary instance of a problem. In the literature, there are different methods to solve scheduling problems. Gawiejnowicz (2008), for example, presents a classification of different types of algorithms applied to scheduling in the literature (in particular to time-dependent scheduling problems), which can be extended to scheduling problem in general, and to MASPs in particular: Exact algorithms find the exact solution of a problem (not only feasible solutions). Polynomial-time algorithms are examples of exact algorithms that find the exact solution in polynomial-time. For the problems for which no polynomial-time algorithms are known, exact solutions can be found by enumerative, branch-and-bound (B&B) or dynamic programming algorithms. Pseudopoynomial-time algorithms are applied to NP-hard problems, and, in general, a problem which is strongly NP-hard cannot be solved by them. Approximation algorithms are polynomial algorithms that generate an approximate solution that is close to an optimal solution, measured by the worst-case ratio (approximation ratio), which is a number in single criterion problems. In multicriteria and MASPs with Pareto and Goal Programming approaches and objectives (f

                           )-approximation schedule is the schedule which provides an approximation ratio of β
                           
                              k
                            for objective f
                           
                              k
                            (see e.g. Lee, Choi, Leung, & Pinedo (2009) and Saule & Trystram (2009)). A family of approximation algorithms which generate solutions as close to the optimal one as desired is called an approximation scheme. There exist two types of approximation schemata: polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) and fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS). Finally, Heuristics and Metaheuristics are algorithms with unknown worst-case ratio. It is not possible to predict the behavior of this algorithm for all instances and their efficiency is evaluated by computational experiments. Some examples found in the MASP literature are Genetic Algorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Tabu Search (TS), Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), or Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).

All previous methods can be applied to MASPs regardless the approach. However, the Pareto approach is the most difficult (see Fig. 1), and it is not easy to find methods to determine the set of Pareto optima for MASPs. Usually, a straightforward way is to solve repeatedly instances of the corresponding ∊-constraint problem for decreasing values of ∊ (for example, see Agnetis et al., 2004; Elvikis, Hamacher, & T’kindt, 2010a, 2009). Theoretically, an optimal solution to the ∊-constraint problem is a weak Pareto optimum. However, it is possible to assign an ∊ value to each strict Pareto optimum that it is an optimal solution to the associated ∊-constraint problem (Ehrgott, 2005). For example, if we consider an MASP with two disjoint sets of jobs on a single machine, the problem of finding one schedule which is also non-dominated among the optimal schedules of the ∊-constraint version can be always addressed by binary search (Agnetis et al., 2004).

In some cases, only the cardinality (size) of the set of Pareto optima is provided. This size depends on the specific problem, and it can be polynomially bounded or not. Note that, when the number of tardy jobs is considered at least for one set of jobs, it is clear that the number of non-dominated schedules is linear.


                           Agnetis et al. (2004) give a scheme for enumerating the set of Pareto optima when the problem involves two sets of jobs on a single machine. Fig. 3
                            presents a generalization of this scheme for K sets of jobs, 1∥∊(f

                              K
                           , and a given vector δ
                           =(δ
                           2,…,
                           δ

                           ) with δ

                           =2,…,
                           K. This method depends on the corresponding ∊-constraint problem, and when it is polynomially solvable, the scheme turns out to be polynomial for those problems with a polynomial number of Pareto optima. Then, this method provides a way to determine the cardinality of the set of Pareto optima in some cases.

For certain types of MASPs, some properties on the structure of their optimal solutions can be proved. Some of these properties have been proved by Baker and Smith (2003) for single machine MASPs. Baker and Smith (2003) consider only the LCC approach and some regular performance measures. Here we provide a generalization of these properties for all approaches and regular performance measures. Standard proofs by contradiction apply. These properties may be a starting point to study more complex problems (different layouts or extended problems) to determine their complexities and even to be applied to solution methods (exact or approximate) to solve these problems.

The starting point for obtaining these properties is the problem 1∥max
                        C
                        
                           j
                        , since any job sequence provides the same makespan, and therefore, all schedules are optimal. Consequently, it can be observed that this objective does not have influence on the solution of multicriteria problems and MASPs with two non-disjoint sets and makespan for the global objective function. Then, these problems have the same complexity as the single criterion problem for the other objective. For the rest of the cases, the complexity of MASPs considering makespan for some set 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    J

                         depends on the approach selected. The following properties are related to the sequences of jobs in optimal solutions according to the regular performance measures selected:

Based on this property, it can be observed that the complexity of any MASP with LCC approach for two disjoint sets of jobs and makespan as one of the criteria is the same as the corresponding single criterion problem for the second criterion (Baker & Smith, 2003). This result can be generalized as follows: the complexity of any MASP with LCC approach for more than two disjoint sets of jobs and makespan criterion for

                                    k
                                 
                              
                           
                         is the same as the corresponding problem without the kth set (Cheng, Ng, & Yuan, 2008).

However, for the ∊-constraint approach (and consequently for the Pareto approach) the problems cannot be reduced from the single criterion case even for two sets of jobs. For example,

In this section we review basic problems where no conditions on machines or jobs are imposed (i.e. the field β is empty) and the problems have the form α∥γ. We classify the problems in disjoint and non-disjoint sets of jobs. The former case can be known as competing sets of jobs, and the latter as interfering sets of jobs.

For each case, we classify the problems according to the approach: LCC, ∊-constraints and Pareto. Some results about the GP approach are included whenever appropriate.

In most of the problems addressed in this approach, the layout is the one-machine case. Complexities for two sets of jobs are summarized in Table 2
                            where f
                           
                              A
                            and f
                           
                              B
                            are regular functions. As the problem is symmetric, we have indicated the complexities in the upper part of a triangular matrix. These problems have been studied by Baker and Smith (2003), Yuan et al. (2005), Agnetis et al. (2007a, chap. 2) and Soltani et al. (2010).

In this section, we review the problem when the sets of jobs are disjoint considering the ∊-constraint approach. Most studies are devoted to one-machine layout and two sets of jobs. Table 3
                            summarizes the complexities for 1∥∊(f

                              A
                            and f

                            are regular functions. For the single machine case, Agnetis et al. (2004) proved that the symmetric problems are equivalent, since it is possible to reduce 1∥∊(f

Then, in the same way that the LCC approach, we have indicated the complexities in the upper part of a triangular matrix. These problems have been studied by Agnetis et al. (2004), Ng et al. (2006), Agnetis et al. (2007a, chap. 2), Agnetis, De Pascale, and Pacciarelli (2009), and Leung et al. (2010).

                            is addressed by Kellerer and Strusevich (2010) by means of an FPTAS. They show it to be equivalent to a single criterion problem with one fixed non-availability machine interval in the case that the non-availability is resumable and the total weighted completion time as objective.

                            is proved to be strongly NP-complete by Cheng et al. (2006). These authors present an FPTAS for the problem and prove that it is polynomial when K is arbitrary and the weights and epsilon values of all sets are positive integers. Related to the latter problem, Agnetis et al. (2007a, chap. 2, 2007b) obtain a

                            are given by Mu and Gu (2010). The rest of the problems can be solved by dynamic programming algorithms (Mu & Gu, 2010; Mu & Hao, 2010).

In this section, we review the problem of finding the set of Pareto optima when there are disjoint sets of jobs. As discussed in Section 4, some authors only provide an algorithm to determine the size of the non-dominated sets. For

Similar to the LCC approach, the single machine layout is the most extended case, all of them with global objective function. Taking into account that the problem is not symmetric, most of them have the form 1∥∊(f/f
                           
                              A

Extended problems have some condition/s for jobs and/or machines, indicated in the field β. In the next subsections, we review the main contributions for each approach. Note that, given the heterogeneity of the problems addressed, it is not possible to clearly classify the contributions as in the case of basic problems. Nevertheless, we have identified the following categories: Release times and/or preemption; Variable processing times (processing times are not fixed values); Batch and/or set-up; and Others. These categories should be interpreted in a loose manner and only as a way to classify the disparity of contributions.

Regarding problems in which release times are allowed,

Some references found in the literature consider MASPs with different objective functions and do not correspond to the previous subsections. Some of them are applied problems.


                           Agnetis et al. (2007a, chap. 2) consider a constraint specific of MASPs, where a coordination protocol is defined by an arbitrator. Each set of jobs belongs to an agent, who submits the jobs one by one to the arbitrator on each step. Between those jobs provided for each agent, the arbitrator selects one according to a priority rule, and schedules it at the end of the current schedule (initially empty). In this problem, the objective is to determine the order to provide the jobs for each agent to the arbitrator, since the priority rule is public information, whereas jobs characteristics are private information of the respective agent. Some rules encountered in the literature include priority rules (such as the well-known SPT, WSPT, EDD); Round-Robin rule (denoted as RR), where jobs are alternated from each set; or

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this work, we have reviewed a high number of papers containing different contributions to the field of multicriteria scheduling problems considering two or more sets of jobs. Up to 75 papers have been identified as related to the problem in the sense presented in this work, including only those papers written in English. Doing an analysis of the literature we concluded that the most suitable name for this kind of problems is interfering jobs scheduling problem. However, the most used term is multiagent scheduling problem (MASP). Problems have been classified in basic or extended problems, indicating the approach considered (Linear Convex Combination approach; ∊-constraint and Pareto approach). In the following, we will highlight the main conclusions and try to set some possible future research avenues.

The first comment refers to the fact that there are much more works solely devoted to extended problems (47) than to basic problems (20). Moreover, eight references consider both types of problems. This may be seen as an indicator that the research has been so far conducted by specific application areas rather than for a systematic approach, which is not surprising given the lack of an integrated framework that hopefully our paper may help to build. While there are clear advantages for the application-oriented approach (such as providing sound, real-life justification for research in the area) more research on the basic problems would set the foundations for gaining further advances on extended problems. Then, extensions of the solution procedures for the former can be implemented in the latter.

A second general comment is that most of the works refer to the one machine setting, which is clearly an indication of the fact that we are on the early stages of the research. Moreover, most of the single machine problems are NP-hard, so we can expect that a big number of problems are NP-hard. Therefore, in the next years, the number of contributions addressing other settings would increase. Interestingly, the proportion of works dealing with layouts different than the one-machine is higher for the extended problems than for the basic problems. Again, this point out the direction that most research has been application-driven.

Regarding basic problems, the case of disjoint sets of jobs has been the one receiving more attention. Some comments about the main results can be done:

                           In the one-machine layout, the LCC approach has been found to be polynomially solvable for many objectives, and only some specific cases of weighted objectives are shown not to be polynomial. Outside this layout, only the permutation flowshop with two machines has been studied for a very simple case (

                              ), which is already NP-hard.

The ∊-constraint approach has been found not to be polynomially solvable except for a very simple case, even for one machine and two objectives. However, relatively few approximate algorithms have been proposed for these problems. The cases with three or more objectives have been addressed only for specific rescheduling-related objective functions.

With respect to the Pareto approach, less work has been done, bounding the number of non-dominated solutions for most of the problems, mainly because the complexity of this approach.

Basic problem with non-disjoint sets of jobs have been addressed only for the case where one of the sets contains all jobs (called interfering jobs problems with global objective function). An interesting future research line could be to analyze the complexity for the more general case of non-disjoint (interfering) sets of jobs (i.e. when one of sets does not contain all jobs). The contributions with global objective function consider the ∊-constraint and LCC approaches, and they are due to two groups of authors, analyzing complexities for a great number of problems. There are hardly any algorithm proposed for these problems, so it is a open issue for this approach. In contrast, such algorithms have been proposed for the Pareto approach.

Regarding the extended problems, the case considering only one constraint has been scarcely studied, and a research avenue could be initiated in this area. Most of the works have been done for the case of disjoint sets of jobs under the LCC approach. In this type of problems, some general results have been presented regarding the learning effect. In contrast, those obtained for controllable processing times are very specific, focusing on the determination of the polynomially solvable cases. Regarding the Pareto approach, it is worth to note that many problems have been found not to be polynomially solvable, and several approximate algorithms (mostly based on metaheuristics) have been presented. Extended problems with non-disjoint sets of jobs have been scarcely studied, all of them for one machine.

Regarding solution procedures, there is an extensive contribution on studying the complexity, and a considerable number of one machine problems providing exact procedures have been found. It would be interesting to extend these results to other, more complex, machine layouts, even if it is likely that the complexity would increase. In contrast, there are relatively few approximate procedures available for the rest of the problems addressed with higher complexity (although it can be observed a concentration of similar methods for similar problems, for example some papers considering deteriorating and learning constraints). The relative scarcity of solution procedures is again another sign of a research field in its earliest stages, and it makes difficult to apply the research results. Another consequence of this fact is that there are only a handful of test beds to generate problem instances in which the solution procedures can be tested. Most of them consider the same size of the sets of jobs, avoiding extreme cases. Therefore, it may be interesting to generate a common and exhaustive test bed, considering different cases for the sizes of the jobs, in order to facilitate the comparison among solution procedures.

Finally, it is also worth mentioning that, in the case of more than two sets of jobs, most of the work is preliminary and for some specific cases, pointing at other future area of research.
