                  We introduce a new family of coalitional values designed to take into account players’ attitudes with regard to cooperation. This new family of values applies to cooperative games with a coalition structure by combining the Shapley value and the multinomial probabilistic values, thus generalizing the symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues. Besides an axiomatic characterization, a computational procedure is provided in terms of the multilinear extension of the game and an application to the Catalonia Parliament, Legislature 2003–2007, is shown.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Value theory started by Shapley (1953), who introduced the axiomatic method in cooperative game theory to define a solution concept called now the Shapley value. The Shapley value is characterized as the unique value to satisfy efficiency, the null player property, symmetry, and additivity.


                     Weber (1988) obtained a wide generalization of the Shapley value by defining the family of probabilistic values, each one of which requires weighting coefficients 
                        
                           p
                           S
                           i
                        
                      for each player i and each coalition S⊆N\{i}. The payoff that a probabilistic value allocates to each player is a weighted sum of his marginal contributions in the game. We quote from Weber (1988):

                        “Let player i view his participation in a game v as consisting merely of joining some coalition S and then receiving as a reward his marginal contribution to the coalition. If 
                              
                                 p
                                 S
                                 i
                              
                            is the probability that he joins coalition S, then ϕi
                           [v] is his expected payoff from the game.”
                     
                  


                     Puente (2000) (see also Freixas and Puente, 2002) defined two special subfamilies of probabilistic values: (a) binomial semivalues, where the weighting coefficients depend on a unique parameter q ∈ [0, 1]; and (b) multinomial probabilistic values, where the weighting coefficients depend on n parameters, one per player and all in [0, 1] too.

                        1
                        Incidentally, we point out that the “Banzhaf α-indices”, introduced by Carreras (2004) when generalizing the decisiveness notion studied in Carreras (2005), are multinomial probabilistic values applied to simple games—i.e., used as power indices. Cf. Carreras and Puente (2013) or Carreras and Puente (2014a) for a joint work on these values and Giménez, Llongueras, and Puente (2014) for their application to the study of the partnership formation, which generalizes Carreras, Llongueras, and Puente (2009) widely.
                      Of course, (a) is a subfamily of (b).

Introduced by Aumann and Drèze (1974), the notion of game with a coalition structure provided a new avenue for the development of value theory. Since then, a lot of work has been done in this new field, mainly addressed to define coalitional values that often represent extensions of classical values to this setup. The best known coalitional value is the Owen value, an extension of the Shapley value introduced by Owen (1977) 
                     (see also Owen, 2013). The Owen value is characterized uniquely by the following axioms: efficiency, the null player property, symmetry within unions, symmetry in the quotient game, and additivity.


                     Carreras and Puente (2006) (see also Carreras and Puente, 2011) extended the binomial semivalues to games with a coalition structure: they used these values in the quotient game and the Shapley value within unions and obtained the symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues, a family depending on one parameter q ∈ [0, 1] that includes (when q = 1/2) the symmetric coalitional Banzhaf value introduced by Alonso and Fiestras (2002). The only axiomatic difference between these new coalitional values and the Owen value is that the former satisfy the total power property whereas the latter satisfies efficiency.

In the present paper we extend the multinomial probabilistic values to games with a coalition structure by introducing the coalitional multinomial probabilistic values, a family that includes all symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues.

A first main aspect of the coalitional multinomial probabilistic values is that each one of them depends on n parameters (n being the number of players), which are interpreted as the individual tendencies of the players to form coalitions. A second main aspect is that they apply a multinomial probabilistic value in the quotient game that arises once the coalition structure is actually formed, but share within each union the payoff so obtained by applying the Shapley value to a game that concerns only the players of that union.

Using the Shapley value looks highly interesting in voting contexts. Indeed, once an alliance is formed—and, especially, if it supports a coalition government,—cabinet ministries, parliamentary and institutional positions, budget management, and other political responsibilities should be distributed among the members of the alliance efficiently, so the Shapley value is useful here. We thus evaluate not only the parliamentary power of the alliance but also the way to share this power allocation among its members. This two-step procedure (first power, then cake) offers a balanced approach for dealing with coalitional bargaining.

We emphasize the role of these new values as a consistent alternative to classical coalitional values. The fact that they are based on tendency profiles provides new tools to encompass a wide variety of situations that derive from players’ personalities when playing a game. In this sense, the coalitional multinomial probabilistic values constitute a significant generalization of the symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues, whose monoparametric condition implies a limited capability to analyze such situations. Of course, these situations cannot be analyzed, without modifying the game, by means of classical, nonparametric values, which can be concerned only with the (formal) structure of the game.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the greater ability of the new values to deal with strategic features is achieved without losing standard properties satisfied by classical coalitional values, e.g. linearity, positivity, the total power property, the dummy player property, symmetry within unions, or the quotient game property.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, a minimum of preliminaries is provided. Section 3 is devoted to define and to study the family of coalitional multinomial probabilistic values, including an axiomatic characterization. In Section 4 we restrict such values to simple games. Section 5 presents a computation procedure for these values by means of multilinear extensions. Section 6 contains an application of the coalitional multinomial probabilistic values to the analysis of the Catalonia Parliament (Legislature 2003–2007). Section 7 includes concluding remarks. All proofs are collected in Appendix A.

We assume that the reader is generally familiar with the basic ideas of the cooperative game theory (including simple games, which will be briefly revised in Section 4).

Let N be a finite set of players, usually denoted as N = {1, 2, …, n}, and 2
                           N
                         be the set of coalitions (subsets of N). A (cooperative) game in N is a function 
                           
                              v
                              :

                              R
                           
                         that assigns a real number v(S) to each coalition S⊆N, with v(∅) = 0. A game v is monotonic if v(S) ≤ v(T) whenever S⊂T⊆N. Player i ∈ N is a dummy in v if v(S∪{i}) = v(S) + v({i}) for all S⊆N\{i}, and null in v if, moreover, v({i}) = 0. Two players i, j ∈ N are symmetric in v if v(S∪{i}) = v(S∪{j}) for all S⊆N\{i, j}.

                         of all games in N becomes a vector space. For every nonempty coalition T⊆N, the unanimity gameuT
                         in N is defined by uT

                        (S) = 0 otherwise, and it is easily checked that the set of all unanimity games is a basis for

As was announced in Section 1, we will attach to each pi
                         the meaning of tendency of player i to form coalitions, and thus we will say that p is a (tendency) profile in N. The components of p will be assumed to be independent of each other. From Eq. (2) it follows that coefficient 
                           
                              
                                 p
                                 S
                                 i
                              
                              ,
                           
                         the probability of i to join S according to Weber (1988), is an increasing function of the tendency of each member of S to form coalitions and a decreasing function of the tendency in this sense of each outside player, i.e. each member of N\(S∪{i}).

Given N = {1, 2, …, n}, we will denote by B(N) the set of all partitions of N. Each B ∈ B(N) is called a coalition structure in N, and each member of B is called a union. The so-called trivial coalition structures are Bn
                         = {{1}, {2}, …, {n}} (individual coalitions) and BN
                         = {N} (grand coalition). A (cooperative) game with a coalition structure is a pair [v; B], where 
                           
                              v

                         and B ∈ B(N) for a given N. Each partition B gives a pattern of cooperation among players. We denote by

We will not try to discuss here which is the best option (if it exists). It may happen that different situations require different ways to define

Even more, nothing prevents different unions to make different choices when defining their respective tendencies in the quotient game—this is the reason for having imposed conditions (i) and (ii) for each union. Fortunately, the great freedom in this choice will not affect the validity of the theoretical results: the theory developed in this paper will be of application provided that

                         is a profile induced by p, no matter by which mechanism.

                           Although the results obtained in practice will depend in general of this mechanism (cf. Example 3.4).
                        
                     

However, in order to avoid using a more cumbersome notation and any ambiguity, we will implicitly assume from now on in the theoretical development that, for any given N, a unique mechanism has been chosen to induce, given p and B in N, a profile

To illustrate the two-step procedure, we consider a very simple instance: let n = 4 and game v be defined by v(S) = 1 if |S| ≥ 3 and v(S) = 0 otherwise. Let p = (0.4, 0.8, 0.6, 0.2) and B = {{1, 2}, {3}, {4}}. Let M = {1, 3, 4}, where 1 denotes the representative of {1, 2} and the remaining players represent themselves (a nonstandard but easier notation in particular cases like this). The quotient game is given by vB
                              (R) = 1 if R = {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 3, 4} and vB
                              (R) = 0 otherwise.

Then, in the case of singletons {3} and {4}, the payoff received by the union in the quotient game is allocated to its unique member. For union {1, 2}, the fact that its players are symmetric in v implies that they share the payoff equally. Thus (see Fig. 1
                              ),

What has happened with the symmetry of all players in the original game? Players 3 and 4 are symmetric also in the coalition structure, and hence in the quotient game, but their final payoffs differ because of their different parameters. Instead, players 1 and 2 earn a common final payoff, in spite of having different parameters, because they are in the same union.

The rest of this section is devoted to the discussion of common properties for all coalitional multinomial probabilistic values. Our main aim is to reach an axiomatic characterization for each one of these values. We begin by considering standard properties for a generic coalitional value g on

                              where

                               is the profile induced by p in M.

Our axiomatic characterization theorem essentially holds for any coalitional p-multibinary probabilistic value with a positive profile p = (p
                        1, p
                        2, …, pn
                        ).

                           This is revisited in the proof of Theorem 3.9.
                         “Positive” merely means that pi
                         > 0 for i = 1, 2, …, n. To ease the proof of this theorem it is convenient to state a preliminary result, which holds for any profile.

                           Proposition 3.8
                           Let p be a profile in N. The coalitional p-multinomial probabilistic value satisfies positivity and the quotient game property.

Let p be a positive profile in a given player set N. Then there is a unique coalitional value on 
                                 
                                    G
                                    N
                                    
                                       c
                                       s
                                    
                                 
                               that satisfies linearity, the dummy player property, symmetry within unions, the coalitional p-multinomial total power property, and the property of p-weighted payoffs for quotients of unanimity games. It is the coalitional p-multinomial probabilistic value.


                              Theorem 3.9, where linearity could be replaced with additivity, generalizes Theorem 1 in Alonso and Fiestras (2002) and Theorem 3.5 in Carreras and Puente (2006) (i.e., Theorem 3.6 in Carreras and Puente, 2011). We have checked the logical independence of the axiomatic system for Theorem 3.9 in Carreras and Puente (2014b).

We include here some comments on the properties of coalitional multinomial probabilistic values considered in the previous subsection.

                           Remark 3.11
                           The reader might be surprised because the possibility of having pi
                               ≠ pj
                               does not cause any trouble for symmetry within unions. However, this is not so striking since, as follows from Eq. (5), if i ∈ Bk
                               then

                                          p
                                       
                                    
                                    
                                       [
                                       v

                                       B

                               does not depend on 
                                 
                                    
                                       p

                               and hence on either pi
                               or pj
                               for any other j ∈ Bk
                              . This is a special feature of these coalitional values: the payoff that they allocate to a player i ∈ Bk
                               depends only on the position of this player in the original game and the coalition structure, and also on the tendencies of the other unions which, in turn, depend only on the tendencies of their respective members according to 3.1(i).

With our notation Eq. (6) becomes, for the coalitional p-multinomial probabilistic value,

                              -multinomial total power property is the natural extension of a total power property that was first stated for the Banzhaf value Owen (1975) (cf. also Dragan, 1996; Dubey and Shapley, 1979) and gave rise later, among others, to the coalitional q-binomial total power property (Alonso et al., 2007; Carreras and Puente, 2006; 2011) and the p-multinomial total power property (Carreras and Puente, 2013; 2014a). It reduces to this latter if B = Bn
                               but it also extends efficiency, to which it reduces if B = BN

                              However, it is easy to see (even for n = 2) that this is not true in general. A simple argument shows that a coalitional multinomial probabilistic value satisfies symmetry in the quotient game iff it reduces to a symmetric coalitional binomial semivalue, so that symmetry in the quotient game characterizes the family of symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues within the class of coalitional multinomial probabilistic values.

It should be clear that the failure is essentially due to the fact that, in general, neither 
                                 
                                    λ

                               satisfy anonymity. But this is precisely the positive reason by which we are considering here multinomial probabilistic values instead of binomial semivalues: the possibility, offered by profiles p and

The property of p
                              -weighted payoffs for quotients of unanimity games does not hold for general quotients. The corresponding statement, that could be called “p-weighted symmetry in the quotient game” would look as follows: if k, ℓ ∈ M are symmetric players in vB

Simple games constitute an especially interesting class of cooperative games. Not only as a test bed for many cooperative concepts, but also for the variety of their interpretations, often far from game theory. In particular, they have been intensively applied to describe and analyze collective decision-making mechanisms and the notion of voting power in the sense of, e.g., Shapley and Shubik (1954) and Banzhaf (1965).

A cooperative game v in N is simple iff it is monotonic, v(S) ∈ {0, 1} for every S⊆N, and v(N) = 1. A coalition S⊆N is winning in v if v(S) = 1 (otherwise it is called losing), and W(v) denotes the set of winning coalitions in v. Due to monotonicity, the subset Wm
                     (v) of all minimal winning coalitions determines W(v) and hence the game. A simple game v is a weighted majority game iff there are nonnegative weightsw

                     2, …, wn

                        In some manner, for simple games the transfer property replaces linearity. We have also checked the logical independence of the axiomatic system for Theorem 4.1 in Carreras and Puente (2014b).

                        Let p be a positive profile in a given player set N. Then there is a unique coalitional power index on

It is (the restriction of) the coalitional p-multinomial probabilistic value. Moreover, this coalitional power index satisfies positivity and the quotient game property.

In this section we present a method to compute any coalitional multinomial probabilistic value by means of the multilinear extension of the game. For the sake of completeness, we recall from Puente (2000), Freixas and Puente (2002) that, if f(x
                     1, x
                     2, …, xn
                     ) is the multilinear extension of game v in N and p = (p

We consider here the Catalonia Parliament in Legislature 2003–2007, prematurely finished.
                        9
                     
                     
                        9
                        Deep disagreements among the parties participating in the coalition government led in 2006 to the dissolution of the Catalonia Parliament and early elections. However, our analysis remains valid for Legislature 2006–2010: in spite of the different seat distribution given by the elections held on November 1, 2006, the strategic possibilities were exactly the same.
                     
                  

The Catalan political life is rich and fairly complicated. There are two basic ideological axes to locate parties: the classical left-to-right axis and a crossed axis going from Spanish centralism to Catalanism (see Fig. 2
                     ). Restrictions to the cooperation between parties arise from ideological affinities or incompatibilities, strategic behavior, and even from links with parties of national level and the influence of the national politics developed in Madrid.

Five parties elected members to the Catalonia Parliament (135 seats) in the elections held on November 16, 2003. A brief ideological description of the parties and the seat distribution are as follows.

                        
                           1:
                           CiU (Convergència i Unió), Catalan nationalist middle-of-the-road coalition of two federated parties, CDC and UDC: 46 seats.

PSC (Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya), moderate left-wing socialist party, federated to the Partido Socialista Obrero Español: 42 seats.

ERC (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya), radical Catalan nationalist left-wing party: 23 seats.

PPC (Partit Popular de Catalunya), conservative party, Catalan delegation of the Partido Popular: 15 seats.

ICV (Iniciativa per Catalunya–Verds), coalition of Catalan eurocommunist parties, federated to Izquierda Unida, and ecologist groups (“Verds”): 9 seats.

Under the standard absolute majority rule, and assuming voting discipline within parties, the structure of this parliamentary body can be represented by the weighted majority game

Thus, in the fall of 2003, a main feature of the Catalonia Parliament issued from the elections was the absence of a party enjoying absolute majority, so a coalition government was expected to form. We will not try to give here a full description of the complexity of the Catalan politics, a task more suitable for a political science article. We wish only to state that the politically most likely coalitions to form, and the corresponding coalition structures to the analysis of which we will limit ourselves, were clearly the following:

                        
                           •
                           CiU + ERC, the Catalanist majority alliance: BC
                               = {{1, 3}, {2}, {4}, {5}}.

PSC + ERC + ICV, the left-wing majority alliance: BL
                               = {{1}, {2, 3, 5}, {4}}, which was finally formed.

We would like to analyze this situation. Of course, our main interest will center on the strategic possibilities of party 3 (ERC), whose position is crucial in the two-alternative scenario we are considering.

A classical approach to study the problem would consist in using either (a) the Shapley value and the Owen value, (b) the Banzhaf value and the Owen–Banzhaf modified value, or (c) the Banzhaf value and the symmetric coalitional Banzhaf value, in order to evaluate the strategic possibilities of each party under both hypotheses (Catalanist coalition vs. left-wing coalition).

                     , where (–) means no coalition formation, (C) means that CiU + ERC forms, and (LW) means that PSC + ERC + ICV forms.

According to (a), ERC would strictly prefer joining CiU instead of PSC and ICV. The same conclusion is obtained according to (b). Instead, according to (c), ERC would strictly prefer joining PSC and ICV instead of CiU.

Using in case (c) binomial semivalues—and symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues whenever a coalition structure exists—the conclusion of the analysis is that ERC was not necessarily forced to participate in the left-wing tripartite government but would have gained more political power in joining CiU depending on the (common) tendency parameter q of the parties to form coalitions. More precisely, ERC should have chosen PSC and ICV if, and only if, q was in the interval

                      and hence ERC should have preferred CiU for 44.72 percent of possibilities. The details can be found in Carreras and Puente (2011).

Now we will apply multinomial probabilistic values. All allocations needed here have been computed using the multilinear extension technique, most of them in Example 5.2.

First, it is difficult in principle to say anything of importance about the expressions for λ
                     
                        p
                     [v] found in Example 5.2. Fortunately, a simplification can be reasonably achieved. Indeed, the almost isolated political position of party 4 (PPC) with regard to the remaining parties strongly suggests taking p
                     4 ≈ 0, which will make things easier. In particular, this assumption will reduce the set of politically feasible minimal winning coalitions to

These allocations reflect the a priori power distribution. (a) The payoff to party 1 positively depends on the interest of parties 2 and 3 to form coalitions (e.g. {1, 2} or {1, 3}), but not completely because it is partially damaged if party 5 is interested in entering a coalition ({2, 3, 5}). (b) The payoff to party 2 is improved by either the interest of party 1 combined with the apathy of parties 3 and 5 (that would favor {1, 2}) or, conversely, by the interest of these parties combined with the unconcern of party 1, which would give more chances to {2, 3, 5} instead of {1, 2} and {1, 3}. (c) The same is true, mutatis mutandis, for party 3. (d) Finally, the possibilities of party 5 clearly rest upon the interest of parties 2 and 3 and the inertia of party 1.

Summing up, the evaluation of the game in terms of multinomial probabilistic values reflects the a priori tensions existing within each feasible (minimal winning) coalition, in terms of parameters concerning the will of each party in the coalition formation process. Tendency profiles allow us therefore to overcome the formal structure of the game and try to understand why a specific coalition forms.

Now we use the coalitional multinomial probabilistic value Λ
                     
                        p
                     . We assume in the sequel p
                     4 ≈ 0 and divide the study into two stages.

We apply Λ
                              
                                 p

                               for any profile p. Then

It is not true that all players get profit, with respect to the a priori power distribution, from entering a coalition. There always exist suitable values of the pi
                              ’s that produce a damage to a given player when joining.

Incidentally, let us notice that profile

                               does not appear in these expressions for several reasons: (a) the payoffs to the members of a union depend only on the tendencies of the remaining unions; (b) if a union Br
                               reduces to a singleton {j} then

                              ; (c) in both BC
                               and BL
                              , only one coalition with more than one member forms, so that the payoffs to its players can be expressed, according to (b), only in terms of profile p for any induced profile

                              ; (d) since the coalition that forms is winning, the quotient game is a dictatorship, and hence the outside players become null and get 0. In both scenarios, the payoffs sum up to 1 by local efficiency.

Finally, we will discuss the strategic possibilities of party 3 (ERC). The power of party 3 in BC

                              5 as a function of p

                              1 and tends to 1 (its maximum) in the degenerate case. Of course, p
                              1 = 0 gives the best payoff to party 3.

Hence there are “many” cases where party 3 should prefer party 1 instead of parties 2 and 5. In other words, party 1 could adapt its tendency (availability to form coalitions) to those of parties 2 and 5.

The conclusion of this analysis is that joining CiU would have not been a bad decision for ERC. But also that CiU should have been very careful in expressing its interest to form coalitions, a point where maybe its leaders were not strategically efficient enough. A scenario where the main party becomes excluded of the government must be considered exceptional.

We have introduced here coalitional multinomial probabilistic values. They apply to games with a coalition structure by combining the Shapley value and the corresponding multinomial probabilistic value. We first apply this latter value to the quotient game and obtain a payoff for each union; next, we apply within each union the Shapley value to a reduced game, played in the union, for sharing that payoff efficiently. These values form a n-parametric family since they depend on profiles p = (p
                     1, p
                     2, …, pn
                     ) that supply information not necessarily included in the characteristic function of the game. We interpret each component pi
                      as the tendency of player i to form coalitions.

By using coalitional multinomial probabilistic values one can take into account the influence of players’ different personalities in the study of the coalition formation process. The detailed analysis of the Catalonia Parliament in Section 6 illustrates this idea and also the good behavior of these values as power indices (i.e., acting on simple games).

In our opinion, by no means these values can qualify as “rare earths”.

                      In effect: (a) they lie in the well recognized class of probabilistic values (Weber, 1988); (b) they generalize the symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues (Carreras and Puente, 2006) widely (and, in particular, the symmetric coalitional Banzhaf value (Alonso and Fiestras, 2002)); and (c) they do not admit technical objections, enjoy good properties, and provide a promising framework for applications. Moreover, the model presented here is open to modifications.

Thus, future work should focus on several aspects concerning the use and interpretation of the tendency profiles and hence of the values. Below is a list of possibilities to act, some of which agree with suggestions made by the reviewers.

                              ’s.

To discuss who defines the tendencies, in both the game and the quotient game, and whether they can be assumed common knowledge.

To discover new properties of the values. This task has been already initiated by members of our research group for multinomial probabilistic values and good results have been obtained that will be published soon. Some of these properties will probably extend to the coalitional case.

To reach new individual axiomatic characterizations for each value.

To establish an axiomatic characterization of the full family of coalitional multinomial probabilistic values (so independent of profiles p that define each member). A similar characterization has been already reached for multinomial probabilistic values (Carreras and Puente, 2014a).

To extend the coalitional version to all probabilistic values introduced by Weber (1988).

                              and therefore we need only to prove that g is uniquely determined on each unanimity game uT
                              . The remaining of the proof is exactly the same as in the case of Theorem 3.9.

Steps 1–3 have been already used in Owen and Winter (1992), Carreras and Magaña (1994), Puente (2000), Freixas and Puente (2002), Alonso, Carreras, and Fiestras (2005), Carreras and Puente (2006); 2011). It will be of interest to recall the common argument here.

By the second and third steps, we obtain a multilinear function where all terms of (1) corresponding to coalitions S such that S∩Br
                               ≠ ∅ and (N\S)∩Br
                               ≠ ∅ for some r ∈ M\{k} vanish. Indeed, in step 2, the terms corresponding to these coalitions are of the form

                              ) thus getting zero.

Hence, the only coalitions S for which the corresponding term of the multilinear extension in Eq. (1) may not vanish after steps 2 and 3 are those of the form S = Q∪T, where T⊆Bk
                               and
