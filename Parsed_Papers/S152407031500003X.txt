                  Given a set of symmetric/antisymmetric filter vectors containing only regular multiresolution filters, the method we present in this article can establish a balanced multiresolution scheme for images, allowing their balanced decomposition and subsequent perfect reconstruction without the use of any extraordinary boundary filters. We define balanced multiresolution such that it allows balanced decomposition i.e. decomposition of a high-resolution image into a low-resolution image and corresponding details of equal size. Such a balanced decomposition makes on-demand reconstruction of regions of interest efficient in both computational load and implementation aspects. We find this balanced decomposition and perfect reconstruction based on an appropriate combination of symmetric/antisymmetric extensions near the image and detail boundaries. In our method, exploiting such extensions correlates to performing sample (pixel/voxel) split operations. Our general approach is demonstrated for some commonly used symmetric/antisymmetric multiresolution filters. We also show the application of such a balanced multiresolution scheme in real-time focus+context visualization.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Applications that facilitate multiscale 2D and 3D image visualization and exploration (see [17,34,28], for example) benefit from multiresolution schemes that decompose high-resolution images into low-resolution approximations and corresponding details (usually, wavelet coefficients). Several subsequent applications of such a decomposition constructs the corresponding wavelet transform. This wavelet transform can then be used to derive low-resolution approximations of the entire image, as well as high-resolution approximations of a region of interest (ROI), on demand. Reconstructing the high-resolution approximation of a ROI involves locating the corresponding details from a hierarchy of details within the wavelet transform. One such hierarchy of details resulting from only two levels of decomposition of an Earth image (data source: Visible Earth, NASA) is shown in Fig. 1
                        .

For the purpose of demonstration, we created the wavelet transform in Fig. 1 using the short filters of quadratic B-spline presented by Samavati et al. [27,28]. In practice, images that require multiscale visualization are larger in size and may require more levels of decomposition. For each level of decomposition in this particular example, the image was first decomposed heightwise and then widthwise.

Sequences of samples along each image dimension can be treated as finite-length signals. It is well-known that decomposition and reconstruction of finite-length signals require special treatments at the boundaries [1], which often involves the use of extraordinary boundary filters. The use of extraordinary boundary filters (as opposed to regular filters) for handling image and detail boundaries lead to computationally untidy reconstruction near image boundaries.

From a hierarchy of details, such as the one in Fig. 1, if we need to reconstruct the high-resolution approximation of a ROI located in the low-resolution (coarse) image shown in the top-left rectangle in Fig. 1, we have to locate the corresponding details in some or all of the rectangles that contain details depending on the expected level of resolution. Locating these details will be straightforward if each of the heightwise and widthwise decomposition steps decomposes an image into two halves of equal size – one half corresponding to the coarse image and the other half corresponding to the details. Among B-spline wavelets, only the filters obtained from Haar wavelets provide such a balanced decomposition [12,29]. However, because Haar wavelets and the associated scaling functions are not continuous, it would be beneficial to achieve such a balanced decomposition for the filters obtained from higher order scaling functions and their wavelets.

Existing multiresolution schemes for the local filters of second or higher order scaling functions and their wavelets (see [28,5,8,21], for example) result in unequal numbers of coarse and detail samples after decomposition (i.e.

                         in Fig. 1). Such inequalities resulting from decomposition make locating the details corresponding to a ROI for reconstruction a cumbersome task (which involves keeping track of level-wise offsets from boundaries), specially when an interactive multilevel visualization hierarchy (see Fig. 13(a), for example) is concerned. Creation of a such an interactive visualization hierarchy requires efficient on-demand access to details.

In contrast, balanced decompositions can construct balanced wavelet transforms, such as the one shown in Fig. 2
                         (data source: Visible Earth, NASA). In Fig. 2, the rectangles containing different levels of details for the entire image are numbered with 
                           
                              (
                              l
                              ,
                              1
                              )
                           
                         tuples for widthwise and 
                           
                              (
                              l
                              ,
                              2
                              )
                           
                         tuples for heightwise decompositions, where l represents the level of resolution. Locating the details corresponding to a ROI on demand in a balanced wavelet transform includes a number of simple dyadic operations, which are known to perform significantly faster than non-dyadic operations in both hardware and software implementations. Such efficient access to details is demonstrated by means of an example in Fig. 2. In general, if

In order to address the issues discussed above, in this article, we introduce a technique for devising balanced multiresolution schemes for the local filters of second or higher order scaling functions and their wavelets. Our technique uses an appropriate combination of symmetric/antisymmetric extensions near the image and detail boundaries, which correlate to sample split operations. To guarantee a perfect (lossless) reconstruction without the use of any extraordinary boundary filters, our method requires each of the given decomposition and reconstruction filter vectors (kernels) to be either symmetric or antisymmetric about their centers. Many existing sets of local regular multiresolution filters, such as those associated with the B-spline wavelets [28], biorthogonal and reverse biorthogonal wavelets [5,8], and Meyer wavelets [21,8], exhibit such symmetric/antisymmetric structures.

We present a novel method to devise a balanced multiresolution scheme for a given set of symmetric/antisymmetric multiresolution filter vectors containing regular filters. Devised balanced multiresolution schemes allow balanced decomposition and perfect reconstruction without the use of extraordinary boundary filters. A balanced wavelet transform representation of an image resulting from balanced decompositions provides straightforward and efficient access to previously extracted details corresponding to a ROI on demand. We also provide ready-to-use balanced multiresolution schemes devised using our proposed method for eleven commonly used sets of symmetric/antisymmetric multiresolution filter vectors (see Table A.2). Additionally, we show the application of a devised balanced multiresolution scheme in real-time multilevel focus+context visualization of large-scale 2D and 3D images. As opposed to in-place magnification of ROIs, the presented mode of focus+context visualization uses contextual close-ups to display spatially separate magnification of ROIs constructed through perfect reconstructions.

This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the notations used throughout the article. Next, we formulate the problem definition in Section 3, which is followed by a brief survey of the existing related work in Section 4. Section 5 presents our method for devising a balanced multiresolution scheme accompanied by two examples – one for odd-length and the other for even-length decomposition filter vectors. We demonstrate the application of a balanced multiresolution scheme devised by our method in real-time focus+context visualization with experimental results in Section 6. In Section 7, we discuss with examples what may lead to unwanted extraordinary boundary reconstruction filters and highlight some characteristics of our method with possible directions for future work. Finally, Section 8 concludes the article. We also provide two appendices with additional examples of balanced multiresolution schemes devised by our method.

In this article, we adopted the notations for representing multiresolution operations used by Samavati et al. in [28]. The superscripts k and l used in this section represent the levels of resolution. Multiresolution operations are specified in terms of analysis filter matrices

                        . Whole-sample antisymmetry, not shown in Fig. 3, can be obtained by negating the samples in the extensions of Fig. 3(b). Note that the types of extensions at both ends of a sequence do not necessarily have to be the same (as used in Fig. 12, for example).

To be consistent with the coloring used in Fig. 3, from this point forward in this article, notations and figures may use red, purple, and green to denote the samples introduced by half-sample symmetric, whole-sample symmetric, and half-sample antisymmetric extensions, respectively.

In the next three subsections, we review the existing related work within the following three categories: multiresolution, symmetric and antisymmetric extensions, and focus+context visualization.

Here we review the multiresolution methods applicable to curves and tensor-product meshes (surfaces and volumes) given their applicability to multidimensional images due to their regular structure.

Hierarchical representation of multiresolution tensor-product surfaces was made possible due to the pioneering work of Forsey and Bartels [10]. They localized the editing effect in a desired manner on tensor-product surfaces through hierarchically controlled subdivisions. This was done by adding finer sets of B-splines onto existing coarse sets. However, it resulted in an over-representation because the union of the sets of basis functions from different resolutions did not form a set of basis functions. Adding complementary basis functions to the coarse set of basis functions is a possible way to resolve the problem of over-representation. This means of supporting multiresolution is closely aligned to the wavelet theory approach to multiresolution [29]. Wavelet representations of details may, however, introduce undesired undulations, as pointed out by Gortler and Cohen [11]. Furthermore, under this approach, optimizing the behavior of the analysis (decomposition) using least squares is difficult due to the need to support interactive mesh manipulations [36].

Samavati and Bartels pioneered in their work on a mathematically clean and efficient approach to multiresolution based on reverse subdivision [26,3,2,4]. Under this approach, during the analysis, each coarse vertex is obtained by efficiently solving a local least squares optimization problem. The use of least squares optimization reduces the undesired undulations. Additionally, the resulting wavelets provide a much more compact support compared to the conventional wavelets for curves and regular surfaces. Some of the examples demonstrating the application of our proposed method use multiresolution filters resulting from this approach (see the examples in Section 5, for instance).

Notable existing approaches obtaining a multiresolution representation supporting context-aware visualization of 3D images include the wavelet tree [34], segmentation of texture-space into an octree [17,24,23], octree-based tensor approximation hierarchy [30], and trilinear resampling on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) coupled with the deformation of regularly partitioned image regions [35]. For 4D images, the wavelet-based time–space partitioning (WTSP) tree was used in [34]. In [34], Haar [12,29] and Daubechies’s D4 [7] wavelets were used to construct the wavelet transforms in each node of the wavelet and WTSP trees.

As mentioned earlier, we achieve balanced decomposition and subsequent perfect reconstruction based on the use of an appropriate combination of symmetric and antisymmetric extensions near the image and detail boundaries. In the literature, symmetric and antisymmetric extensions were used in the context of various types of wavelet transforms [18,16,1,19]. In contrast, our proposed method allows the construction of a balanced wavelet transform.

For end point and boundary interpolations, extraordinary filters (as opposed to regular filters) are used in multiresolution methods for curves and regular meshes, respectively. However, the use of extraordinary filters at image boundaries for boundary interpolation assigns incongruous importance to the image boundaries. So for 2D or 3D image decomposition, the general practice is to use symmetric extensions near the image boundaries to avoid boundary case evaluations using extraordinary filters [28]. However, an arbitrary choice of symmetric extension for decomposition while using a given set of multiresolution filters may eventually lead to the use of extraordinary boundary filters for a perfect reconstruction (see Section 7, for example). This can also make on-demand reconstruction of image parts corresponding to a ROI computationally untidy near the image boundaries. Therefore, a careful setup of symmetric/antisymmetric extensions for both decomposition and reconstruction is required, which can be obtained by our presented method.

Because we chose to demonstrate the use of a balanced multiresolution scheme resulting from our method in a real-time focus+context visualization application, here we review some of the notable related work.

In many visualization tasks, it is useful to simultaneously visualize both the local and global views of the data, possibly at different scales, which is known as focus+context visualization. One approach to implement focus+context is to use the metaphor of lenses [33,35,13]. This metaphor is inspired by techniques used in traditional medical (see Fig. 4
                        ), technical, and scientific illustrations [14].

Our implemented approach to focus+context visualization of multidimensional images is closest to the technique presented by Taerum et al. for the visualization of small-scale clinical volumetric datasets [33]. In their approach, the resolution of a given 3D image is reduced by one level using reverse subdivision [26,3], which is rendered during user interactions to achieve interactive frame rates. The 3D image is rendered in the original resolution while there is no user-interaction. The ROI identified by a query window is enlarged by the application of B-spline subdivision to allow different levels of smoothness. Therefore, the authors used only three different levels of resolution. In contrast, our implementation for multiresolution visualization of images provides a true multiresolution framework, where the resolutions of both the coarse image (providing context information) and the enlarged ROI (providing focus information) can be controlled by the user.

In this section, we explain and demonstrate by examples how our method achieves balanced decomposition and subsequent perfect reconstruction by choosing an appropriate combination of symmetric and antisymmetric extensions near the image and detail boundaries.

We defined balanced decomposition as the task of decomposing a high-resolution image into a low-resolution image and corresponding details of equal size. Balanced decomposition of a 3D image of dimensions

                                              as a linear combination of some samples from C and D.

Rewrite the linear combination(s) of coarse and detail samples on the right-hand side(s) of the equation(s) obtained in step 2(b) using the regular filter values from the filter vectors

                                              as coefficients. Such rewriting of fine samples here correlates to performing sample split operations. This will reveal the following two pieces of information applicable to the left boundaries of C and D for a perfect reconstruction: (i) the type of symmetric/antisymmetric extension that must be used and (ii) the number of extra samples that must be to introduced.(For example, see Eq. (10) and the equations in (21).)

Use an approach similar to that in step 2 to reconstruct the samples in

                            respectively from C and D, such that condition (iv) of the problem definition given in Section 3 is satisfied.

Now, if we substitute the actual values of the corresponding regular filters of quadratic B-spline from Eq. (4) in Eqs. (15) and (16), we find that Eq. (15) only satisfies the sufficient conditions under case I (i.e.

(15) was obtained by the use of half-sample symmetric extension on the left boundary of F for a balanced decomposition. This implies that the use of half-sample symmetric extension at the left boundary of F for a balanced decomposition will ensure the perfect reconstruction of that boundary only using regular reconstruction filters. Similarly, for the regular filters of quadratic B-spline from Eq. (4), we can show that

The example in this section illustrates the use of decomposition filter vectors of odd width for a balanced decomposition as opposed to the even width of decomposition filter vectors in the previous example (subSections 5.1 and 5.2). Further examples are provided in Appendix A.

                           The filter vectors in Eq. (18) are known as the inverse powers of two filters of cubic (fourth order) B-spline [28]. We explain the balanced decomposition process using the decomposition filter vectors in Eq. (18) through the example shown in Fig. 10
                           . Similar to the previous example shown in Fig. 5, here we have a column vector of 8 fine samples

                           Fig. 10 shows one possible balanced decomposition using our general approach presented in Section 5.1. Step 1 of our general construction given in Section 5.1 reveals that 5 extra samples are required to ensure a balanced decomposition.

                            for the filter vectors in Eq. (18) are odd. So according to step 2, whole-sample symmetric extension is used to introduce 2 extra samples at one end and 3 extra samples at the other end of F to obtain the extended column vector of fine samples

Multiscale 2D and 3D image visualization applications often exploit query window-based focus+context visualization for image exploration and navigation purposes. A low-resolution approximation is rendered to provide the context and a selected portion of that low-resolution approximation defining the focus, also known as the ROI, is rendered as a close-up in high-resolution. While such visualization is supported by an underlying wavelet transform, it is necessary to reconstruct the high-resolution approximation of the ROI on demand from the low-resolution approximation and corresponding details. Here the use of a balanced wavelet transform constructed by our proposed method makes locating the details straightforward. For instance, observe the reconstruction of interior samples in Figs. 6 and 11. If the first coarse sample for the reconstruction of a fine sample is 
                        
                           
                              
                                 c
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                     , then first detail sample to use in the reconstruction of that fine sample is 
                        
                           
                              
                                 d
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                     . This may not have been the case if we had an unequal number of coarse and detail samples from decomposition. Also, the only additional step required to reconstruct the fine samples near the boundaries is the use of specific symmetric/antisymmetric extensions, because our method completely eliminates the need for extraordinary boundary filters.

We have implemented a visualization tool prototype named Focus+Context Studio to test our presented balanced multiresolution framework for images. It robustly allows real-time multilevel focus+context visualization of large-scale 2D and 3D images, supported by multiple movable query windows defining ROIs at different resolutions. It currently uses the balanced multiresolution scheme we devised using the short filters of quadratic B-spline in Eq. (4), as described in the examples shown in subSections 5.1 and 5.2. Therefore, it uses half-sample symmetric extensions for the sequences of fine samples during decomposition in the fashion shown in Fig. 5. On the other hand, for a perfect reconstruction, it uses half-sample symmetric extensions for the sequences of coarse samples and half-sample antisymmetric extensions for the sequences of detail samples in the manner shown in Fig. 7. The used balanced multiresolution scheme in its general form can be found in the second row of Table A.2. At the moment, all the query windows are 
                           
                              32
                              ×
                              32
                           
                         samples in dimension.

To facilitate focus+context visualization and exploration of a 3D image, our prototype currently allows the query windows identifying the ROIs to move back and forth through sequential slices interactively by the use of mouse scroll wheel and alternatively, the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard. When the query windows move from one slice to another, the low-resolution approximation of the context and the high-resolution approximations of the ROIs are updated on the fly in real-time. For 3D images, currently it only performs widthwise and heightwise decompositions, which keeps the number of 2D slices intact for depthwise volume exploration.

                        Fig. 13 shows various scenarios for focus+context visualization of 2D images using our prototype. Figs. 13(a) and (b) show multilevel focus+context visualization of large-scale 2D images showing the topographic and bathymetric shading of northwestern North America (data source: D. Sandwell et al., University of California San Diago, USA) and the topographic shading of Long Island (data source: G. Hanson, Stony Brook University, USA), respectively. Similar multilevel focus+context visualization is shown for a diseased leaf (data source: S. Fraser-Smith, Wikipedia) in Fig. 13(c). Such multilevel focus+context visualization is motivated by the need for more manageable utilization of screen space and visualization of the context at a higher resolution while maintaining interactive frame rates.

Next, for a 2D image, Figs. 13(d) and (e) show different levels of decomposition for the context and different levels of reconstruction for the high-resolution approximation of the ROI using our developed tool. The 2D image used in this example is an abdomen slice from a male (data source: Male Abdomen, The Visible Human Project, U.S. National Library of Medicine). One advantage of allowing multiple query windows corresponding to multiple ROIs is the ability to draw comparisons between similar ROIs when required. Fig. 13(f) shows such a comparison scenario between the tropical storm Parma on the left and typhoon Melor on the right (data source: MODIS Rapid Response Team, NASA). Another such scenario comparing the ice near the coasts of Greenland and Alexander Island (data source: Visible Earth, NASA) is shown in Fig. 13(g).

Our developed prototype is also suitable for the visualization and exploration of time-lapse imagery. For instance, Fig. 14 shows 12 unique frames from the interactive transition through the 12 slices of monthly global images (data source: R. Stöckli, Monthly Global Images, NASA). The order of frames is shown by directions marked on the curved-arrow in the middle. The ROI covers most of northwestern North America and shows the transition from one winter to the following winter.


                        Fig. 15 shows an example of visualization and exploration of a 3D image in our prototype. For the purpose of demonstration, the transition through 10 of the 150 slices that the query windows were constrained to move back and forth through are shown in Fig. 15 (data source: Female head, The Visible Human Project, U.S. National Library of Medicine). This head dataset contains a total of 1477 2D slices, each of dimensions 
                           
                              1056

                        , among which 150 sequential slices were loaded into our prototype for this example.

Not using the type of symmetric extension suggested by our general construction in Section 5.1 to obtain the extra fine samples required for a balanced decomposition may lead to the use of extraordinary boundary filters. For the sake of comparison, we used half-sample symmetric extension in place of the suggested whole-sample symmetric extension to obtain the five extra fine samples required for a balanced decomposition using the decomposition filter vectors in Eq. (A.3), which contains the wide and optimal filters of cubic B-spline. This led to the following matrix equation for a perfect reconstruction, both

                     in place of Eq. (A.4). Note that such extraordinary boundary filters in

                      matrices do not allow the anticipated sample split operations that yield suitable symmetric/antisymmetric extensions to use for C and D for a perfect reconstruction only by the use of regular filters.

Our method can be used to devise a balanced multiresolution scheme for any set of given regular multiresolution filter vectors. However, if the scheme would only make use of regular reconstruction filters is determined by the properties of the given multiresolution filter vectors. If the given filter vectors are symmetric/antisymmetric, then our method can devise a balanced multiresolution scheme that only uses regular filters. Otherwise, some extraordinary boundary reconstruction filters are introduced (see B, for instance).

The balanced multiresolution schemes devised by our approach can also be applied to open curves and tensor product meshes (surfaces and volumes) in applications where boundary interpolation is not important but a balanced decomposition is preferred, for reasons such as partitioning the curve or the mesh into even and odd vertices. Such a partitioning allows the storage of coarse vertices and details in even and odd vertices, respectively, as proposed in [22]. However, some of the devised balanced multiresolution schemes may support boundary interpolation only in the context of subdivision i.e. when we only consider the result of 
                        
                           P
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                      in order to increase the resolution of C. For example, the filters of second order B-spline in Eq. (A.1) and the short filters of third order B-spline in Eq. (4) lead to such boundary interpolating subdivisions.

There is a number of directions for future research. In this article, we covered the commonly used types of symmetric and antisymmetric extensions. It would be useful to investigate and develop extension types that can be utilized to devise balanced multiresolution schemes for near symmetric and asymmetric filter vectors in order to ensure a perfect reconstruction solely by the use of regular filters. To start with, the devised balanced multiresolution scheme given in B for Daubechies’ asymmetric D4 filters may provide some insights.

In addition, further investigations are needed for an in-depth understanding of the relations between the symmetry/antisymmetry exhibited by the filter vectors, parity of their widths, and the determined types of symmetric/antisymmetric extensions required for a perfect reconstruction using only regular filters. For instance, compare the multiresolution filter vectors containing the inverse powers of two filters of fourth order B-spline in Eq. (18) and the wide and optimal filters of fourth order B-spline in Eq. (A.3). In these two sets, the corresponding filter vectors have the same widths and they are all symmetric. Now, observe that the two balanced multiresolution schemes we devised using these two sets of filter vectors suggest exactly the same type of symmetric extensions for the column vectors of fine, coarse, and detail samples. Therefore, the determined types of symmetric/antisymmetric extensions are not dependant on actual filter values. Several other such scenarios are shown in Table A.2.

From application’s standpoint, our current implementation supporting focus+context visualization of 3D images (see Fig. 15, for example) can be extended by additionally performing depthwise balanced decompositions and allowing 3D ROIs that are not necessarily axis-aligned. These will facilitate a more flexible visualization framework for large-scale 3D images.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this article, we presented a novel method for devising a balanced multiresolution scheme, primarily applicable to images, using a given set of symmetric/antisymmetric filter vectors containing regular multiresolution filters. A balanced multiresolution scheme resulting from our method allows balanced decomposition and subsequent perfect reconstruction of images without using any extraordinary boundary filters. This is achieved by the use of an appropriate combination of symmetric and antisymmetric extensions at the image and detail boundaries, correlating to implicit sample split operations. Balanced wavelet transform of an image constructed through balanced decompositions provides straightforward and efficient access to details corresponding to a ROI on demand.

In order to support smooth multiresolution representations of images beyond Haar wavelets and the associated scaling functions, and still exploit the advantages of a balanced decomposition, we used our method to devise balanced multiresolution schemes for some commonly used sets of local multiresolution filters obtained from higher order scaling functions and their wavelets. Any such balanced multiresolution scheme can be used to generate a balanced wavelet transform representation of a multidimensional image in a preprocessing phase, which can then be utilized to support its focus+context visualization in an efficient manner.

We also presented a set of experimental results produced using our developed Focus+Context Studio prototype that allows interactive multilevel focus+context visualization of large-scale 2D and 3D images. It exploits the balanced multiresolution scheme we devised from the short filters of quadratic B-spline in Eq. (4). We envision the integration of the key functionalities of our prototype in visualization systems and application programming interfaces (APIs) to enable users to visualize and explore the contents of complex imagery such as large-scale satellite images, clinical data, seismic data, etc.

Although providing a recipe for choosing the appropriate set of filters for a particular application is not the focus of this article, here we provide a high-level guideline. To decide which set of filters is more suitable for a particular application, a number factors such as smoothness of results, widths of filter vectors, the number of vanishing moments of the associated wavelet function, and the support of underlying basis function are taken into consideration. Firstly, when the visual quality of results is important, a set of filters that provides higher level of smoothness is preferred. Secondly, shorter widths of filter vectors imply faster implementation and if applicable, higher frame rate. An interactive focus+context visualization application like the one demonstrated in this article performs more efficiently if the filter vectors are not too wide. For instance, only one level of balanced decomposition of a

                      more multiplications, incurring a 75% increase in the number of multiplications required. Next, higher number of vanishing moments of the associated wavelet function implies wider filter vectors and lesser smoothness of results. However, higher number of vanishing moments allows better approximation of scaling functions, which is desirable in compression applications. Finally, filter vectors that provide compact support lead to better local effects, usually required for applications allowing multiresolution editing.

Daubechies proposed a family of orthogonal wavelets with the highest number of vanishing moments for some expected support but it does not allow for the best smoothness [7]. The filter vectors resulting from this work are asymmetric (see Eq. (B.1), for example). Using a similar idea for construction, Cohen el al. proposed the first family of biorthogonal wavelets, which leads to filter vectors that are symmetric or antisymmetric about their centers [5,8]. The biorthogonal and reverse biorthogonal filters we refer to in Table A.2 resulted from this work. On the other hand, the B-splines filters in Table A.2 are developed by Samavati et al. based on reverse subdivision [26,3,28]. Filters of higher order B-spline produce smoother results. The associated construction procedure starts by setting the width of the decomposition filter vector

                      results in better coarse approximations. Constraints can be set in the construction procedure such that the resulting coarse approximations are smoother. For instance, Sadeghi and Samavati proposed smooth reverse subdivision for obtaining smooth coarse data through decomposition [31,32].

                     , respectively. Because the filter vectors in Eq. (B.1) are not symmetric/antisymmetric, the rewriting task suggested in step 2(c) and that of step 3 in our general construction given in Section 5.2 were not entirely successful. Therefore, our approach could not ensure a perfect reconstruction using only the regular filters from Eq. (B.1).

As we observe in Fig. B.17, this particular example does not require any extraordinary boundary filters for the subdivision matrix 
                        
                           P
                        
                     . This may not always be the case while using other asymmetric filter vectors.
