                  The present work describes indium-zinc oxide (IZO) sputtering depositions onto several types of papers, using radio-frequency (RF) and direct current (DC) sputtering with a ceramic IZO target. The electrical and optical properties of the resulting materials were optimized; by studying the argon and oxygen gas flow rates and the sputtering power effects. At optimal deposition conditions, thin films of IZO were achieved with a low sheet resistance (about 20Ω/sq) and an optical transmittance of ca. 80% in the visible spectrum range. These materials retained these properties for more than 8months. Electrochromic devices (ECDs) with several configurations were built with those conductive papers and life cycling and contrast were measured for the ECDs. These devices exhibited a very good color contrast (as defined using L

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Over the last years, the use of transparent conductive oxides (TCO) has been spread within many applications. Research on this topic has drastically increased and a vast amount of work has been published describing new materials, new deposition techniques and new approaches. This huge response is mostly due to the use of TCO in portable electronics, displays, flexible electronics, multi-functional windows, solar cells, transistors and electrochromic devices, which are a fast growing, market [1].

Nowadays, ECDs are commercially available in the automotive field, in smart rear view mirrors and in smart windows [1]. The employment of ECDs in disposable applications has been evaluated presenting a growing interest in the printed electronics field [2–5]. The ECDs require at least one TCO depending on the final application and on the structure used to build them. The most common choice is indium-tin oxide (ITO) as a thin film sputtered onto glass [6,7]. ITO presents a wide band gap, good electrical conductivity and high transmittance; however, ITO must be deposited at high temperatures and then annealed at a temperature above 300°C for good electrical conductivity and high transmittance. This annealing temperature causes the ITO films to be crystallized and roughened [8]. The annealing step is also necessary to increase the film density and, therefore, to increase the resistance to H2O and O2 penetration and the device lifetime [9]. On the other hand, the use of high temperatures limits the application on flexible substrates like plastic or paper. Because of that limitation, IZO appears as an attractive alternative to ITO films. IZO also has a wide band gap (>3.5eV), good electrical conductivity (>103
                     Ω−1cm−1) and a high transmittance (>80%) in the visible region of the spectrum [1]. Amorphous IZO has a better structural and chemical stability at a relatively high temperature compared to ITO [3]. It can be deposited at room temperature without any annealing step and still be a very stable material [10]; it also has a very low roughness, internal stress [11] and a higher elastic modulus than ITO [12]. Indeed, the elasticity of amorphous IZO makes it adequate to be deposited on flexible substrates. In this work, IZO was deposited onto several types of papers, using RF and DC sputtering. An IZO ceramic target (composition: In2O3:ZnO (87:13wt%)) was used. Since the target is conductive enough, both RF and DC sputtering could be used. Insulating targets require the plasma excitation to be performed by an RF power supply, since with DC excitation no plasma can be ignited. DC power supplies are significantly more cost effective than RF power supplies and, therefore, of these two processes, DC sputtering deposition is the most widely used technique industrially [1]. In the present work, the deposition of IZO with an RF power supply was performed to create a “conductive paper”, while DC power supply-based depositions were used to prove that the process can be implemented industrially. ECDs with several configurations were built with the obtained conductive papers. Life cycle analysis and contrast were assessed. To characterize the deposited films, techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), UV–Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used.

The films were deposited on glass and various paper substrates (pasteboard paper, glossy coated paper and drafting paper) at room temperature by RF and DC sputtering from an In2O3:ZnO (87:13 wt%) alloy target (99.99% purity, from Testbourne, Ltd.) with 7.5cm diameter and 3mm thick.

The depositions were made at INESC-MN on an Alcatel SCM450 sputtering system, with a base pressure of ∼1×10−7
                        Torr maintained by a rotary and turbo molecular pumps. For RF sputtering, power was varied from 40 to 50W, and pure Ar plasma was maintained with Ar flow rates from 20 to 50sccm (standardcc/min). For DC sputtering, oxygen (O2) gas was also incorporated into the plasma at a flow rate of 0.8sccm. Power was set to 40W. The sputter deposition rate was derived from stylus profilometer measurements of film thickness. The typical IZO film thickness ranged from 100 to 200nm. These thicknesses would require long deposition times (30min) and substrate cooling (achieved through copper heat sink substrate holder mounted in contact with a water cooled table) is a key factor. Deficient cooling of the substrate would cause film degradation, with a dark signature rather than transparent.

For printing methods, we have selected screen-printing technique to deposit PEDOT:PSS patterns on flexible PET and paper substrates. The screen-printing equipment used in this study was a manual machine (printable, SAMPAS) and a polyester screen with 140wires/cm. The electrochromic ink was purchased from Heraeus (PEDOT:PSS Clevios S V3 HV) and two layers were deposited on each pattern in order to achieve the desired contrast on the electrochromic colored state.

The main architecture of the devices is shown in Fig. 1
                        , where both electrode and counter-electrode contain the same electrochromic material deposited by screen-printing. Besides paper coated with IZO, the substrate used was also PET coated with ITO, which presents a sheet resistance of 60Ω/sq (purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used as received).

This architecture allows the measurement of light absorption (when the substrate is transparent) between on and off states, since the electrochromic patterns of the electrode and counter-electrode are different. The electrolyte was spread-coated over the electrochromic layer at the electrode; the counter electrode was laminated over the electrolyte, which was then exposed to the ultraviolet 250mWcm−2 UVA radiation for curing, during 1min (Honle UV Technology, UVAHAND 250GS).

The electrolyte formulation is composed by a polymer based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) containing organic groups which promote cross linking of the polymeric chains, a mixture of aprotic solvents, a salt and a photo initiator. The electrolyte was prepared by dissolving the desired amount of salt in the aprotic solvents under stirring in a closed flask at room temperature. The solvents were used as received. When the salt is completely dissolved, the cross-linkable PEO based polymer powder is added to the solution and the components are homogenized with a spatula. The solution becomes a gel when complete dissolution of the polymer in the solvents occurs. This step takes place by leaving the mixture under mechanic stirring for a few hours until the desired solution viscosity is attained (close to 40kcp at room temperature). Then, the flask was protected from the light with an aluminum foil, the photo initiator was added and the mixture was left under stirring for a few minutes, until a homogeneous yellowish gel is obtained. The solid UV electrolyte is transparent and, therefore, does not interfere with the color exhibited by the electrochromic layer.

Two different configurations were tested:

Sheet resistance measurements were performed following the method described in the IEC Standard 93 (VDE 0303, Part 30). Fig. 2
                            represents this method. On top of deposited conductive thin film, two contacts with 1cm length, made with a highly conductive tape, are placed 1cm apart from each other. The resistivity of the film is given by:

To convert this method into an easiest and fastest way of measuring sheet resistance, a homemade wood box was build. This wood box incorporates two metallic contacts with 5cm long and assembled with 5cm distance between them. The metallic contacts are connected to the terminal of a multimeter to read directly the sheet resistance obtained when those metallic terminals are in contact with a conductive surface. The wood structure is used to ensure that the weight of the experimental setup is constant and reproducible.

The optical transmittance measurements were performed using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer Cary 300 Bio in the wavelength range from 380 to 800nm.

The film surface morphology of the bare substrates and the IZO coated substrates was analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (JEOLJSM7001F), in secondary electron mode, at 10.0kV.

Cyclic voltammetry measurements on IZO coated paper were performed in a conventional three-electrode cell. The IZO film deposited on paper was the working electrode, a platinum wire was used as counter-electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was the reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte was acetonitrile with 0.1M lithium perchlorate. The equipment used was a potentiostat/galvanostat Model 20 Autolab from Eco Chemie BV (Utrecht, The Netherlands). The collection of data was controled by GPES version 4.9 Eco Chemie BV software. No IR compensation was used.

To perform this evaluation, a lab-made system was built. A camera, a lamp (to control the luminosity) and a Color Checker accessory (color pattern) were placed inside an isolated box (chamber). The electrochromic device is placed inside this set-up (box) and connected to a function generator. While the function generator applies a selected potential square waveform (changing from positive to negative), the camera is recording, from time to time, 150pictures during a calculated period of time, enough to see a complete redox (oxidation–reduction) cycle of the device (during several hours, days or weeks depending on the durability of the device). The pictures are then treated with a Matlab software converting RGB coordinates obtained from the film into L

The method used to perform mechanical tests (bending) was the Mattia method (ISO 7854-method A) using a De Mattia Flexing tester F15.

The Mattia method is used to test samples for resistance to cracking or cut growth by repeated flexing.

Two samples were tested: a drafting paper with IZO and a PET with ITO, for comparison. The resistance of the tested film was measured during the time of the experiment using a digital multimeter (Agilent 34410).

Two sets of grips on either side of the sample are reciprocated at constant frequency for a preset number of cycles controled by a cycle counter. The electrodes of the multimeter were placed and fixed just after each grip.

Samples are loaded so that they are flat when the grip are tightened and flexed but not elongated during tester operation. The samples were subject to 100 bending cycles at a speed of 5 bending cycles per second. The distance between grips was 70mm±1mm (flat sample) and 13mm±0.5mm (flexed sample), causing a bending radius in the sample of 28.5mm±1mm. The samples were 114mm±1mm long and 20mm±0.5mm large. The contacts were placed 53mm±1mm apart.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, the method followed to optimize the deposited IZO thin film, in terms of transparency and conductivity, is reported describing deposition parameters used with RF and DC power supplies, as well as the results obtained for each experiment and substrate. Table 1
                         lists the results for a RF power supply. The shaded cells, in the table, illustrate the parameter changed from one experiment to the next. The sputtering deposition process was optimized based on the state of the art: for example, it is known that, in general, more power will increase the film thickness and, therefore, the electric conductivity. However, transparency decreases under these conditions (until a certain level, after which the substrate can be damaged). More Ar will increase the conductivity but it may degrade the transparency while O2 will increase the transparency but will decrease the conductivity. On the other hand, a longer deposition time will increase the conductivity but it decreases the transparency of the final material. In order to balance the long deposition times, some stops were made during the process. It is also known that, for RF power supplies with ceramic targets, O2 is not required during deposition, but for DC power supplies the target must be conductive enough to be able to start the plasma and some O2 could be needed, as well [1]. DC power supplies also deposit more material than RF power supplies in the same range of time, using the identical deposition parameters. The RF power supply experimental parameters (power, Ar flow rate, deposition time and stops) are listed in Table 1 and were selected based on previous experience employing sputtering technique. Such parameters were adjusted in the present work to obtain an optimized uniform transparent and conductive film, which was achieved with the conditions of experiment number 6. Afterwards, the parameters applied in this experiment (with RF power supply) were used in the depositions made by DC sputtering (Table 2
                        ). The deposition time was maintained, which increases slightly the film thickness and electric conductivity, as explained above, which required a very low oxygen flow in order to achieve the same optical transparency. Fig. 3
                         compares the evolution of the IZO sheet resistance as consequence of the addition of argon (Ar) in the deposition chamber for RF deposition (only drafting paper) and DC deposition (on drafting paper, glossy coated paper and pasteboard paper).

Using the deposition parameters detailed in Table 2, the optical transmittance of the IZO films was measured on glass samples on the visible range (from 400 to 800nm, see Fig. 4
                        ). On average, high transmittance of ca. 80% in the visible range is achieved, which only degrades for wavelengths below 425nm giving a slight yellowish color which nevertheless still is acceptable for electrochromic applications. Measurements on paper were not performed, but qualitatively those substracts had similar optical properties.

Figs. 5
                        B and 6
                        B clearly show the presence of the IZO thin film on drafting and pasteboard papers, respectively, when those images are compared with bare drafting paper (Fig. 5A) and bare pasteboard paper (Fig. 6A). The surface of the bare drafting paper appears to be relatively smooth but when a IZO is deposited on it (Fig. 5B) a rougher but continuous layer (otherwise the macroscopic electric conductivity would be absent) is seen. The surface of the bare pasteboard paper (Fig. 6A) contains crystallites, which result from a previous surface treatment present already in the as-received samples from the supplier. These additives are typically used for toughening and whitening this type of paper. The pasteboard paper, after IZO deposition (Fig. 6B) exhibits such crystallites completely covered with the IZO grains insuring also a continuity of the IZO layer essential for its electric conductivity performance.

The electrochemical behavior of PET coated with ITO is well known in the scientific community6. It is also considered that the electrochemical limits of this material are well suited for electrochromic applications6. The intention of this sub-chapter is to compare these electrochemical limits to the behavior of paper electrodes in the same conditions to verify if they are also suitable for electrochromism. The cyclic voltammetry was performed using a three-electrode cell configuration, as described above, in a liquid electrolyte (0.1M LiClO4 in acetonitrile) to study the electrochemical stability of the films. The voltammograms obtained (Fig. 7
                        A and B) show that all samples, i.e. IZO coated paper and ITO coated PET (PET-ITO) are stable at positive potentials (up to 2V). However, PET-ITO exhibits a significant increase in negative current intensity starting at −1.2V, while for drafting paper and glossy coated paper this threshold happens for lower voltages (around −1.7V) showing that paper electrodes are electrochemically more stable than PET/ITO. For pasteboard paper, no significant current intensity variation is observed. This behavior was observed both for RF and DC sputtering, meaning that there are no significant differences in electrochemical stability depending on the power supplies used, and assuring the electrochemical stability of the IZO films for typical electrochromic applications. These results are in accordance with tabled reduction potential values for tin and zinc, showing that zinc has a lower redox potential (more negative) and it is probably stabilizing the indium oxide net towards reduction reactions. The substrate is probably also playing a major role; considering that paper is a more porous material than PET, it is probable that less material is reachable to react on paper and that way decreasing the current intensity.

The stability of the electric conductivity as function of time was routinely controled for a drafting paper based electrode (with IZO deposited by DC sputtering). The paper-electrode was kept, during the time of the experiment, inside a desiccator with silica gel and without vacuum, temperature or humidity control. The sheet resistance was determined during 8months using the method described in Section 2.4.1. The maximum value of sheet resistance acceptable for application on electrochromic devices would be 60Ω/sq, which is the typical value of commercially available PET/ITO electrodes. There is no minimum value of sheet resistance preferred for this application. A slight increase of the sheet resistance during this period of time was observed, but it always remained below 60Ω/sq (Fig. 8
                        ). It can also be seen that the intrinsic error associated with the measurement routine is itself rather high, because the homemade wood box with metallic contacts used in these measurements is removed from the sample between each control. Therefore each measurement is not performed at the exact same place than the previous one, leading to this experimental fluctuation between each measurement. Nevertheless, it is possible to conclude that the paper electrodes tested presented a good stability over the experimental time, which was the main objective of this quality control of the product. These results are still rather important to show here, because at least for a time span of 8months the paper still exhibits good electric properties for electrochromic devices. Also the trend of these results does not seem to be linear. It seems that an oxidative degradation happens during this period of time (taking about 50days), but it also “encapsulates” the thin film providing a kind of protective coating from external agents. This explanation is however speculative, requiring additional measurements for a long period of time.

As explained in the experimental section, the devices are symmetric and therefore it is necessary to apply the same potential (but with different polarities) in each electrode, as described previously [5,13]. To compare the performance of the different devices, an applied voltage in a square waveform of 1.5V/−1.5V, during 5s at each potential, was set as the experimental cycling test method.

                         lists the number of cycles performed by each device, described above, and the corresponding device degradation. The degradation was calculated using the ΔE values at the beginning and at the end of the experiment [13]. As explained before, ΔE is defined as the difference in color observed between the reduced and oxidized states of an ECD and it is calculated using L

                        Table 3 also shows the switching response time between the redox states at the beginning and at the end of the experiment, as well as the values of ΔL
                        *, Δa
                        *, Δb
                        * and ΔE used to determine the degradation of the devices [14]. It can be seen that the best results are obtained for drafting paper both in architectures 1 and 4, in terms of performance and response time. These devices show a color degradation of around 22% after 30,000 cycles. In general, this experiment shows that using one or two paper electrodes on the device leads to similar results. It is also evident that the best device performance is not obtained with the most conductive paper (pasteboard paper), while the glossy coated paper leads to the worst performances. These results point out that the overall best performance is obtained with drafting paper, which does not have additives at its surface. Probably the presence of additives leads to secondary electrochemical reactions, which at the long term enhance the device degradation. The same reasoning also seems to apply to the devices switching time.

                        , it is possible to appreciate the performance of the ECD with architecture 1 and architecture 4 respectively (therefore with drafting paper). These images illustrate the two different colored electrodes when PEDOT/PSS electrochromic film is in its reduced state. The color contrast is indeed very high, demonstrating the color contrast measurements shown on Table 3. These encouraging results demonstrate the possibility of producing ECDs for commercial applications: all the layers on the ECDs of Figs. 9 and 10 (TCO, electrochrome and electrolyte) were deposited as described previously, with the possibility of a future scale-up study.

As explained in the experimental section, the Mattia method was used to compare two samples: drafting paper with IZO deposited by sputtering and a commercial sample of PET with ITO. The results can be found in Fig. 11
                        . These results show that the sample of drafting paper with IZO is around 15times more stable than the sample of commercial PET/ITO when subjected to this kind of experiment. Of course, the substrate here plays a major role in these results. However, the objective is to evaluate the possibility of substituting the convencial PET/ITO by another flexible substrate such as paper, and in this case, this experiment is very revealing, showing more flexibility towards bending for the paper sample.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this work we presented the deposition of IZO thin films using RF and DC sputtering on different paper-based substrates with an excellent performance for electrochromic devices applications. The thin films presented sheet resistances around 20Ω/sq (30Ω/sq for drafting paper) with an average transmittance of 80% in the visible part of the spectrum and an electric conductivity stability above 8months, with a slight increase of sheet resistance but still perfectly usable in the suggested application. Being DC sputtering a technique used in industrial environment, it was demonstrated that these results could be implemented in a large-scale production. The devices built on these paper-based electrodes showed a very good performance with 22% of degradation after 30,000 cycles in the best case. It was also demonstrated that having one or two paper electrodes in a device would not affect the performance. It was also demonstrated that paper samples are more flexible towards bending than commercial PET/ITO.
