                  In service systems, in order to balance the server’s idle times and the customers’ waiting times, one may fix the arrival times of the customers beforehand in an appointment schedule. We propose a procedure for determining appointment schedules in such a D/G/1-type of system by sequentially minimizing the per-customer expected loss. Our approach provides schedules for any convex loss function; for the practically relevant cases of the quadratic and absolute value loss functions appealing closed-form results are derived. Importantly, our approach does not impose any conditions on the service time distribution; it is even allowed that the customers’ service times have different distributions.
                  A next question that we address concerns the order of the customers. We develop a criterion that yields the optimal order in case the service time distributions belong to a scale family, such as the exponential family. The customers should be scheduled then in non-decreasing order of their scale parameter.
                  While the optimal schedule can be computed numerically under quite general circumstances, in steady-state it can be computed in closed form for exponentially distributed service times under the quadratic and absolute value loss function. Our findings are illustrated by a number of numerical examples; these also address how fast the transient schedule converges to the corresponding steady-state schedule.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In service systems the service provider would like to minimize costs in terms of the server’s idle times, while the customers would like to be served with minimal waiting times. To accommodate these goals of the service provider and the customers, for example in case of a dentist and his patients, one may fix the arrival times of the customers beforehand in an appointment schedule.

In this paper we consider such appointment schedules aiming at optimally balancing the idle times of the (single) server and the waiting times of the customers. Indeed, if the system is frequently idle, then it is not functioning in a cost-effective manner for the service provider, whereas if it is virtually always busy, then the customers’ waiting times may become substantial. The ‘classical’ objective is then to minimize the system’s risk (in terms of the idle times of the service provider, as well as the waiting times of the clients) by optimally choosing the clients’ arrival epochs. Commonly chosen objective functions are of the type, with

                      of all previous clients. This explains why solving the above optimization problem is hard: apart from numerical approaches, to the best of our knowledge no manageable characterization for the optimal schedule is known. Ideally, one would like to have a tractable solution for arbitrary loss functions (that is, not just the quadratic one) and general service time distributions, to obtain an approach that can be used across a broad range of application areas, such as health care, manufacturing, and other service systems. The general idea behind our paper is that we propose an alternative to the above ‘classical’ optimization framework, in which this all is possible. The idea to work with loss functions that include both idle time and waiting time has found widespread use in the literature; see, among many other references, for example Ho and Lau (1992), Kaandorp and Koole (2007), and Wang (1999).

There is a sizeable literature on appointment scheduling, but the findings tend to be rather case-specific: often one particular loss function is considered that is appropriate for the application at hand, and in view of numerical tractability exponential or Erlang service times are assumed (Fries & Marathe, 1981; Kaandorp & Koole, 2007; Wang, 1999). Besides, many studies rely on simulation to overcome the inherent computational complexity, and to obtain support for specific heuristics, see for example Brahimi and Worthington (1991), and Rohleder and Klassen (2000). These approaches have clear limitations: it is not a priori clear whether an approach that is designed for an application with its specific loss function and service time distribution can be used in other application domains as well. In addition, and more importantly, these approaches do not give the theoretical insight into the nature of optimal schedules.

As pointed out in Mondschein and Weintraub (2003), in order to deal with the opposite interests of the server and the clients, two complementary levels can be distinguished. In the first place, one may facilitate the process environment with features so that waiting time and idle time are either perceived or used differently; note that this is essentially manipulating the ‘disutilities’ of the server and customers. On another level, one defines a loss function, that in some way encompasses the disutilities experienced by both server and customers. Then a schedule needs to be determined that minimizes the expected loss, that is, the risk, thus realizing an optimal trade-off between the agents’ interests. Our work follows the latter approach.

In this paper we propose a sequential optimization approach as a useful and natural alternative to (1). By ‘sequential’ we refer to an approach that determines the i-th appointment time

Importantly, the approach sketched above applies to the quite general class of convex loss functions, and to arbitrary service time distributions. It is neither required that clients’ service times stem from a single distribution, nor that the clients have the same loss function. Where we find for the quadratic loss function that the optimal arrival epoch equals the sum of the means of the sojourn times of the previous customers, for linear loss (that is, the risk function of the i-th customer equalling

                     ) it is the sum of the medians of the sojourn times. In practice one often relies on the heuristic that the arrival epochs are chosen in accordance with the sum of the expected service times of the previous customers, rather than their sojourn times. In light of the above results, it is concluded that this commonly used strategy is suboptimal, as it does not take into account the expected waiting time.

In situations in which all information about all customers is available a priori (i.e., a list of customers to be scheduled, including the distributions of their service times), the logical procedure is to minimize a simultaneous objective function. The applicability of such an approach may severely suffer from the requirement that all this information should be available before a planning can be made: when calling the service provider to make an appointment, customers typically want to hear immediately when they are expected to arrive at the service facility, and they do not want to wait to be assigned an appointment time until the planner has gathered all information needed. In cases the planner does not a priori have all information about all customers that are to be scheduled, one would rather use an approach in which the schedule gradually fills, thus making a sequential policy the more natural setup. For this reason, the sequential approach presented in this paper is particularly useful in any situation in which customers should be given an appointment time immediately, which is a very common situation in e.g. various health care situations (a typical example being the situation of a client contacting the dentist to make an appointment).

The sequential appointment scheduling setup that we consider in this paper, can be viewed as a two-stage procedure. Prior to the, say, day that the actual service is performed, service requests arrive. At this first stage, arrival epochs are assigned to these requests (and potentially these epochs are also put in an optimal order). Then there is a second stage, at which the server executes the actual service.

As mentioned above, our paper succeeds in explicitly solving the sequential optimization problem. Earlier papers predominantly focused on approximations of the joint optimization problem, assuming specific loss functions and service distributions, and resorting to numerical techniques or simulation. We have followed our sequential approach for various reasons. (i) An evidently and very substantial advantage of the sequential approach is that it allows explicit, closed form results, and that it, in addition, enables a solution to the problem of finding the optimal order of the n jobs. In relation to this, solving the sequential scheme is computationally significantly less demanding than the simultaneous optimization problem. (ii) In the second place, as argued earlier, our approach naturally fits the situation in which customers sequentially contact the provider to make an appointment (as opposed to the situation in which a priori all information is available of all customers to be scheduled). (iii) Some clients may be better off under the sequential scheme, some under the joint scheme, but there is no compelling reason why one of the schemes leads to ‘better’ schedules. It is realized, though, that the sequential scheme allows full freedom in terms of the choice of the utility functions related to the individual clients. As a consequence, if, for some reason, it is felt that the risk associated to a specific customer is more important, one can adapt her utility function to reflect this.

The main contribution of the paper is the sequential optimization approach for appointment scheduling, as described above. Apart from the nice features that we already mentioned (applicable for a broad class of loss functions, general service time distributions), it is highly flexible, in that it allows the incorporation of various real-life phenomena such as urgent arrivals and ‘no-shows’. In addition, we quantify the impact of customers arriving early or late, that is, the impact of small random perturbations with respect to the scheduled arrival epochs.

The above results concern the determination of the optimal arrival epochs, for the situation that the order in which the customers are served has been given. A next question concerns the optimal order; this is the second contribution of our work. We prove the appealing result that if all service time distributions concerned stem from a scale family with finite variances, clients should arrive in non-decreasing order of their scale parameter. For instance in the case that the service times obey exponential distributions with mean values

The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents standard scheduling schemes and an overview of the relevant literature; it also further motivates the research reported on in this paper. Section 3 introduces our sequential optimization approach; it includes a proof of the ‘mean rule’ for quadratic loss and the ‘median rule’ for linear or absolute value loss. In Section 4 we address the problem of identifying the optimal order of the clients. Section 5 discusses a number of more practical considerations: it is pointed out how to include additional issues such as urgent arrivals and no-shows, it addresses the effect of small random perturbations around the scheduled arrival epochs, and there is a short account of computational issues. Then, in Section 6 we present some numerical examples. Section 7 concludes.

As mentioned in the introduction, the server and customers have opposite interests: the service provider wishes to minimize the amount of server idleness and is therefore in favor of a ‘dense schedule’, whereas customers are interested in minimizing waiting times and hence prefer schedules in which the slots are relatively long. In this section we provide more background on this tradeoff, as well as a brief literature overview.

                        Due to its simple structure, this standard scheduling scheme is often seen in practice; cf. also Klassen and Rohleder (1996). It has a serious drawback, though: the system becomes essentially a queue with load 1, leading to potentially long waiting times. As a result this scheme might be attractive for the server, but for the customers it is not.

To support this claim, consider for the moment the situation that the

                        , all customers arrive at time 0, thus minimizing the expected idle time at the expense of the clients’ waiting time. On the other hand, it is clear that the mean waiting times in the adapted scheme

                         at the expense of the expected server’s idle time; then the corresponding D/G/1 queue is stable in the sense that it has a proper steady-state distribution.

These observations suggest that one should pick some 
                           
                              Δ
                           
                         larger than 1 in order to find a good compromise between the waiting times of the clients and the idle time of the server, as was also recognized by Ho and Lau (1992) and references therein. It is evident, though, that 
                           
                              Δ
                           
                         does not uniquely predict the customer’s waiting time: a given 
                           
                              Δ
                           
                         can lead to a broad range of waiting time distributions, depending on the service time distribution. Indeed, for 
                           
                              Δ
                              >
                              1
                           
                         deterministic service times lead to zero waiting times, while the waiting times can be quite substantial if the service time distribution has heavy tails. Intuitively, one could anticipate them to increase in the coefficient of variation of the service times. The above reasoning tells us that the schedule should incorporate more detail of the service time distributions than just their means.

To set up the schedule in a sounder way, one could use the concept of ‘risk function’, which measures the aggregate disutility of the server and client. More specifically, the risk associated with the i-th arrival depends on the distribution of the waiting time

                         of the i-th client, as well as the idle time

                        As argued in the introduction, this optimization problem is intrinsically complex, and therefore we propose in the next section to analyze its ‘sequential counterpart’. Before we do so, we first give a brief literature overview.

The literature on appointment scheduling started with the seminal works of Bailey and Welch, see e.g. Bailey (1952), Bailey (1954), Welch (1964) and Welch and Bailey (1952). They proposed a simple schedule that sets interarrival times equal to the average service time, but starts with two arrivals scheduled at time 0. In line with these works, most papers focus on applications of appointment scheduling in healthcare, see Cayirli and Veral (2003) for an extensive overview. We also mention Denton and Gupta (2003), and Mondschein and Weintraub (2003), who discuss a somewhat more general setting.

The usual starting point of this optimization approach concerns the choice of the specific risk. Besides waiting time and idle time, this may include various other performance metrics; see Cayirli and Veral (2003, Table 2) for an overview. It is emphasized that the choice of the loss function and service time distribution is often rather application-specific, and as a consequence of limited use for practitioners in other application domains. This is a distinguishing feature of our work: we allow any user-specific convex loss function, and any client-specific service time distribution. In particular, in our setup the practitioner can pick her or his risk function and apply our approach; evidently, it is beyond the scope of our work to develop guidelines that help choosing a specific loss function for a particular appointment scheduling problem.

Many studies rely on simulation to overcome the inherent analytical and computational complexity, and to obtain support for specific heuristics, such as for example Brahimi and Worthington (1991), and Rohleder and Klassen (2000); in addition we mention Klassen and Rohleder (2004), and Patrick, Puterman, and Queyranne (2008). In Robinson and Chen (2003) the focus is on techniques that facilitate the estimation of the relative cost of the patient waiting time given average queue length and occupation rate. The authors of Begen and Queyranne (2011) devise an efficient scheme to set up schedules for the case that the random service times have discrete support.

There are similarities between appointment scheduling, as discussed in the present paper, and (single) machine scheduling. The main difference between these branches of research is that in appointment scheduling the release dates (in machine scheduling lingo) are to be determined, for a given sequence of jobs. In addition, objective functions used in the machine scheduling literature tend to be quite different from the ones used in the appointment scheduling literature (balancing idle times and waiting times). We refer for an in-depth treatment to the book by Pinedo (2001).

In our sequential counterpart of (5), we minimize, for each i the risk

To ease the exposition, we first present our procedure to find the optimal interarrival times for loss functions that are used most frequently in the literature: the absolute value and quadratic loss functions. Then Section 3.2 shows that this approach essentially carries over to the class of convex loss functions.

Note that the latter proof is reminiscent of that featuring in the well known newsvendor problem, see for instance Hopp and Spearman (1995). Evidently, it can be used to other loss functions as well. Next, we consider the case of the absolute value as loss function.


                        Absolute value loss function. Consider the simple (that is, non-weighted) linear loss function: the risk associated with the i-th customer equals the sum of the expected waiting time and idle time. Again, due to (7) and (8), we obtain

Interestingly, we conclude that the absolute value loss function leads to interarrival times equaling a median of the sojourn times, whereas a quadratic loss function leads to interarrival times equaling the mean of the sojourn times. There is a connection with statistical estimation theory: there one obtains the (sample) median when imposing the absolute value as loss function and the mean absolute deviation as risk, whereas the (sample) mean is found when imposing the square as loss function and the mean square error as risk.

It is noted that the above approach, which is essentially based on Leibniz’s rule, carries over to more general loss functions. We present the resulting general approach in Section 3.2.

We now present our sequential optimization approach for convex loss functions, which contains the cases dealt with in Section 3.1. The approach borrows elements from statistical decision theory; see e.g. Ferguson (1967) or Bickel and Doksum, 2001, chap. 10.

                         can be found by solving the first order condition, as explained in Lemma B.1 in full detail. As for the quadratic and linear case, we can set up a sequentially optimized scheme, in which the arrival epochs can be determined recursively. More precisely, our main result Theorem 3.3 states how to generate the optimal schedule for any nonnegative convex loss function

The loss functions of Section 3.1 can be generalized in the sense that we could relax the equally weighing restriction. As argued in e.g. Ho and Lau (1992), it is sometimes justified to weigh the server’s idle time in a different manner than the client’s waiting time. We here consider both a weighted linear and weighted quadratic loss function.

After having dealt with the optimal schedule for a given order of the clients, the obvious next question is: how should the order of arriving clients be chosen? This question will be addressed in this section.

A commonly used heuristic is that the service times are put in increasing order of variance. The underlying idea is that the variability (in terms of waiting times and idle times) in a D/G/1 system, is exclusively caused by the variability of the service times. When putting the clients with low variability (in their service times) early in the schedule, the uncertainty for clients arriving later is reduced. In this section we study the ordering issue, by deriving a result that confirms the above heuristic. Related results were presented in Wang (1999) for the case of exponentially distributed jobs.

Before going to the main result of this section, we present a simple covariance inequality due to Chebyshev, see Hardy, Littlewood, and Pólya (1934, pp. 43–44) for an overview. Note that this result is known as Chebyshev’s algebraic inequality, see Mitrinović and Vasić (1974), and has been rediscovered several times later, see Jogdeo (1977) and references therein.

In this section we focus on a number of issues that directly relate to implementing our approach in a practical setting. The first subsection covers a number of practically relevant extensions. Then, in Section 5.2 we argue that our scheme has desirable robustness properties with respect to small deviations from the scheduled arrival epochs. This section concludes with a brief account of computational issues.

Before being able to set up a schedule, the service provider has to decide on which objective function he or she wants to use. It is not the objective of this paper to advise service providers on the specific loss function that should be chosen: this is a strongly situation-dependent issue, and reflects the specific policy the service provider has in terms of the grade of service that should be offered to customers. Our methodology is particularly useful when assessing the effect of choosing specific types of loss functions, e.g. linear or quadratic; see for instance Fig. 3 in Section 6, in which this effect has been visualized. In addition, the same figure shows how it facilitates the assessment of the schedule’s sensitivity as a function of the weight 
                        
                           α
                        
                     .

In this section we present a number of extensions of the scheduling scheme developed in the previous sections. We focus on two specific complications, cf. Cayirli and Veral (2003): an additional stream of customers that has to be handled with priority, and the impact of no-shows. Although we discuss the two complications for the case of quadratic loss functions only, the results can be generalized to any convex loss function, in the spirit of Lemma B.1 and Theorem 3.3.


                        Urgent arrivals. A common approach is to model urgent arrivals by adding a random process, see for example Rising, Baron, and Averill (1973), and Swisher, Jacobsen, Jun, and Balci (2001). Consider the model presented in Section 3, but let there be an additional Poisson stream of customers that has to be handled with priority – if the server is busy upon arrival of such an ‘urgent customer’, the job in service is finished before the server starts serving the urgent customer(s). Let urgent customers arrive according to a Poisson process of rate 
                           
                              λ
                           
                        , and let their service requirements

                        Multiple server setting. Our approach can be extended to the case of multiple servers (say s). In this setting the service provider sequentially decides to schedule the next appointment to the server that contributes the least expected loss to the system. This can be implemented by the following iterative procedure. Suppose the i-th customer enters, and the previous 
                           
                              i
                              -
                              1
                           
                         have been assigned an arrival time, and a specific server by whom they will be served. For customer i it is then computed what his optimal arrival time would be, for each of the s possible servers. Then customer i is assigned to the queue with the lowest risk contribution of this customer.

Note that, due to our generic sequential approach, the servers need not be identical, since the approach can deal with distinct service time distributions (which could depend on both client and server). Also remark that in the procedure sketched above it has not been taken into account that each server, in case it idles earlier than expected, could potentially serve customers that are waiting at other queues. In principle, however, the procedure can be adapted to that setting, too, by using a D/G/s-type of queue, which is computationally more involved.


                        Objective function. It is evident that the objective function should include features that involve both the clients’ interests and the server’s interests, and a natural choice is to build the objective function around waiting times and idle times, as we do in this paper. The incorporation of other metrics on top of these is not always possible. Consider for instance the makespan (or session end time), equalling

                        This can be incorporated in the simultaneous approach with linear objective function, but this cannot be done in the simultaneous approach with other objective functions, and not in the sequential approach either. A similar remark applies to the facility overtime. This metric, considered in e.g. Kaandorp and Koole (2007), is defined as the positive part of the difference between the session end time and some scheduled end time T:

In practice the clients’ arrival epochs will slightly deviate from the scheduled epochs. In this subsection we assess the impact of these perturbations, showing how to adapt the schemes identified in Section 3.1. Further results on ‘almost deterministic arrival processes’ are given in e.g. Araman and Glynn (2012), while there is a strong relation to the analysis of the effect of jitter in communication networks as well Roberts et al. (1996, chap. 3).

The setup considered in this subsection, is that a particular client, say the i-th, arrives not necessarily on time. We first study how this affects his optimal arrival epoch, and then we comment on the impact on customers arriving later, that is, customers 
                           
                              i

                              …
                           
                        . We consider the situation that the perturbation around the scheduled arrival time is substantially smaller than the typical job durations. This is realistic in practice; think of a dentist whose check-ups last for instance 15 up to 20minutes, while clients may be one or two minutes early or late. The consequence is that customer 
                           
                              i
                              +
                              1
                           
                         does not take over customer i.

The consequence of the above is that, regarding the optimal arrival time for the i-th customer, the scheme we identified is robust with respect to perturbations in the arrival process. We now briefly consider the impact on the customers arriving after customer i; for ease we focus on the case of quadratic loss. To this end, observe that the departure time of the i-th customer only changes (with respect to the non-perturbed situation) if she is late and the queue is empty when she arrives. As a consequence, the optimal arrival epoch of customer 
                           
                              i

                         in the perturbed case should equal the arrival epoch in the non-perturbed case increased by a small positive quantity; this quantity is the product of the queue being empty upon the arrival of the i-th customer, multiplied by

                         can be determined, but the formulas do not offer any additional insight. In the situation described above, in which the departure of the i-th customer is delayed, the perturbed system matches again with the non-perturbed system as soon as the perturbed system idles.

Our sequential approach requires the availability of a computational procedure to evaluate the customers’ sojourn-time distributions. While such a computation is feasible e.g.for the case of (not necessarily identical) exponentially distributed service times, no explicit results are available for general service time distributions. To overcome this problem, a widely used approach is to approximate the service times by their phase-type counterparts, a class of distributions that allow fairly explicit computational procedures; see e.g. Asmussen (2003). More specifically, following an idea presented in e.g. Tijms (1986), we could replace each customer’s service time distribution by a phase-type distribution with the same mean and variance; for the situation that this distribution corresponds to a coefficient of variation (defined as the ratio of the standard deviation and the mean) smaller than one, a mixture of Erlang distributions can be used, whereas if the coefficient of variation is larger than one, we fit a hyperexponential distribution. For the queue with (not necessarily evenly spaced) deterministic arrivals and such phase-type service times, algorithms can be devised to evaluate the sojourn-time distributions of the individual customers. These algorithms are of a recursive nature: the sojourn-time distribution of the i-th customer can be computed from that of the 
                           
                              (
                              i
                              -
                              1
                              )
                           
                        -st customer. We refer to e.g. Kuiper, Kemper, and Mandjes (2014) for a systematic validation of this procedure, as well as related computational features.

In practical situations, additional requirements will be imposed on the schedule: lunch breaks should be included, all slots should be a multiple of

                         (for instance, 5) minutes, etc. Regarding the latter issue, a pragmatic option would be to round off all the

Above we presented a method to determine the optimal interarrival time given the sojourn time distribution of the previous jobs, for any given convex loss function. To illustrate this method, we discuss a set of examples. Although the method works for all service time distributions, we consider the exponential case for its attractive computational properties; extensions to phase-type service time distributions are feasible, as discussed in Section 5.3.

We first consider ‘steady-state schedules’: if all jobs stem from the same distribution, then the schedules prescribe that the customers should arrive equidistantly in time. We denote the risk per customer in the steady-state for loss function 
                        
                           ℓ
                           (
                           ·
                           )
                        
                      at interarrival time x by 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 ℓ
                                 )
                              
                           
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                     . We present closed-form optimal interarrival times for the various loss functions introduced above. Then we verify the legitimacy of the use of steady-state results, which is particularly relevant in case the number of jobs is relatively low. In the third example, we compare our sequential approach with the simultaneous optimization program (1). Finally, we study the impact of the weight

                        Example 6.1
                        In this example we consider the effect of scheduling policies 
                              
                                 U
                              
                            and 
                              
                                 V
                              
                            by considering the situation of i.i.d. service times, and the number of jobs n being large. Our goal is to compute the limiting interarrival time for both scheduling policies.

We assume that the service times are exponential with mean 
                              
                                 1
                                 /
                                 μ
                              
                           , so that the queue under consideration is an D/M/1. Let x be the interarrival time between two subsequent jobs; it is evident (cf. Proposition 2.1) that we should have x larger than the average service requirement 
                              
                                 1

                           . Then the distribution of the steady-state waiting time W is given through Asmussen (2003) and Tijms (1986).

                                    , we conclude from the above that under the quadratic loss function the scheduling is somewhat more conservative than under the linear loss function.

Finally, we consider the weighted-quadratic loss function. The use of (17) and the constraint on

In this example we analyze the speed of convergence of the various scheduling schemes by considering the situation of i.i.d. service times exponentially distributed with mean 1, and the number of jobs n being relatively small. For each scheme we analyze the speed of convergence; that is, we investigate the difference between the sequentially optimized interarrival time and the asymptotic regime as studied above.

                            for all jobs reduces the expected waiting time for the jobs early in the schedule (but at the expense of increasing the server’s idle time). The example indicates that simple heuristics, in the spirit of “schedule the first five jobs at 95% of the steady-state interarrival time and the rest of the jobs at steady-state interarrival time”, are close to the optimum and easily applicable for practitioners.♢

We now compare the output of our sequential approach with that of the simultaneous program (1). In the latter approach one obtains the clients’ optimal arrival times through the simultaneous optimization

                           As mentioned in the introduction, this simultaneous approach is numerically typically harder than our sequential counterpart, the most substantial advantage of the latter scheme being that only single-dimensional optimizations need to be performed. For the special case of exponential service times, the objective function in (19) can be evaluated once we have a procedure to compute the number of customers present at

In case the number of jobs n is relatively small, we are able to numerically analyze the optimal transient interarrival times relying on Wang’s algorithm Wang (1999). Wang’s algorithm enables us to find the distribution of the number of customers in the system at the arrival times

Our findings are depicted in Fig. 2
                           , together with the steady-state result as well as the results of the sequential approach from the previous example. We observe that all jobs, except for the last one, are scheduled less tight with the simultaneous approach than with the sequential approach. Furthermore, for the sequential approach the optimal interarrival times are increasing and converge towards the steady-state optimal interarrival time

                            affects the schedule, for the situation of identically distributed exponential service times.

In appointment scheduling, rules are needed that assure a good trade-off between quality (in terms of the customer’s waiting time) and cost (in terms of the server’s idle time). In this paper we presented a technique to generate such rules.

More specifically, these rules are based on an approach that sequentially minimizes risks and which can be used to determine a schedule, for any convex loss function and service time distribution. In this framework, one should schedule jobs in the order of increasing variances, for convex loss functions with scale families of service time distributions. Also, the scheduling rules presented here can be extended to cover real-life phenomena such as no-shows, urgent arrivals, and the effect of small perturbations of the arrival epochs.

We demonstrated the approach by four representative examples. In the first we considered a system with a large number of customers, so that the system can be effectively replaced by its steady-state version. In case of exponential service times there are closed-form expressions for the steady-state schedule, whereas the transient schedule can be determined relatively easily relying on basic standard mathematical software; we do so for (possibly weighted) linear and quadratic loss functions. The numerical output illustrates the impact of the choice of the loss function on the interarrival times. In the second example we show how fast the transient schedule converges to the steady-state schedule. Numerical experiments indicate that simple heuristics perform well. In the third example we compare our approach with the joint approach that was described in the introduction. The last example numerically assess the impact of the weight parameter 
                        
                           α
                        
                     .

The methodology presented in this paper can be used across a broad range of application areas, such as health care, manufacturing, and other service systems, in situations that primarily focus on setting up an appointment schedule. In addition, it may shed light on provisioning issues (that is, decide how many jobs can be scheduled per server per working day, or, similarly, how many servers should be allocated on a working day to process the scheduled appointments). It is clear that our approach can be used to check whether it is realistic to schedule a given number of n appointments on a working day (based on knowledge of the service time distribution of each job), and in this way it can be used to support provisioning and staffing decisions.

A next step in this branch of research would be a study in more detail of both the sequential and the simultaneous approach for a D/G/1 system and various loss functions. These issues, as well as the extension to more complex queueing networks, such as tandem or parallel queues, are topics for future research.
