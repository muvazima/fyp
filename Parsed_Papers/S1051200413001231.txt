                  For the detection of a weak known signal in additive white noise, a generalized correlation detector is considered. In the case of a large number of measurements, an asymptotic efficacy is analytically computed as a general measure of detection performance. The derivative of the efficacy with respect to the noise level is also analytically computed. Positivity of this derivative is the condition for enhancement of the detection performance by increasing the level of noise. The behavior of this derivative is analyzed in various important situations, especially showing when noise-enhanced detection is feasible and when it is not.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recently, the employment of noise in enhancing the performance of signal processors has emerged as a topic of significant interest [1–11]. This notion is rooted in the concept of stochastic resonance (SR) that was first elucidated in the area of climate dynamics [12]. The attraction of SR is that an appropriate non-zero noise level can improve, rather than degrade, the performance of nonlinear systems [13–19]. So far, several static nonlinearities arising in various signal processing problems were shown to exhibit a noise-enhanced effect, such as quantizers [7–11] and nonlinear detectors [1–4,20–30]. Now, this method of enhancement via noise is still under investigation as a technique with useful potential for nonlinear signal processing.

In this letter, we focus on the detection enhancement of a weak signal in additive white noise by a generalized correlation detector. With a sufficiently large observation size, the detection performance of the detector is determined by the normalized asymptotic efficacy 
                        
                           
                              ξ
                           
                           
                              GC
                           
                        
                      
                     [31]. We show that both the efficacy 
                        
                           
                              ξ
                           
                           
                              GC
                           
                        
                      and its derivative with respect to the noise level can be analytically computed. This derivative and its condition of positivity are analyzed in various important situations, allowing us to conclude when increasing the level of noise can improve the detection performance, and when it cannot. The result provides not only an easily implemented criterion for exploring the role of noise in detectors, but also the operational levels of noise that we can employ.

                              , the addition of uniform noise is helpful for weak signal detection, as shown in Fig. 2(b). We see that the normalized asymptotic efficacy can be improved up to

                              , we can tune the threshold λ to maximize the normalized asymptotic efficacy

                              [23,29–32]. Michels et al. demonstrated that the normalized asymptotic efficacy of the tuned dead-zone limiter detector with optimal threshold

                               cannot be improved by adding noise to the signal [30] (Section 5.3, pp. 33–35). For the case of where the threshold is not optimal, they further proved that the optimal detection performance can be achieved by adding independent dichotomous noise [23]. For a fixed threshold λ, Corollaries 2 and 5 apply our general characterization to the dead-zone limiter detector for any type of scaled noise. The optimal noise level can be solved by Eq. (13) and Eq. (32).

                              ), no enhancement by noise can take place. In this respect, our results here accord with the conclusions of [29,30] that the normalized asymptotic efficacy of the dead-zone limiter detector with optimal threshold cannot be improved by adding noise, but the SR effect is possible when the threshold is not optimal for the initial given noise level.

The constructive role of internal noise has been adequately reappraised for improving the performance of an array of nonlinearities [3,4,7–10]. Compared with an isolated nonlinearity, the performance of an array can be much improved by the internal noise [3,4,7–10]. Moreover, the positive role of noise does not need to occur for an isolated nonlinearity, but can come into play in a parallel array of nonlinearities [4,7–10].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we study the noise-enhanced detection of a weak known signal in additive white noise. For a sufficiently large observation size, the performance of a generalized correlation detector is determined by the normalized asymptotic efficacy 
                        
                           
                              ξ
                           
                           
                              GC
                           
                        
                     . Then, the positive derivative of 
                        
                           
                              ξ
                           
                           
                              GC
                           
                        
                      with respect to the noise level indicates the occurrence of the noise-enhanced detection effect. According to this condition, we arrive at some interesting conclusions on whether the role of noise in a generalized correlation detector offers an enhancement or not.

We here only consider some analytical nonlinearities, e.g. the dead-zone limiter nonlinearity and the locally optimal nonlinearity. There are other interesting nonlinearities such as the saturation nonlinearity [34] and the soft-threshold nonlinearity [35], which can be of interest for further studies of weak signal detection in the context of SR.
