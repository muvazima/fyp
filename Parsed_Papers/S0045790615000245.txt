                  In this article, we investigate the performance of a coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multi-carrier (MC) system in underwater communication, where acoustic interference and ambient noise are the two major channel impairments. The channel model considered in this work is based on the shallow water model that has eleven paths. In our work, the acoustic signal is spread with the aid of a high rate spreading sequence to alleviate the effects of acoustic interference. At the receiver, non-linear detectors based on Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) are employed for signal detection. The simulation results reveal that the system under consideration with the MMSE detector provides better performance in terms of the achievable bit error rate than the system with the ZF detector while achieving higher data rates.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The transmission of information in underwater communication is a challenging issue because it is affected by noise from various sources that include man-made noise (shipping) and natural noise (rain, wind and seismic). Further, multipath propagation and acoustic interference have great impact on the signal transmission in underwater communication. Due to multipath propagation, signals in underwater channels experience inter-symbol interference (ISI). In a typical radio frequency (RF) communication orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is widely employed to combat the effects of ISI, because OFDM obviates the need for complex equalization techniques. In addition, OFDM can be called upon to deal with the effects of ISI in underwater communication. Of late, in RF communication, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system has been employed to increase the capacity of the wireless channels. The information theoretic capacity of the MIMO system increases linearly with an increase in the number of antennas. This increase in capacity is achieved without calling for additional bandwidth and power. That is, MIMO can be operated in a spatial multiplexing mode to achieve higher data rates. This benefit offered by the MIMO system can also be exploited in underwater communication. Hence, in this article, we consider an MIMO–OFDM system aided by turbo code for the transmission of signals over underwater channels.

Recently, underwater communication has received substantial attention in both the academia and industry because it offers a wide range of interesting research problems that need to be addressed, for example, acoustic channel modeling and ambient noise modeling. In [1] the author presented various sources that contribute to acoustic noise and demonstrated their spectrum. It is also shown that there is a linear relationship between the noise spectrum and wind speed. In addition, it is reported that there is a correlation between wind speed and noise level. In [2], time-domain modeling of turbo coded underwater communication that achieves a better bit error rate (BER) performance has been addressed. In [3], Karasalo investigated the performance of a single-carrier turbo coded system for underwater communication with the aid of time-domain ray-tracing modeling. The author also considered that the OFDM symbol duration is longer than the multipath spread to overcome the effects of ISI in underwater communication. In [4], Akyildiz and his team discussed different architectures for an underwater sensor network and highlighted the research challenges. In [5], Wang et al., proposed a stratified acoustic model based on frequency-dependent geometrical ray tracing to determine the phase shifts in underwater acoustic networks and proposed that it is possible to predict the transmission loss with fewer computations.

In this article, we consider a system that combines OFDM and MIMO and exploit the advantages of an iterative decoding algorithm for underwater communication and investigate its performance in terms of the achievable BER. To be specific, we investigate the BER performance of our considered system in the context of underwater communication by employing non-linear detectors such as Zero-Forcing–Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation (ZF–OSIC) and Minimum-Mean-Square-Error–Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation (MMSE–OSIC) at the receiver to combat the effects of acoustic interference.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the system configuration. Section 3 gives the essence of symbol detection techniques. Section 4 elucidates the performance results and discussion. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 5.

                      transmit antennas and that each of the receivers is equipped with Nr
                      receiving antennas.

Finally, the cyclic prefix is added to mitigate the effects of inter-carrier interference and is then transmitted from the antennas. Suppose, we assume that the sub-carriers experience flat fading, then the channel state information (CSI) vector connecting the ith transmit antenna and the jth receive antenna can be expressed as

However, in this contribution, we investigate the performance of the considered system in a frequency-selective underwater communication channel by invoking a realistic channel model detailed in [6,7]. Hence, in this context, the fading coefficient connecting the ith transmit antenna and the jth receive antenna can be expressed as

In ZF–OSIC, a set of all possible symbol decisions is ranked according to the pre-computation of weight vectors [9,10].

                        The detected acoustic information is de-spread by the transmitter-specific spreading sequence and is de-interleaved and decoded by the turbo decoder based on the Log-MAP decoding algorithm [11]. Finally, the acoustic data are estimated.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, we present the simulation results of the considered system when communicating over shallow underwater multipath acoustic channels [8]. The simulation parameters are summarized in Table 2
                      and the channel model parameters are summarized in Table 1. Further, the transmitter height is assumed to be 10m, the receiver height is assumed to be 5m, the distance between the transmitter and receiver is assumed to be 80m, and channel depth is assumed to be 20m. Furthermore, the wind speed and ship activity factor are assumed to be 10knots [12] and 0.1, respectively. A carrier frequency of 18.5kHz, sampling frequency of 55.5kHz, Doppler shift of 9Hz and an IFFT size of 64 are also considered in our simulation. We have considered three iterations for the coded system and assumed that the perfect CSI is available at the receiver.

                      illustrates the BER performance of the uncoded MIMO–OFDM system with the ZF–OSIC detector. From the figure, we note that to acquire a BER of 10−3, the system with the ZF algorithm requires an SNR of 38dB.


                     Fig. 4
                      depicts the BER performance of the uncoded MIMO–OFDM system with the MMSE–OSIC detector. From the figure, the MMSE algorithm requires an SNR of 36dB to achieve a BER of 10−3. From Figs. 3 and 4, we observe that the uncoded MIMO–OFDM system with the ZF–OSIC algorithm produces a BER of 10−3 for an SNR of 38dB whereas the MMSE–OSIC algorithm achieves a better BER performance of 10−4 for the same SNR.

                      represents the BER performance of the coded MIMO–OFDM system with the MMSE–OSIC detector. From the figure, we observe that the MMSE algorithm requires an SNR of 5.1dB to achieve a BER of 10−4.


                     Fig. 7
                      shows a comparison of the BER performance for the coded MIMO–OFDM system with the ZF–OSIC and MMSE–OSIC receivers. From the figure, we observe that to produce a BER of 10−3, the ZF–OSIC detector requires an SNR of 5.1dB, whereas the MMSE–OSIC detector requires only 3.5dB.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this article, we investigated the performance of a coded MIMO–OFDM system for underwater communications. We considered a realistic channel model based on a time-varying wideband channel with long delay spreads. It is observed that the path-dependent Doppler and angle spread introduce an error floor in the BER performance. It is discerned from our simulation that an iterative decoding algorithm based on Log-MAP provides an achievable BER performance with less SNR. Our simulation results reveal that the coded MIMO–OFDM system with a non-linear detector based on MMSE–OSIC provides a superior performance than the ZF–OSIC detector in terms of the achievable BER by mitigating the effects of ISI and acoustic interference while offering higher data rates.
