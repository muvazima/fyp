@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Fashion design is an industry closely connected to our lives. When a designer proposes a variety of design ideas, determining how to specifically present these ideas is an important consideration. Currently there are two methods used in the development of apparel products: one is plane cutting, and the other is three-dimensional cutting. In methods based on plane cutting, the basic pieces required for fashion design are generated by mannequin forms, and patterning is performed through adjusting the scale of the shaped cutting pieces. By contrast, in three-dimensional cutting, designers directly come up with the garment designs on the mannequin to obtain the shaped cuttings of the 2D pieces required for production. Therefore, no matter which method is adopted for fashion design and development, all of the mannequins used by the design profession are important media for the concretization of design ideas; more specifically, the process is not only closely related to garment wearing fitness, but also affects the final appearance. On the other hand, human factors of the target consumer are also an important basis for the selection of mannequins. These data are determined by the sizes and relative positions of each feature line of the human body on the mannequin. In addition, for the same human factor measurement, the same mannequin form is not definitive, which further adds the complexity of the mannequin design. Generally speaking, fashion brands define the standard mannequin model based on consumer-related data, and then develop various mannequins of different sizes, thus creating the unique characteristics of each individual brand through garment cut, in addition to style design. Therefore, the selection of a suitable mannequin is an important step in the process of apparel product development. Once a mannequin is selected, details of the overall design can then be quickly and specifically presented.

When applying the 3D mannequin to the computer-aided fashion design, the mannequin should be designed based on different functions for different component levels. In the process of fashion design and manufacture, the mannequin not only completely represents the features and measurements for each portion of human body, but also corresponds to the need of customers with different figures. For this reason, each feature curve of the model has typical and specific significance, which allows the design of garments to be manufactured  [1]. On the other hand, when a mannequin is applied to a garment display, the role of the mannequin is to accurately realize the display of 3D garments in the real world. Therefore, there is a demand for mannequins that can describe human features and figures; moreover, the mannequin should be able to display fashion design in different postures to showcase the characteristics of the garments. The target of this study was to develop a module for the generation of a 3D mannequin which can be applied to fashion design and manufacture and then realize the concept of 3D mannequin-aided fashion design. Hence, there are two main technical problems being addressed in this study: (a) how to generate a 3D mannequin of different sizes; and, (b) how to directly generate the control mesh for fashion design on the 3D mannequin. In these issues, how to generate different apparel surfaces by shape morphing, based on the relative control mesh defined and transformed by the position of the feature curves, is considered in this study. Other than the situation mentioned above, how to generate the design components of sleeves and pant legs from a 3D mannequin without mesh cutting and sewing is the other focus of this study. Through these issues, a method for surface reconstruction of a 3D mannequin based on feature curves is proposed in this study, where the reverse engineering methods are applied to scan the concrete mannequin. Through this technique, the surface partitions, which are segmented on the surface of the mannequin and defined by feature curves, can be constructed. More specifically, the surface partitions can obtain the grid points that represent the form features from the extraction of scanned points. Next, 
                        B
                     -spline surfaces are selected to reconstruct the form of the entire 3D mannequin, and to ensure that the computation of surface fitting is more stable, the Gauss–Newton algorithm is applied. Meanwhile, revising the continuity of the interface among the 
                        B
                     -spline surfaces with the tangent vector adjustment method based on the minimum energy is adopted to integrate surfaces with different features into a unity. When the form of the 3D model is transformed by adjusting the input of human factors, the whole 3D model can be composed of different blocks due to the surface partition. Without making changes for the features, the method mentioned above can generate different 3D mannequins of different sizes by scaling. Therefore, other design components can be generated on the original 3D model by a means analogous to assembling a brick wall, the application of which can be tailored for the construction of sleeves or pant legs. Finally, the 3D mannequin based on the proposed methodology is applied to a developing platform for computer-aided fashion design to verify the practicality of the study.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section  2 presents the literature review and highlights the current limits and necessary improvements. Section  3 details the methodology of this study, while Section  4 implements a case study of surface reconstruction for a 3D mannequin. Section  5 offers the results and discussion, with Section  6 providing conclusions potential trends for future research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Today, advances in information technology have made computer-aided fashion design a popular research topic. There is ample space for creativity in all of the design, manufacture, display and performance links of the industry. However, during the process, determining how to obtain the required mannequin is a problem that cannot be ignored. Using reverse engineering methods to scan the mannequin required for fashion design is the most common solution  [2–4]. The whole mannequin model can be reconstructed based on semantic features and parametric surfaces, and then the shape surface can be unfolded to obtain the 2D pieces required by plane cutting techniques, which is an important function of 3D mannequins  [5,6]. However, if the appearance of a human body can be directly scanned  [7,8], not only would the measurement results of individual sizes be obtained, but the parametric design based on the statistical data could also be carried out to obtain the respective 3D mannequin for any size  [9]. Although attaining the proper grouping of, and reconstruction from, the scanned data according to features are major challenges in the process, drawing on the 3D mannequin to generate 3D virtual clothing  [10,11] can unleash the advantages of computer-aided design to achieve product development using synchronous design methods. This is also the goal that has been jointly sought by many related studies, especially studies on how to enable computer-aided fashion design to better fit design practices  [12].

In the process of surface reconstruction from scanned data, using parametric surfaces to represent the entire 3D mannequin is a highly efficient procedure, which can also provide a variety of geometric information to help solve problems. Before surface reconstruction can begin, determining how to divide the scanned data into appropriate blocks using shape features  [13,14] and re-simplifying the entire scanned data using slicing methods  [15,16] are the most important preparations. When parametric surfaces are needed for the shape reconstruction of already partitioned blocks, the use of interpolation to obtain the minimum energy is a relatively common method  [17–21], which is also widely used in the reconstruction of various parametric surfaces. However, ensuring both real-time and accuracy are challenges for algorithm design. In addition, although gradually obtaining optimal results by adjusting the control points of the parametric surfaces is an alternate solution  [22,23], using a genetic algorithm for the reconstruction of parametric surfaces is a new method  [24]. When all parametric surfaces of the entire shape have been obtained, the continuity of surface convergence becomes an important challenge as it directly affects the quality of the surfaces, thereby raising different requirements related to different levels of continuity  [25–30]. Altering the surface control grid using parameters, and thus obtaining different results under conditions in line with the same continuity, is a more flexible method  [31]; however, ensuring that such corrections do not lead to transition errors is another obstacle to overcome. Finally, to simplify the alternation of the parametric surface forms, reducing the number of surface control points is a feasible option  [32]. However, if shape-blending methods can be applied to systematically change the shapes using parameters  [33,34], the varied requirements in fashion design concerning 3D mannequins suitable for different individual sizes can thus be met.

From the above related research, how to propose a suitable module for constructing a 3D mannequin is the target of this study, in particular for 3D mannequin-aided fashion design and the algorithm for the stable surfaces fitting, so that the research result could be applied to the computer-aided fashion design.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

The mannequin is a very important tool in fashion design (Fig. 1
                        (a)), enabling quick realization of various design ideas, especially in formulating individual sizes. The entire mannequin was composed of several feature curves (Fig. 1(b)), which include the neck girth, shoulder line, bust girth, waist girth, hip girth, side line, shoulder, center line, princess line, etc., all of which have their specific measurement locations. Based on these feature curves, a variety of garment design techniques can be accurately carried out, thereby ensuring that the resultant products are in line with the targeted individual sizes. In order to systematically process the size scaling of 3D mannequins with ergonomic parameters, several dotted curves are adapted to the form reconstruction as the auxiliary curves for data partitioning. This results in the primary form model being partitioned by feature curves and then transforms the 3D mannequin form composed of a brick-piling data structure. Furthermore, the meshes for shape morphing are generated on the surface of every brick, as shown in Fig. 1(c). This makes the management and application of the 3D mannequin data systematic because the sections of specific forms are represented by every brick.

Through this module, the relation among the 3D mannequin data is built by the relative positions of the bricks while the attribute of layers is contained. When conducting the scaling process of 3D mannequins, the sets of bricks ready to be calculated are derived from the feature measurements of the related data (Fig. 2
                        (a)). Several ergonomic parameters for shape morphing are defined through the 3D mannequin constructed in this study (Fig. 2(b)), where the process not only represents the shoulder width 
                           W
                           1
                        , waist width 
                           W
                           2
                        , and hip width 
                           W
                           3
                        , but also the difference, 
                           H
                           1
                           –
                           H
                           5
                        , of heights and the range of girths for each feature profile. Shape morphing of the 3D mannequin includes two stages: scaling of the feature profile and the shape morphing of the related brick data. Scaling of the feature profile includes the adjustment of width and depth; when conducting the width scaling of the feature profile, the point O is the center of the profile, which is applied to the scaling process in the 
                           X
                        -axis direction (Fig. 2(c)). Hence, when conducting the depth scaling of the feature profile, the point O is the center of the profile which is applied to the scaling process in the 
                           Z
                        -axis direction (Fig. 2(d)). Through this method, and after the width of the profile is determined, the girth of the profile is adjusted by the process for the scaling of depth 
                           D
                        , especially for the three girths of a human body. When the scaling process of each profile is complemented, the scaling ratio could be applied to the calculation for shape morphing of related bricks, where the difference of the measured heights is the height of each brick. Then, the extension of the brick is conducted in the 
                           Y
                        -axis direction based on the center O (Fig. 2(e)).

To conduct the process of the shape morphing of a 3D mannequin based on the scaling of feature profiles on the bricks, a weighted blending method is adopted in the study. Shape morphing is the process of continued transformation between two shapes or forms that also includes the conversion of shape features. In order to contain the process continuity, the weighted arithmetic mean method in Eq. (1) is applied to calculate the degree of scaling in every axial direction and then generate the output of shape morphing with the specific form features remaining.

When the weighted blending is applied to the waist shape morphing of the 3D mannequin based on the brick-piling data structure, a result as in Fig. 3
                         is obtained. While adjusting the scaling ratio of the waist profile, the scaling ratios of other profiles on the related bricks are calculated by the weighted blending method (Fig. 3(a)). This leads to a new waist form being generated according to these scaling ratios (Fig. 3(b)). After the shape morphing of the partial forms is complete, a new 3D mannequin is built again (Fig. 3(c)). Through this module, the shape morphing of a 3D mannequin is concurrently generated while simultaneously retaining the scaling of feature profiles with the primarily geometric features.

Surface reconstruction is used to obtain the control mesh of a parametric surface based on a curve fitting algorithm, where the form reconstruction based on a 
                           B
                        -spline surface is proposed in this study. To ensure the accurate and efficient computation, the calculation is proposed as follows.

In mathematics, curves can be generated by the interpolation of polygon vertices, which can be achieved by choosing a suitable basis function. The 
                           B
                        -spline curve is a parametric curve accurately generated using this method, whose mathematical formula can be expressed by the function of parameter

Therefore, as long as the control points of a group of polygons are available, the point coordinates on the entire curve can be generated by multiplying the selected basis functions, making shape changes flexible. This procedure can thus be used to generate diverse shapes. In this study, however, to clearly express the contents of the method mentioned, Eq.

The surface fitting computation method is then used to obtain applicable parametric surfaces, as shown in Fig. 4
                        . First, it is necessary to obtain the grid point array subject to fitting from the scanned data using the slicing method (Fig. 4(a)); subsequently, more refined curve points are calculated using the curve fitting method in the 
                           u
                         and 
                           v
                         directions of the point array. Next, the polygon-like control net of the 
                           B
                        -spline surfaces of these grid points is obtained (Fig. 4(b)). And finally, Eq. (15) can be used to obtain high-quality 
                           B
                        -spline surfaces (Fig. 4(c)).

When a shape needs to be formed by multiple surfaces, and in order to obtain surfaces with high-quality shapes, the continuity of parametric surface convergence is the primary consideration. Parametric surface convergence can be divided into position continuity (G0), tangent-plane continuity (G1) and curvature continuity (G2) by its different extents; therefore, only when low-order continuous conditions are met can the possibility of high-order continuity be explored. Here, ensure that

                         are the basis functions. Therefore, for the discussion of subsequent issues, these two surfaces share the same number of control points and order on a common border.

On the other hand, during the process of continuity correction, the first order differential and second order differential vectors in the 
                           u
                         and 
                           v
                         directions on the common border connecting the two surfaces need to be calculated (Fig. 5). As the surface is an extension of the curve in the biparametric directions, these can be obtained by the differential equation of the 
                           B
                        -spline curve. After a set of control point coordinates is given, the first order differential result of each point on the 
                           B
                        -spline curve thus generated can be obtained by the computation in Eq. (18):

From the variables of Eq. (19), it can be seen that the order 
                           k
                           ≧
                           4
                         is a necessary condition for the second order differential calculation. The differential results of the entire 
                           B
                        -spline curve are as shown in Fig. 6
                        . Fig. 6(a) is the 
                           B
                        -spline curve generated by the control points, Fig. 6(b) is the first order differential results of each point on the curve, namely the tangent vectors, and Fig. 6(c) is the vectors of the second order differential calculation of each point on the curve. Therefore, when differential equations are used to check the continuity of the surface convergence, surface convergence results in line with the continuity conditions can be obtained by adjusting the control point grid of the surface, which is the main method for surface continuity correction.

                            of the sum of squares of the minimum error can thus be calculated using the numerical method in Eq. (8).

For the detection of surface continuity, the continuity extent of two connected surfaces can be directly calculated using Eq. (36); beyond that, inspection of the reflection lines of the zebra mapping is another common method, especially in computer-aided design and manufacturing. When it is necessary to understand the quality of the surface shape, zebra patterns can be superimposed over the surface (Fig. 11
                           ) to check the continuity of the current surface according to the reflection line shown by the stripes. When the surface convergence reaches only G0 continuity, the reflection lines on their common border have no connection (Fig. 11(a)). When surface convergence reaches G1 continuity, the reflection lines on their common border are connected, but show significant changes or differences (Fig. 11(b)). However, if surface convergence reaches G2 continuity, the reflection lines show a changing continuity and overall feel (Fig. 11(c)). Ultimately, surface quality can be efficiently examined by adopting this method.

This study proposed reconstructing the surface of a 3D mannequin based on feature curves using 3D mannequins to link the entire computer-aided fashion design system and further enhance the application levels of computer-aided fashion design. The procedure is described in the following.

How to obtain grid points for surface fitting computation is the first step for constructing the 3D mannequin, the steps of which are as follows.


                        Step  1: Application of reverse engineering methods to scan the mannequin model.

In order to the record the shape features of the mannequin in detail, using reverse engineering methods to scan the actual mannequin is the most direct and efficient solution. The method is initiated by scanning the selected mannequin used by the design profession with a non-contact scanner to completely record the 3D point data of the mannequin, as shown in Fig. 12
                        (a). In fact, the 3D mannequin’s form data comprised relatively large and cluttered 3D grids; the noise and tool traces generated in the scanning process still needed processing with professional software (Fig. 12(b)).


                        Step  2: Applying the feature curves of the mannequin to the form of the 3D mannequin.

Two methods were adopted to apply the various feature curves defined in the fashion design to the 3D mannequin. The first is the slicing method, which partitions the 3D model and defines it by planes, decomposing it to plenty of slices. This method is mainly applied to the acquirement of feature curves such as the center and side lines, and the bust, waist and hip girths for the mannequin. The second is the project method, which projects previously drawn 2D curves onto the 3D model (Fig. 13
                        ). At first, setting up the endpoints and crosspoints on the surface, which will be crossed and connected by a 
                           B
                        -spline, and then the 
                           B
                        -spline curve is constructed by fitting these points. In this process, the fitted curves will be influenced by the tangent vector on the endpoints and the number and positions of crosspoints. After that the intersections of the surface and the projection lines in the direction toward the set viewpoint are calculated, and the intersections are later projected onto the 3D model. Meanwhile, the curves can be handled with several segments based on the condition of C1 continuity. The whole process depends on repeatedly inspecting the projection results to produce the curves for the 3D surface and is applicable and suitable for the obtainment of another feature curves. The primary result of the projection method is demonstrated in Fig. 14
                        (a). Furthermore, the application of the slicing method for generating continuous equidistant slices beneath the bust girth of a model is shown in Fig. 14(b). Finally, the data of equal grid points scatter around the segment contour generated by the surface partition in the same direction (Fig. 14(c)).


                        Step  3: Applying the blending method to the generation of other grid points based on the boundary condition composed of feature curves.

The left portion of the mannequin bust girth should be sequentially processed by the surface partitions based on feature curves. Projecting the contour points for every mannequin section on a 2D plane previously was the very first process (Fig. 15
                        (a)). Then apply the blending method to calculate the 2D coordinate of each grid point (Fig. 15(b)), as illustrated by

                         Finally, the grid points for the whole 3D mannequin can be obtained by projecting these grid points back to the 3D model (Fig. 15(c)).

This study aimed to reconstruct the various grid blocks partitioned according to the feature curves based on 
                           B
                        -spline surfaces, and by using the systematic method proposed, these blocks were computed one by one to obtain the control grid of the represented 
                           B
                        -spline surfaces. Eventually, a 3D mannequin form presented completely using a 
                           B
                        -spline polygon mesh was obtained (Fig. 16
                        (a)). In order to obtain high-quality surface shapes, the 3D mannequin formed by the 
                           B
                        -spline polygon mesh needed to be subject to continuity correction of the surface convergence. After correction of the control grids according to the different continuity components, 3D mannequin surface results in line with G0 continuity, G1 continuity and G2 continuity were obtained. When a design system requires the use of 3D mannequins, the designated parameter 
                           t
                         could be incorporated according to the mathematical equation of 
                           B
                        -spline surfaces to obtain the surfaces of the 3D mannequin shape (Fig. 16(b)), which is highly efficient for retaining the 3D mannequin data, especially under a variety of different hardware and software conditions. In addition, as shown in Fig. 16(c), the entire 3D mannequin surface could be loaded into the 3D software to review and analyze the continuity of surface convergence based on the reflection lines of the zebra mapping, in which only the continuity at the shoulder part needed correction with low-order G0 continuity conditions due to the fact that in garment design, this part is required to be cut for the arms to pass through. In other parts of the surface, the reflection lines follow the changes in the shape to generate mapping effects with regular density, which is the evidence of curvature continuity. The application of the proposed systematic approach enabled the originally independent 
                           B
                        -spline surfaces to be integrated into an overall 3D mannequin shape. Simultaneously, geometric information required for design could be calculated from these control grids.

The application of the proposed surface partitions based on feature curves allowed the 3D mannequin to be defined and performed as various blocks that were piled and built (Fig. 17
                        (a)). Thus, other mannequins could be constructed by alternate ways or orderings of the block piling after the module of the 3D mannequin is complete (Fig. 17(b)). When the weighted blending method is applied to the scaling of a 3D mannequin, a subject could be ergonomically measured in simple dress, as shown in Fig. 18
                        (a). 3D scanning of a human body is a direct and accurate measurement method (Fig. 18(b)). Through scanning, ergonomic parameters defined in this study are then obtained and applied to generate the customer oriented 3D mannequin by the shape morphing of relative bricks (Fig. 18(c)). On the other hand, when generating the fashion design components from the 3D mannequin, the basic form of the components could also be constructed by block piling. As shown in Fig. 19
                        , and based on the standard 3D mannequin, the form for the arms could be generated to complete the later sleeve design (Fig. 19(a)); additionally, blocks representing the legs and the control mesh for trousers design could be extracted from the segments of the standard 3D mannequin as well (Fig. 19(b)). By applying this form generation module to fashion design, the required standard templates could be generated efficiently.

When the form of fashion design components is generated from a 3D mannequin, the control mesh, which can adjust in size, for the garment form design could be duplicated from the form construction of the 3D mannequin (Fig. 20
                        (a)). Similarly, the mesh contains the same data computing structure as the 3D mannequin, so the blocks could then be transformed in the segment of any direction (Fig. 20(b)); thus, the fashion design could be processed by shape blending (Fig. 20(c)). Further, the form surface can be designed by the subdivision of mesh (Fig. 20(d)), and with the implementation of this design module, various forms of trousers could be designed by the 3D mannequin (Fig. 21
                        ). Through the module of this 3D mannequin, the original feature curves of a concrete mannequin could be reconstructed on a 3D fashion design display and become the index of shape morphing based on the blending method. Therefore, a variety of design styles could be developed based on human factors, which is the presentation for the application of 3D mannequin-aided fashion design. On the other hand, the 3D mannequin could also be applied to 3D virtual garment simulation (Fig. 22
                        ) to show the appearance of a clothing design with different fabrics, colors and patterns in real-time, to achieve the purpose of product development using synchronous methods which require no production of real clothing samples.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

A module for constructing 3D mannequins is proposed in this study, in which the 3D mannequins in different sizes can be generated by inputting the scales of different ergonomic parameters. In this method, the iteration of fitting computation for the surface reconstruction can be steadily performed based on the Gauss–Newton algorithm. After revision of the interface continuity among the 
                        B
                     -spline surfaces, the individual sections partitioned by feature curves could be reconstructed as an integral form of a 3D mannequin. In the module, the 3D mannequin with different ergonomic parameters could be systematically scaled with the bricks based on the weighted blending method.

Several improvements with respect to the state of the art for this study are described as follows.

a. The continuity of multi-surfaces
                  

Due to the last form being partitioned into sections of several sizes based on the feature curves, the continuity revision among surfaces for this kind of free form was made quite important. Further, the control mesh with the G2 continuity was revised by the iteration method based on the minimum energy proposed in this study, the process of which led every section to be blended into unity again. In the phrase of the continuity of multi-surfaces, a stable and efficient method for revision toward the real condition was proposed. The method was different from other related works which merely reached the G1 continuity or discussed the continuity between two connected surfaces. The mannequin constructed with the proposed method can offer more accurate information related to surfaces, which benefits for applying to computer-aided fashion design.

b. The reconstruction of 3D mannequin based on feature curves
                  

In fashion design, all of the mannequins used by the design profession are important media for the concretization of design ideas. This study applied various feature curves defined on the human body to form the 3D mannequin. Based on these feature curves, a variety of garment design techniques can be accurately carried out. In addition, other design components can be generated on the original 3D model by a means analogous to assembling a brick wall, the application of which can be tailored for the construction of sleeves or pant legs. Through the ontology, the design methods which were habitually used by fashion designers were applied to the phrase of computer-aided fashion design, this make CAD system a profitable tool for product development but an obstacle of a new tool.

c. The adjustment of a 3D mannequin
                  

The proposed 3D mannequin reconstruction module is based on the form of a professional mannequin and generates various 3D mannequins by shape morphing with feature curve measurements. Through this methodology, the original significance or features are retained in the reconstruction of a mannequin, where the garments are designed and correspond to the requirements of major size ranges for customers, without limitations of different customer figures. The module for shape morphing of a mannequin differs from other related works which were based on the shape morphing of human features; the study is based on ergonomic parameters, which were measured with the common way in fashion design. This made the shape morphing method more suitable to be applied to the computer-aided fashion design.

To our knowledge, how to convert the ergonomic parameters into a 3D mannequin is an important work in fashion design, and the methodology proposed in this study provides an important foundation of this potential work.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Computer-aided clothing design is a design mode requiring reconsideration. The existing 3D software based on forward design cannot meet the needs of apparel product development, especially in terms of feasibility in the wearing of the garment. In contrast, when reverse design methods are adopted, accurate body size data can be obtained, but not the practical needs of the design as high data processing capacity is still required, which is a big challenge for apparel designers. However, in fashion design, the mannequin plays a key role in allowing the rapid concretization of design ideas. To enable 3D mannequins to link the development and application of the entire computer-aided fashion design system, this study has proposed a set of systematic methods for the reconstruction of the 3D mannequin based on feature curves, thus allowing 3D mannequins of different sizes to be generated by scaling with the input of human factors. Most importantly, the integration of feature curves into the surface construction of the 3D mannequin allows many fashion design techniques to be continuously applied to computer-aided design systems, with full play given to their advantages.

In the direction of future developments, the concept of mannequin-aided fashion design can be comprehensively converted into platforms for computer-aided fashion design systems in a sustainable manner to directly generate all kinds of garment forms visualized by designers using the constructed 3D mannequin. This would not only reduce difficulties in producing 3D garment designs, but also effectively improve the efficiency of product development to achieve wearing fitness of the garment, which is a direct method for ensuring design feasibility. On the other hand, since there are two main techniques in fashion design, namely cutting and sewing, a fashion design system with a three-dimensional tailoring architecture could be achieved when these techniques are actualized in a 3D design interface. Therefore, the 3D mannequin is an important foundation for these concepts.
