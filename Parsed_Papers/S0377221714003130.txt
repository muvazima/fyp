                  In many branch-and-price algorithms, the column generation subproblem consists of computing feasible constrained paths. In the capacitated arc-routing problem (CARP), elementarity constraints concerning the edges to be serviced and additional constraints resulting from the branch-and-bound process together impose two types of loop-elimination constraints. To fulfill the former constraints, it is common practice to rely on a relaxation where loops are allowed. In a k-loop elimination approach all loops of length k and smaller are forbidden. Following Bode and Irnich (2012) for solving the CARP, branching on followers and non-followers is the only known approach to guarantee integer solutions within branch-and-price. However, it comes at the cost of additional task-2-loop elimination constraints. In this paper, we show that a combined

                     -loop elimination in the shortest-path subproblem can be accomplished in a computationally efficient way. Overall, the improved branch-and-price often allows the computation of tighter lower bounds and integer optimal solutions for several instances from standard benchmark sets.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In thiAlgorithms paper, we extend the works of Irnich and Villeneuve (2006) and Bode and Irnich (2012). The first paper considered k-cycle elimination for shortest-path problems with resource constraints (SPPRC, Irnich & Desaulniers, 2005, chap. 2). The elementary SPPRC (ESPPRC) is the subproblem of many column-generation formulations of routing problems. Since the ESPPRC is 
                        
                           NP
                        
                     -hard in the strong sense (Dror, 1994), early column-generation approaches solved the SPPRC, i.e., the corresponding non-elementary problem, or SPPRC with 2-cycle elimination (see, e.g. Houck, Picard, Queyranne, & Vemuganti, 1980, 1999), which are both relaxations, with the consequence that the lower bounds computed by the column-generation master program often deteriorate. The elimination of k-cycles, i.e., cycles with up to k edges, can be seen as a mean to gradually strengthen the linear relaxation of the column-generation master program while keeping the computational effort acceptable. Both from a practical and a worst-case point of view, k-cycle elimination is computationally attractive because there exist pseudo-polynomial labeling algorithms (Irnich & Villeneuve, 2006). Applied to the vehicle-routing problem with time windows some knowingly hard instances were solved for the first time. Nowadays, it seems that approaches based on solving ESPPRC (e.g. Jepsen, Petersen, Spoorendonk, & Pisinger, 2008) or ng-path relaxations (Baldacci, Mingozzi, & Roberti, 2011a) are superior due to the extremely tight lower bounds produced. However, when routes become very long, solving even very few ESPPRC subproblems can become extremely time consuming (see e.g. Desaulniers, Lessard, & Hadjar, 2008).

We apply loop-elimination for solving the capacitated arc-routing problem (CARP) with the branch-and-price algorithm of Bode and Irnich (2012). The CARP is the basic multiple-vehicle arc-routing problem. It has applications in waste collection, postal delivery, winter services and more (Corberán & Prins, 2010; Dror, 2000). For a general overview on exact algorithms for the CARP we refer to the survey (Belenguer, Benevent, & Irnich, 2014, chap. 9). In the paper (Bode & Irnich, 2012), the first full-fledged branch-and-price algorithm for the CARP was presented. It can be characterized by the idea of exploiting sparsity of the underlying CARP network. The advantage of sparse networks is that new CARP tours can be priced out efficiently using the sparse network only (see also Letchford & Oukil, 2009). Bode and Irnich (2012) discussed that the sparse network however comes at the cost of a more intricate branching and they developed an effective branching scheme based on follower and non-follower constraints. It means that for every two required edges e and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 e
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                     , one determines whether or not these two edges are serviced by the same vehicle and with no other intermediate service in between. Follower constraints, i.e., two edges e and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 e
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                      have to be serviced consecutively, can be enforced by network modifications so that these constraints preserve the structure of the pricing subproblem. However, non-follower constraints, i.e., two edges e and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 e
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                      must not be served consecutively, can only be implemented efficiently as a task-2-loop elimination constraint: The trick is to associate the same task to both edges e and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 e
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                      (see also Irnich & Desaulniers (2005, chap. 2) for a discussion of tasks and task cycles). Hence, this branching scheme seemed limited to the case that an SPPRC subproblem with 2-loop elimination is employed (the term loop refers to cycles w.r.t.services edges; a 2-loop is the repetition of the same service). Moreover, Bode and Irnich (2012) showed that pricing relaxations based on k-loop elimination can produce better column-generation lower bounds. However, a key question remained unclear: How can the branching scheme with branching on followers/non-followers be combined with k-loop elimination for 
                        
                           k
                           ⩾
                           3
                        
                     .

A positive answer will be given here because we can show that a combined 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           2
                           )
                        
                     -cycle elimination accomplishes the above problem. More precisely, k-loops w.r.t.tasks associated with services on required edges and 2-loops w.r.t.tasks implied by non-follower constraints can be handled by a labeling approach presented here. Note that the companion paper (Bode & Irnich, in press) studies several alternative relaxations including, e.g., extensions of the afore-mentioned ng-path relaxations. Its focus is the empirical comparison of these relaxations, the analysis of the impact of possible acceleration techniques, and the overall comparison of the different branch-and-price algorithms. Please note that the article at hand and the paper (Bode & Irnich, in press) were originally one long technical report (submitted and available online on our website in November 2012). Due to its length the paper was not publishable so that we decided to split it into two parts. We (re)submitted both parts in April 2013 when a new paper by Bartolini, Cordeau, and Laporte (2013) became online available. Therefore, we consider results presented here and in Bartolini et al. (2013) as developed independently; the computational results section however compares also explicitly with their (very good) results.

The contribution of this paper is therefore twofold: First, we provide the theoretical foundation of a labeling algorithm allowing the combined 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           2
                           )
                        
                     -loop elimination. This includes the definition of labels, the derivation of an effective dominance procedure, and a worst-case analysis. Second, we run the different branch-and-price algorithms for the CARP resulting from choosing different values of k, i.e., for 
                        
                           k
                           =
                           2
                           ,
                           3
                        
                     , and 4. It will be apparent that the controlled variation of k is beneficial when it comes to a comparison concerning the trade-off between the strength of a column-generation formulation and the computational burden for its resolution.

We expect that the branch-and-price-based approach, presented in this paper here, applies also for solving other vehicle-routing problems (VRP) defined on a sparse networks: Examples are the capacitated general routing problem (typically defined on a sparse graph Pandi & Muralidharan (1995) and some variants of the VRP defined on street networks (e.g., Nasiri & Letchford, 2013)).

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the new labeling algorithm and its theoretical analysis for SPPRC with combined 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           2
                           )
                        
                     -loop elimination. Section 3 presents computational results for using the respective relaxations as subproblems in a branch-and-price for the CARP. The paper ends with final conclusions in Section 4.

A general discussion of SPPRC solution approaches including a detailed discussion of dynamic programming labeling algorithms, at the moment the generally best performing methods, can be found in Irnich and Desaulniers (2005, chap. 2). Solution approaches tailored to ESPPRC are presented in Feillet, Dejax, Gendreau, and Gueguen (2004), Boland, Dethridge, and Dumitrescu (2006), Righini and Salani (2006, 2008).

The outline of a generic labeling approach for solving SPPRC is presented in Algorithm 1. Herein, each path P is represented by a label 
                           
                              L
                              (
                              P
                              )
                           
                        , i.e., a data structure that allows the reconstruction of the associated path via labels of the predecessor path, provides additional information such as the resource consumption 
                           
                              r

                        , and allows to invoke a dominance algorithm. The set 
                           
                              U
                           
                         is the set of unprocessed labels

                              (
                              v

                              (
                              P
                              )
                           
                        . The set 
                           
                              L
                           
                         contains those labels that need to be kept.

                           Generic SPPRC Dynamic Programming Labeling Algorithm 
                                 
                                    
                                 
                              
                           

Depending on the path selection rule in the path extension step, different label processing procedures result such as label setting and label correcting algorithms. The invocation of a dominance algorithm is optional in the sense that otherwise the algorithm enumerates all feasible paths starting at node 
                           
                              s
                           
                        . Dominance is however crucial in the design of efficient labeling algorithms, and we devote Section 2.3 for the detailed presentation of this basic component. In general, the intension of the dominance algorithm is to identify those paths that do not need to be extended, i.e., one or several other paths still allow finding (Pareto-) optimal paths. It can be applied at any time in the course of the algorithm and might be delayed to a point where several new paths with identical end node have been generated and stored in 
                           
                              U
                           
                        . Any reasonable strategy for invoking the dominance algorithm will optimize the tradeoff between the computational effort and the risk that a path is extended before one finds out that it is dominated.

In the presence of additional path-structural constraints (such as cycle- or loop-elimination constraints discussed in Section 2.2, see also Section 2.2 of Irnich & Desaulniers (2005, chap. 2)), the set 
                           
                              L
                           
                         must generally include additional labels for paths that are not necessarily Pareto-optimal. It this case, a final filtering step is needed to identify a Pareto-optimal subset. Efficient algorithms for that purpose can be found in Bentley (1980).

In the column-generation context, a task is something (such as visiting a node, edge or arc) that needs to be performed by a column (a vehicle route or a schedule etc.). Generally, a task is associated with a set-partitioning or covering constraint of the master program, and it can be found at one or several nodes and arcs of the network. The work by Irnich and Villeneuve (2006) mainly addresses k-cycle elimination where every node of the subproblem’s network represents an individual task (implied by standard node-elementarity constraints).

The paper at hand, however, addresses the more general case that an arbitrary sequence

                                    ij
                                 
                              
                           
                         of tasks (including empty sequences) is associated with every arc

                         does not contain a task-k loop. It is important to highlight that the literature distinguishes between k-cycles and k-loops. The term k-cycle is traditionally used in the context of unique tasks associated with nodes. A 2-cycle is a cycle of length two such as

                        , and a k-cycle is any cycle of length k or smaller. In contrast, a 2-loop is a repeated task

                         a task-k-loop is task-cycle of length 
                           
                              k
                              -

                         or smaller.

The rationale behind these seeming confusing definitions is that 2-cycle elimination and task-2-loop elimination can be handled with almost identical algorithmic approaches: Dominance rules require that only a best and a second-best path with different last task need to be kept in 
                           
                              L
                           
                         (see Algorihm 1). The dominance rules were first presented by (Houck et al., 1980) for 2-cycle elimination in the node-routing context and by (Benavent, Campos, CorberÃ¡n, & Mota, 1992) for task-2-loop elimination and the CARP.

This section contains new theoretical results for labeling procedures that simultaneously consider two sets of tasks for which loop freeness must be guaranteed. In our CARP application, paths are desired to be k-loop-free w.r.t.tasks 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    T

                         induced by route’s elementarity constraints. Here, we would like 
                           
                              k
                              >
                              2
                           
                         to be as large as possible (of course there is the trade-off between strength of the relaxation and effort for pricing). Moreover, one needs paths to be exactly 2-loop-free w.r.t.the tasks

                         induced by non-follower constraints resulting from branching.

                         labels at the same node and otherwise identical state (all resources except for cost; identical load in the CARP case). Irnich and Villeneuve (2006) discuss this point for node-k-cycle elimination in detail. Therefore, the decisive point is the development of effective dominance rules guaranteeing a small number of labels.

Such an effective dominance rule, based on the one for node-k-cycle elimination proposed by Irnich and Villeneuve (2006), does not only compare pairs of paths. Instead, several paths together may be needed to dominate another path. In the following, we will distinguish between paths and labels. Paths are represented by labels, but labels contain additional attributes needed to efficiently test for domination. Moreover, paths can mutually dominate each other, while we will make sure that dominance is uni-directional among labels. This can be achieved using a unique identifier (an ID) for each label, which breaks ties whenever two labels with identical resources are compared (for a more detailed discussion of that point see Irnich & Villeneuve (2006, p. 393f)).

The dominance principle says that labels

                           so that the condition (2) for loop-free extensions can be equivalently stated with the help of self-hole sets. The point is now that any intersection of the self-hole sets, resulting on the right hand side, can be calculated and represented as a union of set forms again. The following theorem summarizes the result:

With the above definition of the intersection of two set form, we are able to formally define the intersection of two hole sets

                           . Algorithm 2 is similarly stated in Irnich and Villeneuve (2006, p. 398). Note that the first loop is included for the purpose of accelerating the subsequent steps, i.e., to produce fewer set forms s and t in the preliminary result set H having s included in t or vice versa. Such included set forms are eliminated in the last loop. Overall complexity of Algorithm 2

In order to know the overall time complexity, it is important to quantify the maximum number of elements present in an intersection of two collections of set forms. The next paragraph will give an answer.

For node-k-cycle elimination, any collection of set forms resulting from the intersection of self-hole sets does not contain more than 
                              
                                 (
                                 k
                                 -
                                 1
                                 )
                                 
                                    
                                       !
                                    
                                    
                                       2
                                    
                                 
                              
                            different set forms. This result is stated in Irnich and Villeneuve (2006, p. 399) for node-k-cycle elimination. Notice that in node-k-cycle elimination all paths ending at the same node share an identical last task (corresponding to that node), which therefore can be omitted. Task-k-loop elimination, however, must ensure that there are at least 
                              
                                 k
                                 -
                                 1
                              
                            other tasks before a task is repeated. Therefore, in both cases, recording only 
                              
                                 k
                                 -
                                 1
                              
                            elements is sufficient to encode all relevant dominance information, which results in the stated complexity.

For the labeling algorithm, it means that the running-hole set is stored within the label for bookkeeping already identified dominance relations. Whenever one or several new labels are created (by the path extension step, see Section 2.1), they are compared for dominance with the existing (old) labels that are already present at the same node. If a new label

The extension is split into two parts, the extension along all deadheading arcs first and the extensions along all service arcs second.

The first extension (deadheading) produces only labels with identical load

By pre-assigning minimum-cost labels at all nodes, the time complexity

                     -loop free relaxations on the computation time and the overall best lower bound achieved at the end of the branch-and-price. The branching scheme presented in Bode and Irnich (2012) consists of three levels of branching decisions: First branching on non-even node degrees, and second branching on edges with fractional edge flow. Both decisions have no impact on the structure of the pricing problem. The third decision is branching on follower information, whenever the information if two edges are serviced consecutive is fractional. This branching rule, however, modifies the network of the underlying graph of the pricing problem. In particular, it requires a second task set to be handled in the SPPRC labeling algorithm that solves the pricing subproblem.

For the branch-and-price, no initial upper bound is given and the node selection rule in branch-and-bound is best-bound first. Note that the same formulation of the (restricted) master problem is used as in Bode and Irnich (2012), while for the pricing subproblem the following modifications are made: Whenever possible, the simple k-loop elimination pricing is used. If, however, any non-follower constraints is active, the simple k-loop elimination pricing is replaced by

                     -loop elimination pricing. Moreover, we use standard heuristic pricing procedures and acceleration techniques for exact pricing as presented in the companion paper (Bode & Irnich, in press). The two acceleration techniques applied are bounding with the 2-loop elimination relaxation and bi-direction labeling; for details we refer to Mingozzi, Bianco, and Ricciardelli (1997), Baldacci, Mingozzi, and Roberti (2011b, 2011a), Righini and Salani (2006).

The computational study uses two standard benchmark sets from the literature: The first benchmark set egl was introduced by Eglese and Li (1992) and can be downloaded from http://www.uv.es/∼belengue/carp/. This set consists of 24 instances based on the road network of Cumbria. The first 12 instances have 77 nodes and 98 edges, whereas the remaining 12 instances are larger and have 140 nodes and 190 edges. Instances with the same graph size further differ in the number of required edges and the vehicle capacity. The second benchmark set bmcv consisting of 100 instances is obtained from the road network of Flanders, Belgium (Beullens, Muyldermans, Cattrysse, & van Oudheusden, 2003). These instances range from 26 to 97 nodes and 35 to 142 edges, where only a subset of the edges is required. The instances were kindly provided by Muyldermans (2012) and the transformed instances into the standard format can be downloaded from http://logistik.bwl.uni-mainz.de/Dateien/bmcv.zip. These instances comprise four subsets, where the underlying graph for individual instances of subset C and E is identical, but the vehicle capacity is 300 for the C set and 600 for the E set. The same holds for the subsets of instances named D and F.

All computations were performed on a standard PC with an Intel

                      Core™ i7-2600 at 3.4GHz processor with 16GB of main memory. The algorithm was coded in C++ (MS-Visual Studio, 2010) and the callable library of CPLEX 12.2 was used to iteratively reoptimize the RMP. A hard time limit of four hours for computation has been set for the column-generation and branch-and-price algorithms.

Since a comprehensive study of linear relaxation results for k-loop elimination with and without activated acceleration techniques are presented in Bode and Irnich (2012), Bode and Irnich (in press), this section focuses on integer results obtained when the branch-and-bound ends (either with an optimal solution or when the given time limit is reached).

                      for the bmcv instance E11 (written in bold also) result from new best integer solutions found with branch-and-price.

For the egl-instances, average lower bound values increases with increasing k: The average gap for 2-loop relaxation is 
                        
                           0.54
                        
                     , while it is 
                        
                           0.46
                        
                      and 
                        
                           0.43
                        
                      for 3-loop and 4-loop, respectively. There are four exceptions (e4-a, s3-a, s3-b and s4-a) where 2-loop relaxation results in better lower bound when the time limit of four hours is reached. Regarding the computation time, 2-loop relaxation performs better for the group of smaller instances (egl-e), while the two optimal solutions in the second group (egl-s) are computed fastest with 4-loop relaxation. Overall, three new best lower bounds are obtained for e2-b, e3-b and e4-c with 3-loop and 4-loop relaxation.

For the subsets D and F of bmcv instances, 2-loop relaxation gives the best results both regarding bounds and computation times, meaning that the number of best lower bounds and optimal integer solutions is the highest. Moreover, on average the computation times and the gap is also smaller compared to 3-loop or 4-loop. However, for the subsets C and E with smaller vehicle capacity, results are different: While the number of best lower bounds is still highest with 2-loop relaxation, 3-loop produces for the subset C the same number of integer solutions and the same average gap. Moreover, the average computation time decreases for 3-loop. Within the subset E, 4-loop relaxation results in more best lower bounds and obtains more integer solutions than 2-loop. Moreover, the average computation time and gap are also smaller for 4-loop than for 2-loop.

Overall, we are able to obtain 19 new best lower bounds out of 33 previously unsolved bmcv instances (5 for subset C, 4 for subset D, 6 for subset E and 4 for subset F). Thereof, 15 instances (C04, C19, C21, C24, D08, D14, D19, E11, E16, E19, E20, E24, F04, F08 and F12) are solved to optimality for the first time. Bartolini et al. (2012) mentioned that the objective value is always a multiple of five. Using this fact, optimality can be proven also for instances D23 and F23.

In comparison to the recent results presented by Bartolini et al. (2013) (developed in parallel to our algorithm), their approach produces some impressive results: They improve five lower bounds for the egl instances where we improve three. Interestingly, the algorithms are complementary, since improvements of both approaches are made on seven different instances. For the bmcv instances, they improve the lower bounds for 11+8+5+5=29 instances, where we improve 4+6+4+4=18. Moreover, they deliver 6+7+4+5=22 optimality proofs, while we prove optimality in 4+5+4+4=17 cases.

At the end, 12 egl instances and 10 bmcv instances remain open.

It was known from the work of Bode and Irnich (2012) that task-k-loop elimination can significantly improve bounds of the linear relaxation of the column-generation master program. However, branching, i.e., a genuine branch-and-price was not possible due to the branching rule implying 2-loop elimination constraints on a new task set. The new results using the SPPRC subproblem relaxation with task-

                     -loop elimination allow for a comparison of overall computation times and lower bounds when the branch-and-price algorithm terminates. Using standard benchmark set, we have shown that the approach is competitive: Several new best lower bounds were presented and some knowingly hard instances were solved to proven optimality for the first time.
