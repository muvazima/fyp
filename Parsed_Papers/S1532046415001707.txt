                  Coronary artery disease (CAD) often leads to myocardial infarction, which may be fatal. Risk factors can be used to predict CAD, which may subsequently lead to prevention or early intervention. Patient data such as co-morbidities, medication history, social history and family history are required to determine the risk factors for a disease. However, risk factor data are usually embedded in unstructured clinical narratives if the data is not collected specifically for risk assessment purposes. Clinical text mining can be used to extract data related to risk factors from unstructured clinical notes. This study presents methods to extract Framingham risk factors from unstructured electronic health records using clinical text mining and to calculate 10-year coronary artery disease risk scores in a cohort of diabetic patients. We developed a rule-based system to extract risk factors: age, gender, total cholesterol, HDL-C, blood pressure, diabetes history and smoking history. The results showed that the output from the text mining system was reliable, but there was a significant amount of missing data to calculate the Framingham risk score. A systematic approach for understanding missing data was followed by implementation of imputation strategies. An analysis of the 10-year Framingham risk scores for coronary artery disease in this cohort has shown that the majority of the diabetic patients are at moderate risk of CAD.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Coronary artery disease (CAD), also known as coronary heart disease, is a leading cause of death worldwide [1,2]. CAD is caused by accumulation of plaque in the coronary arteries. Severe blockage of the coronary arteries by plaque can lead to myocardial infarction, which can be fatal. CAD is the most common type of heart disease observed in the general population and the incidence of CAD is rising globally [3]. The costs involved in managing CAD are significantly high, creating an enormous burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Thus, it is important to predict patients at risk of CAD. CAD prediction can assist clinicians to provide early intervention and consequently prevent the development of CAD [4]. CAD risk assessment is part of various national and international clinical guidelines [3,5,6]. The risk assessment is usually done with the help of scoring systems. There are various CAD risk scoring systems available and some of them are specifically modeled for a particular group of patients. The Framingham risk score (FRS) is one of the most popular and well-accepted risk scores to predict CAD. FRS was developed as part of the Framingham heart study. One of the aims of this study is to develop predictive models to estimate probabilities of developing various cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases [7]. The FRS for CAD provides the probabilities of individuals, aged 30–74years, to develop CAD. The prediction made with this particular model is valid for 4–12years. FRS for CAD is calculated using risk factors: age, gender, total cholesterol, or low-density lipoproteins cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL-C), blood pressure (BP), diabetes history and smoking history [8].

With the rapid adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems, most of the data from patients are stored in electronic format. Necessary data is difficult to obtain in retrospective research studies because the data is scattered across various systems in different formats. Often the risk factor data required for determining FRS are buried in unstructured discharge summary clinical notes. This leads to a problem since most FRS calculators available online require manual input of structured data [9,10]. Entering data manually for a single patient is no trouble but it could be time consuming when this is done for thousands of patients. Extracting the required risk factor data and calculating FRS manually from unstructured EHRs, can be very expensive and resource intensive. Clinical text mining can be used to extract relevant unstructured data and convert it into structured data which can then be used to calculate the FRS.

In this study, we present methods to calculate the FRS from unstructured EHRs using clinical text mining. We retrospectively calculated the 10-year CAD risk scores for a cohort of diabetic patients. Similar studies reporting CAD or cardiovascular risk assessment using EHR data can be found in the literature [11–14]. While these studies provide comprehensive risk models for identifying diabetic patients at risk of CAD, most of the studies used structured data collected specifically for CAD risk assessment. On the other hand, CAD risk assessment using unstructured EHR data has not been well discussed and, to the best of our knowledge, there have not been any studies for calculating FRS for CAD using text mining. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of assessing the risk of CAD from unstructured EHRs using clinical text mining. Specifically, this work presents a system to extract necessary information from unstructured EHRs needed to calculate the FRS. Additionally, the study aims to understand the distribution of calculated FRS in diabetic patients. It is hypothesized that patients who develop CAD will have higher FRS as compared to the ones who do not develop CAD.

Unstructured EHRs (from here on referred to as corpus) were obtained from the i2b2 2014 shared task 2 which deals with identifying risk factors for heart disease over a period of time [15]. The corpus is de-identified and specifically annotated for heart disease risk factors [16]. The corpus also contains valuable temporal information (up to five encounters) like demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics such as age and weight, and billing details. The corpus includes 1304 unstructured EHRs from 296 diabetic patients. The 296 diabetic patients are stratified into three groups based on when they developed coronary artery disease (CAD). The three groups are: (i) patients who develop CAD over a period of time, (ii) patients who do not develop CAD and (iii) patients who have already been diagnosed with CAD. Although the EHRs were de-identified, the time progression was maintained in the form of adjusted dates. The time between the first and last record for patients was calculated to understand the length of their medical history (Appendix A).

                         demonstrates the steps carried out to calculate the 10-year FRS for CAD. All the risk factors required for calculation of 10-year CAD FRS were extracted using a text mining system specifically developed for this study. An error analysis was conducted to understand the output obtained from the text mining system. Cohort selection was performed to determine patients eligible for calculating FRS. Systematic assessment was carried out to understand the quality of data. Various imputation strategies were employed to address missing data. Following the imputations, the 10-year CAD FRS was calculated for eligible patients. Finally, analysis was performed on eligible patients by stratifying them according to their CAD status. The key steps involved in the workflow are explained in the following sections.

The system developed for determining coronary artery disease risk scores (Fig. 2
                        ) is an extension to our work for i2b2 2014 shared task track 2 [17,18]. The developed system consists of three major components, namely FRS risk factor extraction component I, FRS risk factor extraction component II and post-processing component. The first two components include sub-components. FRS risk factor extraction component I and post-processing component were specifically developed for this study. Unstructured EHRs were processed through FRS risk factor extraction component I and II at the same time. After which the output was passed to the post-processing component for further processing.

FRS risk factor extraction component I and its sub-components were developed using Apache Ruta, a scripting language based rules engine. Rules were implemented to recognize mentions, abbreviations, punctuations and specific terms that imply age, gender, total cholesterol and HDL-C. For example, in a record with phrase ‘63 yo ’, the value 63 is extracted and implied as age based on abbreviation ‘yo’ which stands for ‘years old’. Rule-based FRS risk factor extraction component II and its sub-components were also based on Apache Ruta. This component extracts information regarding patient smoking history and BP values. A custom-built dictionary of smoking terms was used to identify smoking history. Similarly, to extract systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values pattern-matching rules were used. Post-processing involved filtering records based on rules. For example, rules were developed to remove records, which do not contain age and gender information. This component also assigns diabetes history for the patients in cohort. Since the corpus only includes those patients who are diagnosed with diabetes, the component assigned diabetes history as present for all patients. This component was also responsible to identify patients in the corpus eligible for the 10-year CAD FRS calculation. The output from this component are values for Framingham risk factors (age, gender, total cholesterol, HDL-C, BP, smoking history and diabetes history) in structured format.

The medical history of the patients from the corpus was spread out over different periods. Some patients had data recorded for all five encounters over just a single year, whereas some patients had data recorded over a span of 17years. However, the majority of the patients (over 90%) had medical history spread over a 5-year period. It was also noticed that each patient had only one EHR per encounter throughout the corpus. CAD FRS is applicable only to patients who have not been diagnosed with CAD at the time of risk score calculation [8]. Patient records, recorded after development of CAD or already diagnosed with CAD, were eliminated. Data from subsequent encounters after development of CAD were also deleted. This reduced the cohort from 296 to 192 patients. Another condition for FRS calculation is that the patient must be within the age of 30–74years old. Patients were removed who did not fall under this age group. This further reduced the cohort from 192 to 164 patients. The 164 patients were then categorized into two groups – group 1 and group 2. Group 1 included 78 patients who developed CAD over a period of time, while Group 2 included 86 patients who did not develop CAD according to available records (Fig. 3
                        ). The whole cohort selection process takes place in the post-processing component of the clinical text mining system.

Patient records belonging to the encounters where age is not within the range of 30–74years old were deleted. For example, if a patient with five records (from five encounters) had age recorded as 75years in third encounter, then records from encounter three, four and five were deleted. In other words, only risk factor information or values from encounter one and two were considered for the FRS calculation.

It was noticed that a number of risk factors had missing data, which was required to calculate CAD FRS from the final cohort. A systematic data quality assessment was carried out on the data extracted from the final cohort to understand missing data patterns. The assessment included calculating the percentage of missing risk factor data at the encounter level, categorized by group 1 and group 2. The most common way to handle missing data is to exclude or discard the data. However, discarding the data can create biased estimates and can significantly reduce the cohort size. Three imputation strategies were selected based on previous studies where a strategy has been effective in calculating the FRS [19–21]. Table 1
                         summarizes the imputation strategies employed based on the percentage of missing risk factor data. All three imputation strategies were applied at cohort level. A single imputation strategy for all missing variables might not be effective in situations where missing patterns vary. Thus, we employed three different imputation strategies based on the percentage of missing risk factor data to balance uncertainty in estimating FRS. Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 were applied when missing data is less than 10% because both strategies are single imputation methods and they ignore relationships between variables which is acceptable when minimal data is missing. Strategy 3 (multiple imputations) is employed where missing data is greater than 10%. Multiple imputations [22] involve creating multiple copies of dataset with imputed values. Each imputed copy is further analyzed using a standard method like regression or ANOVA. The resulting values from analyses are merged to obtain final values. The data quality assessment and imputation techniques were carried out using R statistical software.

A standalone java-based calculator was developed to calculate the 10-year CAD FRS using FRS risk factors – age, gender, SBP, DBP, smoking history, total cholesterol and HDL-C values. The calculator assigns points for each risk factor and calculates the final 10year CAD FRS from the total points [8]. CAD risk scores were calculated separately for men and women. The calculator assigns points based on the Framingham point table starting from age followed by other risk factors.

The imputed data from the data quality assessment and imputation step is programmatically passed to the calculator to obtain the 10-year CAD FRS for patients. As the corpus consists of temporal records for each patient, risk factor data required to calculate FRS is spread over multiple encounters for most patients. To address this issue, risk factor values across all encounters were carried forward. For example, if a patient is eligible for FRS calculation at his/her third encounter and HDL-C value is not available, then the HDL-C value recorded from his/her second encounter (if available) was used to calculate the FRS. However, if the HDL-C value was missing in all eligible encounter records, then the values were imputed based on the imputation strategies described above. Similarly, if a patient is a smoker at any given encounter he/she was considered a smoker for all encounters. FRS based on all the risk factors was calculated individually for each imputed dataset. Once the score was calculated for all the imputed datasets, the average of the scores across all the imputed datasets was computed to get the final FRS for a patient. Statistical analysis was carried out to compare the adjusted FRS means and medians for groups 1 and 2. Furthermore, the groups were also classified into three categories based on the final FRS scores. The 10-year CAD risk is considered low if the FRS is <10%, moderate if the FRS is in 10–20% range, and high if the FRS is >20% [23]. We also tested whether the patients who developed CAD over a period had higher FRS when compared to those who did not develop CAD. To validate, FRS for 20 patients were manually calculated using worksheets from the Framingham heart study [8]. All missing data in manual calculations were imputed using strategy 1.

@&#RESULTS@&#

A rule-based text mining system was developed to extract risk factors to calculate 10-year CAD FRS. The text mining system was able to process the EHRs from the corpus to extract risk factor data from the 164 patients included in the final cohort. Due to the lack of gold standard annotations for Framingham risk factors in the corpus, manual verification of the output from the system was necessary to verify the format, integrity and reliability of the risk factor data extracted. The output was generally reliable and the text mining system recognized most of the required risk factors correctly. However, the system failed to identify risk factor data in a few situations. The baseline characteristics of the two groups calculated using extracted risk factor data are presented in Table 2
                     .

Risk factor data is considered missing when risk factors did not have at least one value recorded or extracted throughout their medical history. The missing data may be due to two reasons: (1) the text mining system failed to recognize the risk factor data and (2) the risk factor data was not recorded. However, upon manual inspection of some EHRs and the output from the text mining system, it was observed that the majority of the missing data could be due to a second reason. The data quality assessment carried out to understand the missing data provided useful insights. The assessment results (Table 3
                        ) highlighted that a large number of patients did not have necessary risk factor data even when data from all encounters were considered. It was observed that out of all the risk factors considered in the study, HDL-C and total cholesterol had the most significant number of missing data. HDL-C was missing in 78.1% and total cholesterol in 73.8% of patients. There was no missing data for gender and diabetes because the cohort was all diabetic patients and the text mining system accurately identified gender of all patients. Using the imputation strategies listed in Table 1, HDL-C and total cholesterol values were imputed using multiple imputation techniques, whereas the mean value from the whole cohort was used to replace missing values for SBP and DBP.

The CAD risk scores generated using the proposed methods were consistent with the scores calculated manually for 20 patients using the official 10-year CAD FRS worksheet [8]. After imputations, the group that developed CAD and the group that did not develop CAD had an average 10-year FRS of 22% and 18%, respectively. When categorized based on FRS (Table 4
                        ), the moderate FRS category had a higher number of patients in both groups compared to the other categories. For the low FRS category, group 2 had 14 (16.3%) patients while group 1 had just 4 (5.1%) patients. Group 2 had a mean and median of 31% in the high FRS category, while group 1 had a 32% mean FRS and 28% median FRS. The average age is highest in the high FRS category, with 69.3years in group 1 and 71.1years in group 2.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The text mining system performance was reliable and consistent in extracting the risk factor data. However, we observed that, being a rule-based system, it failed in a few situations. Examples include:
                        
                           •
                           HCL was recorded instead of HDL-C.

Total cholesterol and HDL-C were reported as ratios in some records.

BP values were listed into two sections, ‘history of present illness’ as well as ‘physical examination’. Both of these sections were not always named as such, sometimes acronyms were used or sometimes section names were not mentioned at all.

In a few records, the risk factor values were mentioned without any label. For example, BP was just mentioned as 120/80.

Data was presented in varying tabular formats in a few records.

Some records simply summarized the values as ‘within normal limits’ or ‘vital signs normal’.

These situations made it difficult for the text mining system to extract the risk factor data [18,24]. However, these did not have much impact to the calculation of FRS; instead, missing data was the more challenging issue. On the other hand, the current text mining system can be extended to extract Framingham and non-Framingham risk factor data, which in turn can be used as features to develop models to predict CAD [34–36].

Whether the missing data is due to system failure to extract risk factor data or non-documentation, the missing risk factor data was imputed using three strategies. Imputations allowed patients with missing data to be included in the study. If the patients with missing data had been discarded, then only a fifth of the cohort would have been included in the study. The effects of imputations in FRS are also well documented in the literature. Previous studies have reported that imputing HDL-C values improved the reliability of the FRS that was calculated [12,20].

HDL-C and total cholesterol data was not mentioned at least once in over 75% of the patients in either groups. One possible rationale behind this is that HDL-C and total cholesterol are not routinely measured in clinical practice [12]. The lack of these test results is considered one of the barriers for using FRS calculation in a primary care setting [25,26]. An alternative for the total cholesterol to calculate CAD FRS is LDL-C. However, we noticed that LDL-C was missing at a much higher rate than total cholesterol in the corpus. This situation is common in studies using EHR data. Researchers do not have control over the data recorded in EHRs [27]. Another important trend to note is that patients in group 2 had more missing data than patients in group 1. This trend is commonly noted in routine clinical practice. Sick patients tend to have more encounters with clinician, thus creating more data [27,28].

According to the FRS calculated for both groups, over 40% of patients in the final cohort are at high risk of CAD and over 50% of the population fitted in the moderate FRS category. This result can be associated to the fact that all patients included in the cohort were already diagnosed with diabetes. In general, FRS underestimates the risk of CAD in the diabetic population [11,12,29,30]. This is because only 4% of the estimated diabetic population was represented in the original Framingham study. The information on the patients’ ethnicity was ignored in this study. However, a few studies have previously recommended modifications to the existing FRS to improve its accuracy [31]. Few studies report that FRS is more appropriate for healthy males within specific populations [19–21].

Several limitations were observed in this study; however, it is important to note that the main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using text mining to calculate FRS from unstructured EHRs. The main limitation is the lack of a systematic evaluation of the developed text mining system. The i2b2 track 2 corpus did not include all the risk factors required for CAD FRS calculation in gold standard annotations. Another limitation in this study is that the FRS was calculated using risk factor values that had been carried forward. By taking this approach, the temporal dimension of risk factors is completely ignored and this might have an impact on FRS, especially in patients with long medical history [28,32]. Clinical context is also another important limitation [33]. The calculated risk scores should be interpreted carefully. The methods presented in this study ignore clinical contexts. For example, two patients with similar FRS could be a result of completely different reasons like chronic kidney disease or chronic pulmonary disease [34]. A clinical contextual component to the existing text mining system might also improve its usability and its ability to be integrated into clinical decision support systems and EHR systems [31,37].

For the purpose of this study, it has been assumed that all risk factor data extracted are useful for calculating risk scores even though it has been established that the corpus used in this study was specifically gathered for identifying cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk factor data extracted are not necessarily the latest data reported. It is common for clinicians to order tests in one encounter and report results in the following encounter. Hence, an assumption was made that the data recorded in the encounter are from the most recent test that was performed.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Unstructured EHRs are possible sources for automatic assessment of patients’ risk for a disease. However, missing data is a challenge but can be handled by employing appropriate imputation methods. In this study, we presented methods to calculate the 10-year CAD risk scores from unstructured EHRs using a rule-based text mining system. The developed system was able to extract most of the recorded risk factor data. 10-year FRS was calculated for 164 eligible patients by mining over 500 unstructured EHRs. However, most of the patients did not have all the risk factor data necessary recorded in their medical history. The scores calculated using these methods were consistent with the scores that were calculated manually. The results showed that the majority of patients in this cohort had FRS between 10% and 20%, which may be associated to the fact that all the patients in the cohort were diabetic. We also demonstrated novel data usage of the corpus that was primarily built for other purposes. The methods presented are generic and useful for cohort discovery and risk stratification in studies where calculation of FRS is required from unstructured EHRs. Additionally, the current text mining system can be extended to extract non-Framingham risk factor data, useful in building models to predict CAD. In future, we would like to annotate the corpus with FRS risk factors and other relevant risk factors. This will allow evaluating the performance of text mining methods used. We also would like to compare scores for all patients calculated using our methods against the scores calculated by clinicians manually.
