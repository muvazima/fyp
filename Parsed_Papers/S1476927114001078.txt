                  Protein nitration is an important post-translational modification regulating protein structure and function, especially for heme proteins. Myoglobin (Mb) is an ideal protein model for investigating the structure and function relationship of heme proteins. With limited structural information available for nitrated heme proteins from experiments, we herein performed a molecular dynamics study of human Mb with successive nitration of Tyr103, Tyr146, Trp7 and Trp14. We made a detailed comparison of protein motions, intramolecular contacts and internal cavities of nitrated Mbs with that of native Mb. It showed that although nitration of both Tyr103 and Tyr146 slightly alters the local conformation of heme active site, further nitration of both Trp7 and Trp14 shifts helix A apart from the rest of protein, which results in altered internal cavities and forms a water channel, representing an initial stage of Mb unfolding. The computational study provides an insight into the nitration of heme proteins at an atomic level, which is valuable for understanding the structure and function relationship of heme proteins in non-native states by nitration.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Protein nitration is one of post-translational modifications (PTMs), which is derived from the reaction of Tyr/Trp residues in proteins, including heme proteins such as myoglobin (Mb) (Bourassa et al., 2001; Witting et al., 2001; Herold et al., 2003; Herold and Shicashankar, 2003; Herold, 2004; Nicolis et al., 2006; Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013), hemoglobin (Hb) (Xiang et al., 2013), cytochrome c (cyt c) (Batthyány et al., 2005; Rodríguez-Roldán et al., 2008; García-Heredia et al., 2010), and others (Smith et al., 1992; CrySavvides et al., 2002; Quint et al., 2006; Yamakura et al., 2003; Suzuki et al., 2004), with reactive nitrogen species (RNS), such as peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Compared to protein modifications by reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2
                     
                     −), less attention has been attracted to RNS (Yamakura and Ikeda, 2006). Meanwhile, RNS such as peroxynitrite can be formed by coupling of superoxide with nitric oxide radial (NO), an important signaling molecule in vivo (Darleyusmar et al., 1992). Peroxynitrite can also be generated in cells when exposure to radiation from X-rays as presented in our daily lives, such as computed tomography (CT) scans in hospital (Brenner and Hall, 2007). Increased levels of nitrated tyrosine were observed in the mouse hippocampus within two hours of radiation exposure (8Gy) compared to controls (Fukuda et al., 2004).

Moreover, protein nitration was found to occur in presence of nitrite (NO2
                     −) and H2O2, especially for heme proteins (Bourassa et al., 2001; Witting et al., 2001; Herold et al., 2003; Herold and Shicashankar, 2003; Herold, 2004; Nicolis et al., 2006; Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013; Xiang et al., 2013; Batthyány et al., 2005; Rodríguez-Roldán et al., 2008; García-Heredia et al., 2010). This is of biological relevance since bacteria on human tongue surface may reduce dietary nitrate (2–3mM daily) to nitrite (Lundberg et al., 2004), and H2O2 is a common ROS generated in vivo. Heme proteins play diverse functions in biological systems including oxygen delivery, electron transfer, catalysis and signaling, and their structure and function relationships are well-studied (Lu et al., 2003, 2009; Mayfield et al., 2011; Coelho et al., 2013; Spiro et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013, 2014; Lin and Wang, 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Poulos, 2014). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no 3D structural information available for nitrated heme proteins, although nitration of Mb has been observed as early as in 2001 (Bourassa et al., 2001). Crystal structures for other nitrated proteins are also limited (Smith et al., 1992; CrySavvides et al., 2002; Quint et al., 2006). This is likely due to the difficulty in purification of nitrated proteins from unmodified ones with slight structural differences. The structure and function relationship of nitrated heme proteins remains poorly understood. Recently, Iniesta and co-workers (Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013) selectively nitrated horse Mb at Tyr103 using an electrochemical approach and performed spectroscopic studies on not pure nitrated Mb, which provides some undirected structural information for nitrated Mb.

As a compliment, computational approach such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become a powerful tool to provide atomic level and time-dependent information for protein structure and function that otherwise is difficult to obtain from experiments (Karplus and McCammon, 2002; Daggett, 2006; Sotomayor and Schulten, 2007; Kandt and Monticelli, 2010; Lin, 2011; Lin and Liao, 2011; Lin et al., 2012a). Mb is an ideal protein model for investigating the structure and function relationship of heme proteins in both native and non-native states (Lu et al., 2003, 2009; Lin et al., 2013, 2014; Lin and Wang, 2013; Liu et al., 2014), and computer simulation plays a key role in guiding protein design and engineering based on Mb (Sigman et al., 2000; Yeung et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2012b). To provide structural insights into nitrated heme proteins, we herein performed MD simulation studies on human Mb with successive nitration of Tyr residues (Tyr103 and Tyr146) and Trp residues (Trp7 and Trp14), at 3- and 6-postions, i.e., 3-nitrotyrosine and 6-nitrotryptophan, respectively (Fig. 1
                     ), which are the major nitrated products based on experimental observations (Bourassa et al., 2001; Witting et al., 2001; Herold et al., 2003; Herold and Shicashankar, 2003; Herold, 2004; Nicolis et al., 2006; Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013; Xiang et al., 2013; Batthyány et al., 2005; Rodríguez-Roldán et al., 2008; García-Heredia et al., 2010).

@&#METHODS@&#

The initial structure of human Mb was taken from the X-ray structure of its double mutant, K45R/C110A Mb (PDB entry 3RGK (Hubbard et al., 1990)), since no structure of wild-type protein was available yet. Topology files for 3-nitrotyrosine (NIY) and 6-nitrotryptophan (NIW) were created according to report by Myung and Han (Myung and Han, 2010). Based on the accessibility of Tyr and Trp residues by nitration in Mb (Bourassa et al., 2001; Witting et al., 2001; Herold et al., 2003; Herold and Shicashankar, 2003; Herold, 2004; Nicolis et al., 2006; Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013), the initial structures of Mb with successive nitration of Tyr103, Tyr103/Tyr146, Tyr103/Tyr146/Trp7 and Tyr103/Tyr146/Trp7/Trp14, termed NIY1-Mb, NIY2-Mb, NIY2/NIW1-Mb and NIY2/NIW2-Mb, respectively, were generated with program VMD 1.9 (Visual Molecular Dynamics) (Humphrey et al., 1996). The psfgen plug-in was used to add hydrogen atoms and assign charges to nitrated Mbs according to pH 7.0. Both heme distal His64 and proximal His93 were modeled with hydrogen at the δ-position, and other histidines in Mb were protonated at the ϵ-nitrogen, i.e., HSD and HSE in topology file, respectively. The protein was then solvated in a cubic box of TIP3 water, which extended 10Å away from any given protein atom. Counter ions (Na+ and Cl−) were further added to the nitrated Mb–water systems to obtain the physiological ionic strength of 0.15M by using the autoionize plug-in of VMD 1.9.

The resultant system was first minimized for 50,000 steps with conjugate gradient method, and subsequently equilibrated for 100,000ps, then further minimized for 10,000 steps. The resultant configuration was subjected to MD simulation with program NAMD 2.7 (Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics) (Kalé et al., 1999) at 300K for 20ns by employing the classical force filed CHARMM27 (MacKerell et al., 1998). The force field parameters of 3-nitrotyrosine and 6-nitrotryptophan were developed by Myung and Han (Myung and Han, 2010). The Langevin dynamics was used for constant temperature control, with a value of the Langevin coupling coefficient setting to 5ps. The simulations were performed with an integration time step of 1fs. Atom-based cutoff of 14Å with switching at 12Å was used for non-bonded van der Waals interactions. The trajectory data was saved every 5000 steps (corresponding to 5ps), generating 4000 structures over 20ns of simulation for analysis. Control MD simulation was performed for native Mb under the same conditions.

Visualization and data analysis, including backbone C
                     α root mean square deviation (RMSD), residue RMSD and accessible surface area (Å2), were done with VMD 1.9. Average structure of nitrated Mb was obtained from the last 5ns simulation, which was further submitted to CASTp (Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins) server (http://cast.engr.uic.edu) (Dundas et al., 2006) to identify internal cavities with a default probe radius of 1.4Å. The protein pocket was visualized by program PyMOL 0.99rc6 (DeLano, 2002).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In order to measure the conformational stability of Mb as a result of successive nitration of Tyr103, Tyr146, Trp7 and Trp14, we monitored the backbone C
                        α RMSD for NIY1-Mb, NIY2-Mb, NIY2/NIW1-Mb and NIY2/NIW2-Mb during 20ns MD simulations. As shown in Fig. 2
                        (A), NIY1-Mb and NIY2-Mb had a RMSD profile fluctuating around 1.1Å and 1.5Å, respectively, after 10ns, which is slightly different from that observed for Mb (around 1.3Å), indicating that slight conformational alteration was major induced by nitration of Tyr146 instead of Tyr103. With further nitration of Trp7, NIY2/NIW1-Mb exhibited slightly larger RMSD values than that for NIY2-Mb after 7ns. Moreover, with both Tyr and Trp nitrated, NIY2/NIW2-Mb Trp7/Trp14 exhibited a much larger deviation around 2.5Å after 12ns. These observations suggest that nitration of Trp especially for Trp14, in the hydrophobic core of Mb alters the protein conformation dramatically.

Furthermore, an average RMSD over time of each residue provides more detailed motions for these nitrated Mbs. As illustrated in Fig. 2(B), the eight α-helices in human Mb have small deviations around 1Å, which agrees well with previous MD studies on sperm whale Mb (Lin et al., 2012a). At the same time, both NIY1-Mb and NIY2-Mb had a similar profile to that of Mb, except for several residues at C-terminus of NIY2-Mb where Tyr146 was nitrated. This observation suggests that nitrated Tyr146, NIY-146, causes larger local conformational changes compared to NIY-103 that locates in helix G. For NIY2/NIW1-Mb and NIY2/NIW2-Mb, similar large RMSD deviations were observed for the C-terminal residues. Meanwhile, most residues at N-terminus in helix A (residues 3–18) of NIY2/NIW2-Mb were found to have large RMSD values (around 3Å), suggesting that nitration of both Trp7 and Trp14 causes a movement of helix A apart from the rest of protein. At the same time, large RMSD deviations (4–7Å) were also observed for the loop of helix E and F (residues 75–83) in both NIY2/NIW1-Mb and NIY2/NIW2-Mb, which is close to Trp7 in space and thus can be attributed to the effect of nitration.

We also monitored the change in accessible surface area of Mbs during simulations. It showed that the accessible surface area of both NIY1-Mb and NIY2-Mb was similar to that of Mb, whereas it was slightly greater for both NIY2/NIW1-Mb and NIY2/NIW2-Mb, especially for NIY2/NIW2-Mb (Fig. 2(C)). The average accessible surface area of NIY2/NIW2-Mb after 5ns was calculated to be ∼2.15×104
                        Å2, which is ∼5% greater than that of Mb (∼2.05×104
                        Å2). The increase of accessible surface area can be attributed to the movement of helix A as a result of nitrification of Trp7/Trp14, which was further confirmed by polypeptide alignment of nitrated Mbs with native Mb. As shown in Fig. 3
                        , the average structure of NIY2/NIW2-Mb in the last 5ns simulation overlapped well with that of Mb, whereas a large shift was observed for the helix A, as well as the loop of helices E and F. Comparatively, with nitrification of Trp7, NIY2/NIW1-Mb exhibited only a moderate shift at the N-terminus.

To further probe structural consequences of Tyr/Trp nitration in Mb, we analyzed the intramolecular contacts in the average structure of NIY1-Mb, NIY2-Mb, NIY2/NIW1-Mb and NIY2/NIW2-Mb, respectively. It showed that the nitro group of nitrated Tyr103 in both NIY1-Mb and NIY2-Mb formed a hydrogen bond with the NH2 group of Lys42 (2.82Å and 2.77Å, respectively, Fig. 4
                        (A and B), similar to the interaction with the guanidino group of Arg in the crystal structure of nitrated glutathione reductase (PDB entry 1K4Q) (CrySavvides et al., 2002). The crystal structure of K45R/C110A Mb showed that Lys42 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carboxyl group of Lys98 in the loop of H and G (2.86Å). These two different hydrogen bonding interactions may contribute similarly to protein stability by stabilizing the conformation of helix C.

On the other hand, the nitro group of nitrated Tyr146 in NIY2-Mb formed a weak hydrogen bond with the backbone amino group of Val101 (3.62Å) (Fig. 4(B)), which is more exposure to solvent with respect to Tyr146 in Mb. Instead, the crystal structure showed the hydroxyl group of Tyr146 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carboxyl group of Ile99 (2.72Å) (Hubbard et al., 1990). These observations indicate that nitration of Tyr103 or both Tyr103 and Tyr146 induces slight local conformational changes, and leaves the heme active site with similar conformation to that of Mb. Note that although the distance between distal His64 (Nϵ atom) and heme iron in NIY1-Mb (4.75Å) and NIY2-Mb (4.81Å) was slightly increased compared to that in the crystal structure (4.47Å), similar distance (4.84Å) was observed for Mb in control simulation, suggesting not being an effect of nitration. Previous NMR study also showed that nitrated horse Mb at Tyr103 has a very similar tertiary structure to that of native Mb, with the same UV–visible spectral features (Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013).

With further nitration of Trp7 or both Trp7 and Trp14, the micro-environment of the nitrated Trp residue was very different for NIY2/NIW1-Mb and NIY2/NIW2-Mb, although they had a similar heme active site to that of NIY1-Mb and NIY2-Mb. As shown in Fig. 4(C), the nitrated Trp7 in NIY2/NIW1-Mb was found to interact with Lys79 in loop of helices E and F by hydrogen bonding interaction (2.86Å), as well as with local water molecules. On the other hand, the nitrated Trp7 and Trp14 in NIY2/NIW2-Mb were found to interact with their surrounding water molecules, and a water channel was formed among helices A, E and H (Fig. 4(D)). As a result, the hydrophobic interactions within the region of Trp7 and Trp14 were disrupted, which will decrease the protein stability. Previous study has been shown that Trp7 and Trp14 play a key role in Mb folding, and substitution with Phe such as W7F/W14F mutation leads to rapidly aggregation of the apoprotein under physiological conditions (Ianuzzi et al., 2013). Therefore, the exposure of helix A to solvent in NIY2/NIW2-Mb by nitration of Trp7/Trp14 may represent an initial state of unfolding with an increased assessable surface area.

The presence and function of internal cavities in Mb have attracted much attention in recent ten years (Bossa et al., 2005; Cohen et al., 2006; Anselmi et al., 2008; Ruscio et al., 2008; Ceccarelli et al., 2008; Maragliano et al., 2010; Tomita et al., 2010). Tilton et al. first observed four cavities occupied by Xenon (Xe) atoms (Xe1–4) in the crystal structure of sperm whale Mb (Tilton et al., 1984), which was further confirmed by Savino et al. (PDB entry 2W6W (Savino et al., 2009)). In previous simulation study, we compared the internal cavities of sperm whale Mb and Aplysia limacina Mb that lacks the conserved distal His64 (Lin et al., 2012a). For human Mb, there was no crystal structure available for the wild-type protein, and MD simulation was applied to study its structure and function (Gussoni et al., 2011; Scorciapino et al., 2013). To provide cavity information for human Mb as well as the consequences of nitration, we analyzed the cavities based on present simulations.

As shown in Fig. 5
                        (A), four major cavities were identified in the average structure of human Mb from the last 5ns simulation. The one above heme group is the well-known heme distal pocket (DP) (Scorciapino et al., 2013); the one on the heme side (C1) is corresponding to the Xe1 and Xe2 sites in the crystal structure of sperm whale Mb (Savino et al., 2009), and the other two cavities (C2 and C3) are corresponding to the Xe3 and Xe4 sites, respectively. With nitration at Tyr103 in NIY1-Mb, it showed that DP and cavities C1–C3 remained similar positions (Fig. 5(B)) as that in native Mb. Meanwhile, with further nitration at Tyr146, cavity C2 moved toward C3 in NIY2-Mb (Fig. 5(C)). This is because the end part of helix G and the region of helices A and B in NIY2-Mb were packed more closely than that in Mb (Fig. 3). In NIY2/NIW1-Mb (Fig. 5(D)), although DP and cavity 1 remained similar as that in Mb, the volume of cavity C3 was increased from ∼104Å3 of Mb to ∼205Å3. In NIY2/NIW2-Mb (Fig. 5(E)), it showed that a huge water channel with a volume of ∼894Å3 was formed by cavities C2 and C3 with a result of shift of helix A, which is likely due to a synergic effect on the conformational changes by nitration at both Trp7 and Trp14. Since the cavities in Mb are closely related to ligand binding kinetics and migration pathways, the differences between Mb and nitrated Mb may account for its O2 binding and delivery as well as other functions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

With limited structural information available for nitrated heme proteins, we performed a MD simulation study and investigated the structural consequences of successive nitration of human Mb at Tyr103/Tyr146 close to the heme active site and Trp7/Trp14 remote from the heme active site. It showed that nitration of Tyr103/Tyr146 slightly alters local conformation and leaves the heme active site largely intact, in agreement with experimental observations (Nicolis et al., 2006; Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013). Meanwhile, nitration of Trp7/Trp14 shifts helix A apart from the rest of protein, resulting in forming a water channel, which represents an initial stage of Mb unfolding. The simulation study also revealed that nitration regulates the distribution and formation of internal cavities that are closely linked to ligand binding and migration inside Mb. This study thus provides valuable information of nitration at an atomic level for heme proteins, and also for understanding their structure and function relationship in non-native states by nitration.
