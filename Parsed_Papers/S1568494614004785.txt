               Abstract
               
                  Robots with vastly different capabilities and specifications are available for a wide range of applications. Selection of a robot for a specific application has become more complicated due to increase in the complexity, advanced features and facilities that are continuously being incorporated into the robots by different manufacturers. The aim of this paper is to present an integrated approach for the optimal selection of robots by considering both objective and subjective criteria. The approach utilizes Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM), Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP), Fuzzy modified TOPSIS or Fuzzy VIKOR and Brown–Gibson model for robot selection. FDM is used to select the list of important objective and subjective criteria based on the decision makers’ opinion. Fuzzy AHP method is then used to find out the weight of each criterion (both objective and subjective). Fuzzy modified TOPSIS or Fuzzy VIKOR method is then used to rank the alternatives based on objective and subjective factors. The rankings obtained are used to calculate the robot selection index based on Brown–Gibson model. The proposed methodology is illustrated with a case study related to selection of robot for teaching purpose. It is found that the highest ranked alternative based on Fuzzy VIKOR is closest to the ideal solution.
