                  Objective
                  To study the effects of wearing extravehicular activity (EVA) gloves on grip strength and fatigue in low temperature, low pressure and mixing of two factors (low temperature and low pressure).
               
               
                  Methods
                  The maximum grip strength and fatigue tests were performed with 10 healthy male subjects wearing gloves in a variety of simulated environments. The data was analysed using the normalization method.
               
               
                  Results
                  The results showed that wearing gloves significantly affected the maximum grip strength and fatigue. Pressure (29.6, 39.2 kPa) had more influence on the maximum grip compared with control group while low temperatures (−50, −90, −110 °C) had no influence on grip but affected fatigue dramatically. The results also showed that the maximum grip strength and fatigue were influenced significantly in a compound environment.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Space environment remarkably reduced strength and endurance of the astronauts. However, the effects brought by the compound environment cannot be understood as the superimposition of low temperature and pressure effects.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Strength is the source of manual performance, and under the control of the brain it can realise precise manual performance by contraction force from the upper body and muscles of various hands parts. Up to 90% of actions in extravehicular activity (EVA) are performed by the upper body (Zhang et al., 2011). However, astronaut operation strength during extravehicular activity decreased dramatically due to the combined effect of glove pressure, low temperature and glove structure (Ding et al., 2005). Therefore, in the development process of EVA gloves, the major problem is how to maintain necessary strength during extravehicular activity. Endurance and strength are always considered together in the experiments because enough physical strength is the premise to complete the work. A reduction in strength and fatigue will lead to additional energy expenditure and fatigue, and a result could be a serious accident.

Scholars have studied various elements affecting hand strength from different perspectives. Geng researched the influence of low temperature on performance from aspects of subjective feelings and finger temperature measurements when in touch with low-temperature objects (Geng et al., 2001); Aldien illustrated the pressure distribution of the hand-handle operation interface by studying hand forces and handle size (Aldien et al., 2005). As far as the study of an EVA glove is concerned, Buhman showed the influence of the glove on maximum grip strength from glove structure, pressure, load, handle structure (Buhman et al., 2000). However, they only conducted single-factor analysis of each element, and the influence of low temperatures was not included. Tsaousidis studied the effects of gloves on maximum force and the rate of force development in pinch, wrist flexion and grip (Tsaousidis and Freivalds, 1998). By low-pressure chamber experiments, Bishu established the maximum limits of strength and fatigue when performing all kinds of tasks with gloves, which was manifest in the relationship between strength and fatigue (Bishu et al., 1995). Francisco studied the relationship between strength and dexterity by dynamic pinch performance (Valero-Cuevas et al., 2003). However, these studies mainly focused on single-factor effects on strength. There has been no definite conclusion on the interaction (addition, subtraction or combination) of glove pressure, low temperature and glove structure on strength, which is the real condition of EVA.

Therefore, this article studies hand strength under the combined influence of glove strength and low temperature and takes maximum grip strength and grip fatigue as essential evaluating indicators.

Ten male volunteers from university joined this experiment. The length of their hands was 18 ± 0.3 cm. The width of hands was 10.5 ± 0.2 cm. They were all right-handed and volunteered to participate in the experiment.

We used a replica of an EVA glove from the Astronaut Centre of China to conduct the tests. It had two parts: pressure glove and TMG. During the EVA, it was a part of the spacesuit. The pressure inside the clothing was constant. The pressure between the inside and outside of the glove was 29.6 (US)/39.2 (Russia) kPa. The test on the ground could simulate pressure differential only because of gravity. However, the state of the glove was similar. For specific content, refer to section 2.5 and Fig. 1
                        .

The experiment included three variables: pressure, ambient temperature (AT), and grip bar surface temperature. Therefore, the experiment had five groups (Table 1
                        ). The first one was the control group, where the environment and grip bar temperature were 25 °C, and pressure was 0. This group was mainly used for comparison with other data. Group Ⅰ simulated different pressures (22.1/29.6/39.2 kPa) (Ding et al., 2005), but the other variables were the same. These pressures were standard stamping data for EVA gloves. The variables in Group Ⅱ were the same as the control group, except the grip bar surface temperature (−50/−90/−110/−130 °C). We designed this group because grasping low temperature objects was a common action in EVA activities. According to the literature, the surface temperature of objects in space is between −50 and −130 °C (Zhang et al., 2011). Group Ⅲ simulated a compound environment in which the pressure and the temperature changed. The pressure was 39.2 kPa, grip bar surface temperature was −50/−110/−130 °C, and the other variable was the same as the control group. We determined this pressure because this study mainly focused on the Chinese EVA glove. In Group Ⅱ, we found that there was no significant difference between −50 and −90 °C, so we ignored −90 °C in Group Ⅲ. In order to simulate an environment closer to the real EVA, we designed Group Ⅳ to compare with the Group Ⅲ data. In Group Ⅳ, the EVA gloves would be put in a −50 °C environment. The pressure was 39.2 kPa, and the grip bar temperature was −50 °C. At this point, heat loss occurred at both the palm side and back side of the glove, and the surface temperature of the hand fell even faster.

According to the ways of force imposed by hands in manual work, hand strength can be divided into grip, pinch and twist. Grip strength is caused by bending all the fingers together except the thumb. Pinch results from squeezing between fingertips. Different from grip and pinch, a twist completes work by the resulting moment and is relevant to the friction coefficient of the object surface. This article chose maximum grip strength as the object of study because strength studies of EVA gloves were often based on hand-handle interface with grip strength as the main method. Moreover, according to Chen's research (Chen et al., 2006), a correlation did exist among grip, pinch and twist, thus grip could be used in tests in place of the other two forces.

Muscle fatigue may occur after long-time exertion of force, and in turn it will affect normal operation. Fatigue has a direct relationship with operation strength and time, namely work power. Because a comparatively large number of muscles is involved in gripping, fatigue appears more quickly and obviously, especially in extravehicular activities (Ding et al., 2009). That is why grip strength was chosen in the fatigue test. On the basis of the previous studies in this laboratory, dynamic grip and static grip were combined in this experiment.

Experiments were conducted in a low-temperature simulation cabin designed for EVA gloves (Fig. 1), which was composed of a grip measurement system, temperature measurement system, refrigerating (cooling) system and pressure system.

The grip acquisition system includes low-temperature dynamometer, data measurement card (Kangsente，XST/A-H1MT0B3S1N) and self-developed grip acquisition system based on a monitor and control generated system (MCGS). Its functions include acquiring, real-time displaying and recording grip strength values. The dynamometer was composed of measurement lever and low-temperature lever. The former was an elastomer fixed with pressure sensors, and the grip strength was converted by the elastic deformation and measured by sensors. The latter was a hollow metal circular cylinder. Liquid nitrogen could be injected from one end to make the temperature reach the ideal value in the experiment. When using the dynamometer, subjects touched the surface of the low-temperature lever with their fingers and pressed the dynamometer with their palms to generate grip strength data. The working theories behind grip measurement system were that when the dynamometer is grasped, pressure signals are received by pressure sensors and transformed into voltage signals, then acquired through data measurement card and stored in the Excel worksheets by running the MCGS grip measurement system. The test precision was 0.1 kg.

The temperature measurement system included a resistance temperature sensor (PT-100), digital meter and temperature data measurement system based on Kingview platform. The system was designed to collect, real-time monitor and record the temperature change of dynamometer surface, environment and fingers. The principle of operation was that temperature signals from various temperature-measuring points were transformed into resistance values by temperature sensors, and then transmitted to a digital meter, which could transform those values into digital signals. The test precision was 0.1 °C.

The cooling system was composed of a Dewar bottle, heat installation, cabin and low-temperature dynamometer. It was designed to reach various low temperatures required by dynamometer or low-temperature cabin. The way of controlling the temperature was to let liquid nitrogen flow out of the Dewar bottle and flowed into heat installation, inside which it gasified into low-temperature nitrogen. The low-temperature nitrogen finally flowed into the dynamometer and low-temperature cabin. The principle is similar to a radiator. The temperature of the dynamometer was controlled by adjusting the volume of gasified nitrogen through a valve, while the temperature in low-temperature cabin was controlled by the volume of liquid nitrogen flow directly. Temperature precision of the dynamometer was 2 °C, and test cabin was 1 °C.

The pressure system included a vacuum pump, vacuum gauge, low-temperature cabin and simulated EVA glove. The system was designed to achieve pressure difference between inside and outside of the gloves by drawing off air in a low-temperature cabin using a vacuum pump. The operational principle of this system was that the low-temperature cabin was a sealed hollow metal cylinder when the door of the cabin was closed. The glove was fixed on the cabin door, with the external surface contacting the environment in the low-temperature cabin, and the interior surface was exposed to the atmosphere. Drawing off air in the low-temperature cabin with the vacuum pump, pressure was monitored by a vacuum gauge. The interior of the glove was connected with the outside atmosphere, so the pressure difference was the difference between atmospheric pressure and pressure inside the cabin. When astronauts performed with pressured EVA costumes in space, the environment was considered as a vacuum, and the pressure difference was the air pressure of costumes. The relative pressures of gloves under the above two circumstances could be regarded as the same. Pressure-controlling precision was 10 Pa.

Before the experiment, a low-temperature cabin was cooled and the air was drawn off to make cabin and gloves meet the designing demands of the test group. Subjects were asked to put their hand into the glove with temperature sensors attached inside to conduct a grasping test. When performing experiments, the subjects were seated on a bench with appropriate height, thus avoiding the influences of push or pull brought by the centre of mass moving forward or backward. The position of the dynamometer could be adjusted by preference of the subjects to help them exert maximum grip strength. The procedures were as follows:
                           
                              (1)
                              Grip strength. Subjects were asked to grip the dynamometer using their maximum strength for three times every 3 min. Then the averaged value was taken as the subjects' maximum grip strength (F
                                 
                                    max
                                 ).

Grip fatigue. Subjects grasped the dynamometer uniformly with the frequency of 5 times/30 s exerting their maximum strength, and then performed a static grip, during which subjects were required to grasp the dynamometer for 10 s with 30% of maximum grip strength (F
                                 
                                    max
                                 ). This process was repeated until at least two out of five times of grip values were below the 50% of F
                                 
                                    max., or any fingertip temperature monitored was below 8 °C in dynamic grip. For each test, only one condition was involved; a three-day rest was given in between two tests in order to let the subjects recover from the fatigue.

Each volunteer would do the grip strength first, then take a 10 min break. Once it was confirmed that the volunteer had recovered, the grip fatigue test could begin. According to the different physical ability of subjects, the fatigue test would last 15–40 min.

Concerning the fact that there was no common evaluating standard for the identification of grip fatigue of EVA gloves, this article improved the processing methods of fatigue on the basis of existed research (Ding et al., 2005, 2009), using the work generated during the process of grasp as an evaluation index. Fig. 2
                         shows the real-time curve of grip strength. Acquisition frequency was 5 times/s. Compared with the change of grip strength, the acquisition cycle of 0.2 s was short enough to ensure that the force of sensors within each cycle was constant. Thus, it was natural to consider d that the strain S of the dynamometer within each acquisition cycle was constant.

Eq. (3) manifested that the amount of work done was relevant to the strain rate of foil gage (e) in the dynamometer and grip values collected in the grip measurement system. In order to eliminate the influence of e, this article used the method of dividing experimental data by control data to eliminate e, thus, work was only related with grip value.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the comparison of fatigue processing methods. Fatigue was calculated by impulse method and work method, respectively, and then normalised. Compared with subjective votes of the subjects, it was found that the work method was more preferable.

@&#RESULTS@&#

According to the results of our first treatment condition that is illustrated in Fig. 4
                           , glove pressure is shown to have considerable effects on the maximum grip strength. Specifically, among the three pressurised conditions in treatment group I, the exposure to 22.1 kPa had little effect on the reduction of maximum grip force (p > 0.05). Increasing the pressure to conditions of 29.6 kPa and 39.2 kPa showed significant effects (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences among the three pressurised conditions of group I (p > 0.05).

Treatment group II, illustrated below in Fig. 5
                           , showed that grasping low-temperature objects slightly reduces the maximum grip strength. To clarify, the low-temperature condition itself had an indistinct effect on the maximum grip strength (p > 0.05), and there were no obvious differences in terms of grip force among the four low temperatures (p > 0.05). Compared to the control group, finger temperature in treatment group II reduced dramatically (p < 0.05, Fig. 6
                           ). However, there were no significant reductions in finger temperatures at −90 °C, −110 °C, and −130 °C (p > 0.05).

According to Fig. 7
                           , the combined conditions of low temperature and increased pressure reduced the maximum grip strength dramatically (p < 0.01). However, there were no differences among three conditions of treatment group III (p > 0.05).

By comparing the selected data with the condition of −50 °C bar temperature from each experiment, we discovered that the maximum grip strength did not change significantly. Although the grip force might be reduced below 20 kg under conditions of high pressure and low temperature, this would readily enable astronauts to accomplish most EVA tasks on extravehicular missions.

According to the comparison of 1 and 2 in Fig. 8
                           , pressure had a profound effect on maximum grip strength. Further analysis of 2 and 3 indicated that the maximum grip strength would not decline as long as the pressure was constant, even if the environmental temperature was lower than average conditions. Therefore, in terms of maximum grip strength, the major influential factor was the pressure inside the glove, and the effect of combined factors was no greater than that of any single factor.

According to Fig. 9
                           , the addition of pressure had an evident effect on grip fatigue (p < 0.01). Compared to the working capacity in control group, the capacity declined in each condition of the treatment group I, ranging from 23 to 37%. However, there were no distinct differences between the three conditions (p > 0.05).


                           Fig. 10
                            revealed that grasping low-temperature objects affected grip fatigue significantly (p < 0.01). Compared to the working capacity of the control group, the capacity of the treatment group II was reduced 50% approximately on average, but there were no significant differences among four temperatures, −50 °C, −90 °C, −110 °C, and −130 °C (p > 0.05).

By comparing the dynamic grip strength at the end, the dynamic grip strength was determined to be no less than half of the maximum grip strength under the condition of −110 °C and −130 °C, which allowed volunteers to keep grasping. However, the finger temperature had already reached the study termination criteria (8 °C, Fig. 11
                           ), thus the trial was terminated and volunteers were unable to continue testing. In contrast, under the condition of −50 °C and −90 °C, the finger temperature had not reached the cessation criteria, while the end grip strength was comparatively low. This allowed us to conclude that trial volunteers ended the experiment due to the hand fatigue.

According to Fig. 12
                           , the working capacity of hands was reduced below 40% of that in the control group under the combined condition of pressure and low temperature. This condition allowed hand fatigue to occur easily. However, there were no obvious differences among three conditions of the treatment group (p > 0.05).

Interestingly, by comparing the selected data with −50 °C bar temperature (Fig. 13
                           ), a totally different conclusion was drawn. Comparing 1 and 2, we found that pressure had an imperceptible effect on working capacity, while comparing 2 and 3, environmental temperature had an extreme effect on working capacity of hands.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

R. Bishu mentioned in his NASA report that when a certain type of EVA glove pressurised to 29.5 kPa, the maximum grip strength would reduce to around 14 kg; when unpressurised, around 22 kg; and when pressurised, more than 29.5 kg, no obvious additional reduction (Bishu and Glenn, 1995). Even though there were numerical value differences, the general tendency of the report's result was consistent with that of our study, which illustrated that pressure indeed had an effect on grip strength. The major cause of the grip strength decline was the inner and outer pressure difference of the glove, which put the glove in a state of expansion. Due to the expansion, the glove folds would generate resistance, which opposed the working direction of the glove, and counteracted partial grip strength, resulting in a declining grip. Moreover, Fig. 4 shows that the mean of maximum grip has a slight decline, with the pressure increase, yet it is non-significant. The reasons may be: (a) expansion of the glove has small differences between the different pressures, which means the reaction between the lever and the fingers changed little; (b) the value of resistance is far less than the grip strength; it would be covered by the strength differences of volunteers; (c) the musculoskeletal system has not changed in grip strength with different pressures. Therefore, there were no obvious differences among diverse pressure levels, which was consistent with O'Hara's study result (O'Hara et al., 1988).

The result of the temperature-grip force experiment indicated that the finger skin temperature dropped greatly, but within a short time, temperature would not cause the grip strength to decline dramatically. Because the maximum grip strength was estimated within a short period, the finger skin temperature did not decline under 8 °C, even though the temperature was −130 °C. Because human tissue is good conductor of heat, and the circulation of the blood balances the body temperature, even if the surface temperature is low, the core temperature in muscle tissue will not fall. This is better to ensure the activity of muscle tissue. Furthermore, study volunteers did not report painful levels of coldness, and their finger temperature could recover quickly. Hence, the interference of low temperatures on grip force was less than that of pressure. Although there is no literature regarding this field, according to Qiuqing Geng's study (Geng et al., 2001), finger temperature would drop below 10 °C three to 5 min after the finger touched low-temperature objects, which might cause numbness and/or piercing pain of the extremities (initial temperature was 20 °C). In this experiment, our study volunteers actually spent much less time touching the grip bar than that in the literature, while the glove had a certain isolation, which was sufficient to maintain the temperature of the fingers. Therefore, the results of grip strength were credible.

Hand tolerance to fatigue has an obvious decreasing trend as the pressure increased, which was identical to O'Hara and Bishu's test results (O'Hara et al., 1988; Bishu and Glenn, 1995). The reasons may be: (a) glove resistance always exists in the tests; (b) muscles could not get sufficient rest, and maximum grip strength falls faster than a no-pressure state. Compared with the maximum grip strength, the gap between pressure and non-pressure becomes greater. Yet, for different pressure, the difference is not obvious, because the situation of force is basically identical.

The tolerance to fatigue was severely affected by temperature, but the successive decline of the temperature did not cause significant change of working capacity. Due to the particularity of the fatigue evaluation method, experiment II was divided into two situations. (a) When the temperature was very low (−110, −130 °C), heat would be lost to the environment due to the difference in temperature during the prolonged fatigue tests. The heat of the fingers, produced in blood and tissues, was unable to compensate the loss of heat in the environment, and the finger temperature was significantly reduced. As a result of this reduction in finger temperature, tingling, stiffness and other stress reactions were produced. These results led to a great decrease of working time, which affected the number of cycle (n) of fatigue evaluation and resulted in a decrease of working amount. (b) In another low temperatures (−50, −90 °C), the human body's metabolic heat could still remain at the finger temperature, so the experiment did not reach the termination conditions for low finger temperature. In this case, the evaluation of the impact of the fatigue was mainly responsible for the reduction of the grip force, which was similar to the pressurised condition. Thus, the experiment revealed that when the low temperature reached a certain value, the defined loss of astronauts' working ability would depend on both the low temperature or muscle fatigue, depending on the circumstances of the experiments.

Based on the results of horizontal comparison, we discovered that pressure was the dominant influential factor on the maximum grip strength, while the temperature had a slight effect. This paper argues that because the time period of the maximum grip strength test was too short, the finger temperature did not reduce to a defined level of intolerance, and thus, would not affect finger activities. Therefore, the contact of hand and glove due to the glove stamping was the main reason of the decline of the grip force.

Additionally, this paper argues that, for a long period of extravehicular activity, certain thermal protective concern of the palm side of the hand may be appropriate, which helps to improve the comfort of the palm to maintain the grip ability of hand. However, reducing the pressure inside the glove and improving joint structure are the main methods to solve the grip problem.

The circumstance of combined pressure and low temperature has obvious effects on fatigue. Data showed that grip was basically reduced 60–70%, and it even reduced to about 25% in experiment IV, which showed that when astronauts were doing extravehicular tasks, the main problem was the decline of tolerance capacity. From the statistical analysis of EVA tasks, we found that more than 10 cases of extravehicular tasks explicitly mentioned cold extremities, numb, and fatigue. For example, on 25 June 25 1993, at the 110th World Extravehicular Activities, the astronauts from the US were forced to suspend the extravehicular activity, because their hands were cold, numb and painful (Zhang et al., 2011). We could be sure that the astronaut's body quality was very good, because they had already undergone strict training on the ground before the task. But the low temperature in space was still beyond their expectations. We are curious about what kind of roles the low temperature had. The horizontal contrast of the results indicated that when the ambient temperature is lower than 110 °C the effect of temperature on working capacity is more obvious than that of pressure, which seriously affected the assessment of fatigue. Especially in the experiment IV, when the back side hand temperature decreased, the amount of working capacity reduced by half of the control provided by experiment II. The reason for this situation might be due to loss of heat from the back side of the hand, which resulted in an expedited decrease of fingertip temperature. This would cause earlier termination of the experiment, and would further reduce the number of working cycles. Therefore, for long-period extravehicular missions, in addition to emphasis insulation of the palm side of the hand, targeted thermal protection of the back-side of the hand is also necessary to effectively enhance astronauts' working duration and efficiency.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

From the system study of maximum grip strength and grip fatigue of EVA gloves under combined factors (low-temperature, pressurised condition), the following points provide a summary:
                        
                           (1)
                           The major effect of the maximum grip strength was the pressurised state of the glove, while temperature had a lesser effect;

Low temperature and pressure might affect the working capacity of the astronauts. However, pressure mainly caused fatigue, while temperature mainly affected the working time;

Thermal protective performance of the back-side of hand had a key role enhancing astronauts' working time and their tolerance capacity.
