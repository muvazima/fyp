                  We provide a new reduction-based approach for proving the NP-hardness of optimization problems and establish that it includes the “classical” approach as a special case. We apply our alternative approach to prove the NP-hardness of a problem for which the classical approach is not applicable. Besides, we construct a special case of the problem with the property that finding an optimal element takes polynomial time despite that computing the objective function values is NP-hard.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

We consider a general combinatorial optimization problem Popt
                      in the following setting, which is consistent with the definitions given in standard texts such as Garey and Johnson (1979), Papadimitriou and Steiglitz (1982), Papadimitriou (1995), and Schrijver (2003). We confine our consideration to minimization problems although all the results are also valid for maximization problems.


                     Given a set DP of problem instances, a finite set X(I) of feasible elements for each I ∈ DP, and a real-valued objective function F(I, x), x ∈ X(I). The aim is to find x
                     * ∈ X(I) such that
                     
                        
                           F
                           (
                           I
                           ,
                           
                              x
                              *
                           
                           )
                           
                           =
                        
                      
                     min{F(I, x)|x ∈ X(I)} for the given instance I ∈ DP if X(I) ≠ ∅ or report that
                     
                        
                           X
                           (
                           I
                           )
                           =
                           ∅
                        
                     
                     .
                  

The elements x
                     * are called the optimal elements.

Hereinafter, x
                     * means either arg 
                     min{F(I, x)|x ∈ X(I)} if X(I) ≠ ∅ or 
                        
                           X
                           (
                           I
                           )
                           =
                           ∅
                        
                     .

Following the conventional notion (see, e.g., Garey & Johnson, 1979), we say that problem Popt
                      is NP-hard if there is a Turing reduction from any problem in NP to Popt
                     .

Consider the following problem associated with Popt
                     :

Standard Decision Problem

Instance: I ∈ DP
                      and a number y.

Output: “yes” if there is an x
                     0 ∈ X(I) such that F(I, x
                     0) ≤ y; “no” otherwise.

In particular, if 
                        
                           X
                           (
                           I
                           )
                           =
                           ∅
                           ,
                        
                      then the output is “no”.

To show the NP-hardness of an optimization problem using the “classical” approach, one constructs a Standard Decision Problem that corresponds to the original problem Popt
                      and proves the NP-hardness of the former problem. We refer to this procedure as the standard scheme for proving the NP-hardness of an optimization problem.

Since x
                     0 ∈ X(I) such that F(I, x
                     0) ≤ y exists if and only if F(I, x
                     *) ≤ y, the validity of the standard scheme is based on the following Turing reduction of the Standard Decision Problem to the optimization problem.

                        
                           Step (a).
                           Solve the optimization problem Popt
                              .

Given x
                              * (found in Step (a)), calculate F(I, x
                              *) (if X(I) ≠ ∅).

Compare F(I, x
                              *) and number y. Return “yes” if F(I, x
                              *) ≤ y; otherwise (if F(I, x
                              *) > y or if 
                                 
                                    X
                                    (
                                    I
                                    )
                                    =
                                    ∅
                                 
                              ), return “no”.

If both Step (a) and Step (b) can be executed in polynomial time, then the Standard Decision Problem is polynomially solvable. If the Standard Decision Problem is proved to be NP-hard and Step (b) can be executed in polynomial time, then Step (a) cannot be executed in polynomial time (unless 
                        
                           P
                           =
                           N
                           P
                        
                     ). The latter fact allows us to conclude that the optimization problem is NP-hard. On the other hand, if we have no polynomial algorithms to implement Step (b), then we can say nothing about the NP-hardness of problem Popt
                     .

Thus, the standard scheme works correctly if and only if Step (b) can be executed in time polynomial of the input size of problem Popt
                     .

Following Garey and Johnson (1979), we denote by Length[I] the length of a reasonable encoding of instance I.

By and large, the standard scheme works quite well. However, it cannot cope with some odd cases where, e.g., given x
                     * ∈ X(I) for Popt
                      problem, the value of F(I, x
                     *) cannot be computed in time polynomial of Length[I].

It may be argued that such odd cases need no additional research because the NP-hardness of computing F(I, x
                     *) implies the NP-hardness of searching for x
                     *. To counter this argument, we present a polynomially solvable optimization problem with an objective function that cannot be calculated in polynomial time if P ≠ NP. To construct an example of such a problem, we formulate a scheduling problem involving parallel machines and jobs with start-time and position dependent processing times.

It seems that some researchers bear in mind the standard scheme in defining special classes of optimization problems. Vazirani (2001, Appendix A) considers a class of NP-optimization problems consisting of all the optimization problems with polynomially computable objective functions. The same restriction is used by Ausiello, Crescenzi, Gambosi, Kann, Marchetti-Spaccamela, and Protasi (1999, Chapter 1) to define a class NPO of so-called constructive problems.

We do not confine our discussion to problems with polynomially computable objective functions. So the problems under consideration are in general outside the class NPO and they are not NP-optimization problems.

To outline the basic idea of our approach for proving the NP-harness of optimization problems, we first analyze the standard scheme from the following point of view. The Standard Decision Problem is formulated in such a way that it has answer “yes” if and only if F(I, x
                     *) ≤ y for a given number y. If we have the optimal element x
                     *, then we can easily check whether F(I, x
                     *) ≤ y holds (if F(I, x
                     *) is easily computable). On the other hand, if we do not have x
                     *, then the Standard Decision Problem should be NP-hard, which implies the NP-hardness of the corresponding optimization problem.

We develop our approach for analyzing problems with hard computable objective functions. This means that we should avoid the calculation of the objective function values in our process of proving NP-hardness. In the standard scheme, they use a property of the problem instance I to provide the correctness of the inequality F(I, x
                     *) ≤ y. The particular instance I may have this property (then the answer is “yes” for the Standard Decision Problem) or it may not have the property (then the answer is “no”). Note that the checking of the property for I should be done without knowing the element x
                     * for instance I.

The idea of our approach is to replace the property based on the inequality F(I, x
                     *) ≤ y with a different property that does not involve the calculation of the objective function values. The new property should possess two features. It should be easily checkable if we are given an optimal element x
                     * and its checking should be an NP-hard problem if we have instance I and do not have x
                     *. Then the NP-hardness of the optimization problem will follow immediately from an argument similar to that used in case of the standard scheme.

The idea looks quite simple and almost evident upon its discovery. As with any discovery, the most challenging aspect is to stumble upon an innovative insight into a problem, which may take a long time to emerge.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a short review of some related results. In Section 3 we formulate our alternative approach to proving the NP-hardness of optimization problems and show that the classical approach is a special case of it. In Section 4 we consider a scheduling problem with start-time and position dependent processing times of jobs (Problem 1) and propose a simple but non-polynomial algorithm to solve it. In Section 5 we show that the objective function values of Problem 1 cannot be computed in polynomial time if P ≠ NP. Besides, we construct a polynomially solvable special case of Problem 1 with the same property of having a hard computable objective function. We use the alternative approach to show the NP-hardness of Problem 1 in Section 6.

In the literature, there are different techniques for proving the NP-hardness of optimization problems. It appears that the first attempt to provide a general technique was presented by Garey and Johnson (1979, Section 3.2).

Subsequent results concern some specific classes of problems. For example, Creignou (1995) proposes a technique for proving the NP-hardness of a number of graph theory problems, which are shown to be linearly equivalent to the known satisfiability problem.


                     Kovalyov and Pesch (2010) provide a unified approach for proving the NP-hardness of unconstrained partition-type problems (partitioning a given set of elements into several subsets such that a certain objective function of the partition is optimized).


                     Sevastianov (2005) develops a so-called multi-parameter complexity analysis of a discrete problem. The proposed technique aims to establish the complexity of some subproblems of a discrete problem (decision or optimization) by analyzing possible combinations of constraints on the key parameters of the problem.

The mentioned approaches either work with decision problems or (in case of optimization problems) are based on the standard scheme.

As noted in the previous section, to illustrate the proposed alternative approach for proving the NP-hardness of optimization problems, we formulate a scheduling problem (Problem 1) involving parallel machines and jobs whose processing times are variables that depend on the start-times of the jobs and on the positions of the jobs in the sequence on a particular machine. The mentioned Problem 1 relates to the so-called high multiplicity problems. We discuss this type of problems in Section 4.3, where we give additional references.

Scheduling research in which the processing times of the jobs depend on their start times was initiated by Melnikov and Shafransky (1980), who considered two-machine flow shop and single-machine problems to minimize the makespan. Many papers have since been published presenting results on scheduling problems with jobs whose processing times depend on their starting times (see the reviews by Alidaee and Womer (1999), and Cheng, Ding, and Lin (2004) for details). A comprehensive review of the problems with start-time dependent processing times can be found in the book by Gawiejnowicz (2008).

Some papers present results that unite the technique for proving NP-hardness of optimization problems and scheduling research with jobs having start-time dependent processing times. Ng, Barketau, Cheng, and Kovalyov (2010) establish the strong NP-hardness of the Product Partition problem (which differs from the well-known Partition problem by considering the product of item weights instead of their sum). As an offshoot, the NP-hardness of some scheduling problems with start-time dependent processing times is established. Gawiejnowicz, Kurc, and Pankowska (2009) introduced a general transformation of scheduling problems with parallel machines and start-time dependent processing times. The transformation gives rise to the definition of a class of equivalent problems (a schedule is optimal for the initial problem if and only if the schedule constructed by this transformation is optimal for the resulting problem). Obviously, if the initial problem is NP-hard, then the transformed problem is NP-hard as well.

There are a number of papers studying scheduling problems in which the processing time of a job depends on its position in the processing sequence. In fact, such a dependence may be considered as a dependence on the state of the machine, since the position of a job indicates the number of jobs that the machine has processed before it. It appears that Gawiejnowicz (1996) was the first to pursue research in this direction. Among pioneers in this stream of research are Biskup (1999), and Cheng and Wang (2000).

Both types of scheduling problems (with start-dependent and position-dependent processing times) are reviewed by Biskup (2008), and Janiak and Kovalyov (2006). Some recent results are presented by Hsu and Yang (2014), Jiang, Chen, and Kang (2013), Qian and Steiner (2013), Wang and Wang (2014), and Zhao, Yin, Cheng, and Wu (2014), amongst many others. The most recent review of the results for problems with start-dependent and position-dependent processing times is given in book by Agnetis, Billaut, Gawiejnowicz, Pacciarelli, and Soukhal (2014, Chapter 6).

We consider a general optimization problem Popt
                      such that the values of its objective function F(I, x) cannot be calculated in polynomial time (unless 
                        
                           P
                           =
                           N
                           P
                        
                     ). For such a problem, the standard scheme for proving its NP-hardness cannot be used. This situation calls for the development of a new scheme for proving the NP-hardness of optimization problems. One of the main features that the new scheme should possess is that it gives a possibility to avoid calculating the objective function values.

For an instance I of problem Popt
                     , denote by X
                     *(I) the set of all the optimal elements x
                     * for I.

Recall that, from a mathematical point of view, the phrase “a property” means a unary relation, i.e., it is a set. Saying that an object has a property, we mean that the object belongs to a set that defines the property.

For a particular instance I ∈ DP
                      and any property Π
                     * ⊂ DP
                     , we mean that I ∉ Π
                     * if 
                        
                           X
                           (
                           I
                           )
                           =
                           ∅
                        
                     .

                        Lemma 1
                        
                           An optimization problem Popt is NP-hard if there exist a polynomial p and a property Π
                           * ⊂ DP that satisfy the following conditions:
                           
                              
                                 10.
                                 
                                    Given an instance I of problem Popt, recognizing whether I ∈ Π
                                    * 
                                    is an NP-hard problem.
                                 


                                    Given any optimal element x
                                    * ∈ X
                                    *(I) for an instance I of problem Popt, recognizing whether I ∈ Π
                                    * 
                                    is solvable in time p(Length[I]).
                                 

Denote by Z the decision problem from condition 10. Suppose that we have an algorithm Aopt
                            for solving problem Popt
                           . Using algorithm Aopt
                           , we can find an optimal element x
                           * ∈ X
                           *(I) for any instance I of Popt
                           .

In view of condition 20, problem Z may be solved in time p(Length[I]) given any optimal element x
                           * for I; denote the corresponding algorithm by AR
                           . Since the time complexity of AR
                            is bounded by p(Length[I]) and x
                           * and Π
                           * are parts of algorithm AR
                            input, the lengths of their descriptions should be bounded by some polynomial in Length[I]. Construct an algorithm AZ
                            for solving problem Z as a composite of algorithms Aopt
                            and AR
                            (algorithm Aopt
                            finds x
                           *, then algorithm AR
                            recognizes whether I ∈ Π
                           * holds). The time complexity of AZ

                           . This means that algorithm AZ
                            defines a Turing reduction from the NP-hard problem Z to the optimization problem Popt
                           . In particular, if Aopt
                            is a polynomial algorithm, then Z is a polynomially solvable problem. Thus, Popt
                            is an NP-hard problem.□


                     Lemma 1 provides a basis for formulating an alternative scheme for proving the NP-hardness of optimization problems.

To prove the NP-hardness of Popt
                     , it suffices to construct a special case of problem Popt
                      with some property Π
                     * that satisfies conditions 10 and 20.

The NP-hardness of recognizing the validity of the inclusion I ∈ Π
                     * without the benefit of a known x
                     * ∈ X
                     *(I) may be established through a polynomial reduction of some known NP-hard problem. To prove the validity of condition 20, one should use some specific properties of the constructed special case of problem Popt
                     .

There is a clear relationship between the standard scheme that is based on the classical approach and the alternative approach that we have just presented.

                        Lemma 2
                        
                           The standard scheme for proving the NP-hardness of optimization problems is a special case of the alternative scheme.
                        

As mentioned above, the standard scheme works correctly if and only if the value of F(I, x
                           *) for given x
                           * ∈ X
                           *(I) can be calculated in time polynomial of Length[I] for instance I of problem Popt
                           .

Define property Π
                           * in the following way: 
                              
                                 
                                    Π

                                 =

                                    I

                                    ≤
                                    y
                                    ,
                                    
                                    
                                       x
                                       *
                                    
                                    ∈
                                    
                                       X
                                       *
                                    
                                    
                                       (
                                       I
                                       )
                                    
                                    }
                                 
                              
                           . If F(I, x
                           *) is polynomially computable, then the alternative scheme becomes the standard one under such definition of Π
                           *. In fact, x
                           0 ∈ X(I) such that F(I, x
                           0) ≤ y exists if and only if x
                           * ∈ X
                           *(I) satisfies the condition F(I, x
                           *) ≤ y. This means that the proof of the NP-hardness of problem Z is equivalent to the proof of the NP-hardness of recognizing the existence of element x
                           0.

In addition, the inequality F(I, x
                           *) ≤ y holds and does not hold for all x
                           * ∈ X
                           *(I) simultaneously. Therefore, the checking of the validity of the inclusion I ∈ Π
                           * reduces to the checking of the validity of the inequality F(I, x
                           *) ≤ y. According to the condition 20, the complexity of the mentioned checking should be bounded by a polynomial p(Length[I]) if we are given x
                           * ∈ X
                           *(I). This implies that the value F(I, x
                           *) should be polynomially computable.□

Next we present a problem with a hard computable objective function.

We consider a multi-machine processing system where the processing time of job j on machine H depends on the starting time of processing job j and on the state of the machine at that time.

We consider a processing system consisting of M unrelated parallel machines. Each of the n identical non-preemptive jobs may be completely processed on any of the machines. It is supposed that the state of each machine H depends on the number of jobs that have been processed on the machine by the current time. For each machine H, there is a given cost WH
                         > 0, being the cost of processing a job for one time unit on this machine. The goal is to construct a schedule s to process the n jobs in the described machine environment such that the total cost F(s) of processing all the jobs is minimized.

The processing time pH
                        (k, t) of job j on machine H depends on the position k of job j in the corresponding sequence and on its starting time t (recall that all the jobs are identical). The value of pH
                        (k, t) is given by the relation

Since φ
                           H
                        (k) > 0 for any k, an idle time on a machine before processing any job assigned to the machine increases the processing times of the jobs that follow the idle period. This leads to the unreasonable growth of F(s) value. So we consider schedules without the mentioned idle times.

All the jobs are identical, so any schedule s without idle times is defined by the set of numbers

The setting of Problem 1 is motivated by the following real-life situation. In electro-chemical treating of parts, the composition of the electrolyte used for the treatment changes over time (its concentration decreases). For the scheduling aims, the producer needs to take into account the changing conditions of the treatment (the processing time of a job (a part) increases with the growth of the number of jobs that have been processed earlier on the machine). Besides, there is a stage of preliminary processing of the parts that can process practically an unbounded number of parts simultaneously. If a preprocessed part waits for the main treatment, its properties acquired during the preliminary stage deteriorate over time, which results in an increase in the time needed for the treatment of the part at the main stage. This increase may be modeled by making the processing time of a job dependent on the instant at which the job begins processing in the main stage.

In short, we present the formulated problem in the following form.

                               that minimizes the total processing cost F(s).

We assume that the functions λH
                        (k) and φ
                           H
                        (k) are presented in formulas and that each of these formulas may be described in a polynomial space with respect to M and log n (e.g., using LaTeX encoding for formulas). This assumption is very weak since usually the description of a formula needs a constant number of symbols. Besides, we assume that the complexity of calculating the values of the functions is bounded by some polynomial p
                        1 in M and log n. We assume also that each WH
                         is bounded by M
                        
                           q(M) for some polynomial q.

To describe any instance of Problem 1, it suffices to present M functions of λH
                        (k) and M functions of φ
                           H
                        (k), as well as M numbers of WH
                         and number n.

The above assumptions allow us to conclude that the length of the input of Problem 1 is bounded by C × M × p(M, log n) for some polynomial p and constant C.

We propose a simple greedy algorithm to solve Problem 1. The algorithm assigns the next job to the machine on which the processing cost of the job is minimum.

Let nH
                         be the current number of jobs assigned to machine H. Then the processing cost of the next job assigned to machine H equals

                                 p
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 (

                              .
                           
                         We look through all the machines, find one where the cost is minimum, and assign a job to this machine. The process is completed when all the jobs are assigned to the machines.

It is easy to check that the running time of Algorithm A is O(n × p
                        1(M, log n)). Recall that p
                        1(M, log n) is a polynomial that bounds the time complexity of calculating the values of the functions λH
                        (k) and φ
                           H
                        (k). Therefore, Algorithm A is not a polynomial algorithm since the length of the problem input is C × M × p(M, log n).

The presented estimation of the running time of Algorithm A establishes the validity of the following statement.

                           Note 1
                           
                              Problem 1 is a pseudo-polynomially solvable problem.

If Algorithm A with such a low time complexity is a non-polynomial algorithm, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Problem 1 has no polynomial-time algorithm at all (if P ≠ NP). Yet in trying to prove the NP-hardness of Problem 1, we found it impossible to use the standard scheme since the computation of F(s
                        *) is not polynomial if P ≠ NP (see Theorem 2 in Section 5 below).


                        Problem 1 is a typical example of the so-called high multiplicity (HM) problem, where there are large groups of identical input elements (see Hochbaum and Shamir (1990) and Hochbaum and Shamir (1991) for details, in which the notion of high multiplicity is first explicitly introduced but no formal definition of HM problems is given). A formal definition of HM scheduling problem is given by Brauner, Crama, Grigoriev, and van De Klundert (2007): a scheduling problem is an HM problem if the number of jobs n is not polynomially bounded in the input size of the problem.

Comprehensive reviews of results on the HM scheduling problems are provided by Clifford and Posner (2001), and Brauner et al. (2007).

To create a concise encoding for a high multiplicity problem, we cannot give a description of each of the identical elements. Instead, we should describe a representative of each group of identical elements and provide the capacity of the group in the encoding string. For Problem 1, there is only one such group, i.e., the set of jobs.

Since in Problem 1 we are dealing with functions λH
                        (k) and φ
                           H
                        (k) that are in a relatively general form, we should provide an encoding scheme to describe them. As mentioned in Section 4, we suppose that each of the formulas that present functions λH
                        (k) or φ
                           H
                        (k) may be described in a polynomial space with respect to M and log n (e.g., using LaTeX encoding for formulas).

For HM scheduling problems, one important issue about the construction of polynomial-time algorithms is to come up with a compact presentation of a schedule. Some basic ideas of such a presentation are given by Hochbaum and Shamir (1991), Brucker, Kovalyov, Shafransky, and Werner (1998), Clifford and Posner (2000), 2001), and Filippi and Romanin-Jacur (2009). The essence of the ideas is conventionally presented in two approaches. The first approach is to construct an optimal schedule in which each set of identical jobs is partitioned into a relatively small (polynomial in the problem size) number of groups and within each of these groups the jobs are processed sequentially. Such a schedule may then be presented in a compact form since for each of the found groups of jobs it suffices to state the particular machine on which the jobs should be processed, the starting time of the group, and the number of identical jobs in the group. The second approach is to construct an optimal schedule that has a regular structure. The compact presentation (by a set of formulas and relations) of such a schedule is captured by the regular structure. The two approaches are often combined. It should be noted that the second approach is also useful when we deal with problems (not necessarily HM problems) with unit-time operations or with preemptions. The number of unit-time operations may not be polynomial in problem size, which makes it impossible to present an operation-by-operation schedule in polynomial time without additional research. Finding an optimal schedule that has a regular structure may lead to the possibility of converting a non-polynomial algorithm into a polynomial one (see, e.g., the peculiar method proposed by Timkovsky (2001) for the two-machine job-shop problem

                         with unit-time operations to minimize the maximum lateness).

Sometimes one is unable to propose a compact presentation of a solution for an HM problem or there is a need to present a solution in some prescribed form that is not polynomial in the size of the problem instance. In such cases, an algorithm that generates a solution cannot be considered as polynomial. Nevertheless, it is possible to devise an algorithm that is polynomial in the length of the solution encoding. Some approaches in this field are presented by Brauner, Crama, Grigoriev, and van De Klundert (2005) and Brauner et al. (2007).

In case of Problem 1, we have a relatively simple situation with respect to the compact presentation of a schedule. The first approach works quite well here. As mentioned at the beginning of this section, to define a schedule for Problem 1, it suffices to give the numbers of jobs assigned to the machines.

Our next goal is to show that computing the F(s) values is an NP-hard problem. First, we consider a special polynomially solvable case of Problem 1.

In Problem 2 we have two functions instead of 2M functions in the input of Problem 1. Nevertheless, the input length of Problem 2 is almost the same: it is bounded by some polynomial in M and log n.

Without loss of generality, we suppose that W
                           1 ≤ W
                           2 ≤ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ WM
                            (otherwise, we re-number the machines). For a positive number K, denote by ⌊K⌋ the largest integer D not greater than K.

Since the constructed instance LD is an instance of Problem 2, the following proposition holds:

                           Corollary 2
                           
                              Calculating the objective function values of Problem

                              cannot be performed in polynomial time (if P ≠ NP). On the other hand, it follows from Lemma 
                              
                                 3
                               
                              that the construction of an optimal schedule for any instance of Problem 
                              
                                 2
                               
                              takes O(Mlog M) time, i.e., it takes polynomial time.
                           

We use the alternative scheme to show that Problem 1 is NP-hard.

Problem Partition has a solution if and only if the optimal schedule s
                           * for the constructed instance of Problem 1R satisfies the condition n
                           1(s
                           *) > n
                           2(s
                           *). Indeed, the existence of a solution for Partition is equivalent to the existence of an index r such that

                            At the same time, it follows from Lemma 4 that the relation n
                           1(s
                           *) > n
                           2(s
                           *) holds if and only if there exists r such that

                                    )

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The main result of the paper is the alternative approach to proving the NP-hardness of optimization problems. The alternative approach includes the “classical” approach as a special case.

While the alternative approach is especially useful for proving the NP-hardness of optimization problems with a hard computable objective function, it can be used for problems with a polynomially computable objective function as well.

We give an example of a scheduling problem (Problem 2) where the identification of an optimal element for any instance of the problem takes polynomial time, while the calculation of the objective function values is an NP-hard problem. The example shows that there is no direct relationship between the hard computability of the objective function and the NP-hardness of an optimization problem Popt
                     .

For future research, it is worth developing a similar approach for proving the strong NP-hardness of optimization problems.
