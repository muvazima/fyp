                  Protein phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation are reciprocally regulated. As hyperphosphorylation is implicated in tau pathology, approaches have been exploited to reduce the magnitude of tau phosphorylation by increasing the level of tau O-GlcNAcylation. With mathematic models constructed to describe different kinetic scenarios, we analyzed the temporal change of an O-GlcNAcylated protein in contrast to that of the phosphorylated form upon inhibition of O-GlcNAcase (OGA). The analyses indicate that when degradation of the modified protein is negligible relative to the naked one, the magnitude of O-GlcNAcylated protein increase is proportional to the level of inhibition, while the extent of phosphorylated protein decline varies due to other factors. Furthermore, the increase of O-GlcNAcylated protein parallels with the decrease of phosphorylated form upon acute or short-term inhibition of OGA, as observed in many in vitro and short term in vivo studies. However, phosphorylated protein is predicted to return to its initial level while O-GlcNAcylated protein to achieve a higher steady level under sustained inhibition. This simulated result is in line with a recent report on long-term inhibition of OGA in transgenic mice. Noticeably, inhibition withdrawal is anticipated to cause a transient rise of phosphorylated protein. If degradation of modified proteins proceeds in addition to the naked one, the characteristic temporal profiles of each form in response to OGA inhibition would depend on the relative importance of individual degradation pathways. The models described herein may serve as a useful investigational tool that will provide insight into pharmacological intervention for tauopathies in particular and for reciprocally modulated reactions in general.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

O-GlcNAcylation is a common posttranslational modification of cellular proteins by β-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). It refers to the enzymatic transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc donor to the hydroxyl group of serine/threonine residues of proteins via an O-glycosidic bond (Hart, 1997). This process is catalyzed by O-linked N-acetylglucosaminetransferase (O-GlcNAc transferase, OGT). O-GlcNAc on proteins can also be removed with the catalysis by β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase, OGA). These two enzymes dynamically regulate protein O-GlcNAcylation in response to cellular signals or cellular stages. The dynamic modification occurs many times during the lifespan of the polypeptide backbone (Zachara and Hart, 2006; Chou et al., 1992; Roquemore et al., 1996), analogous to protein phosphorylation (Varedi et al., 2010).

It has been recently observed that O-GlcNAcylation appears to occur on most serine and threonine residues that would otherwise be phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases. In some proteins, O-GlcNAcylation occurs on the adjacent serine or threonine residues that are known to be phosphorylated. Therefore, these two reactions competitively modify the same serine/threonine residues, or exclude the counterpart by prior occupancy of the adjacent serine/threonine residues (Zeidan and Hart, 2010; Comer and Hart, 2001; Kamemura et al., 2002). This competition is reflected by the extensive interplay of these two reactions (Hart et al., 2011). For instance, many proteins are reciprocally modified under different conditions at the same site by either O-GlcNAc or phosphate (Comer and Hart, 2001; Chou et al., 1995; Cheng and Hart, 2001; Du et al., 2001), and other proteins are competitively modified at proximal sites but not at the same residue (Slawson et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2006; Dias et al., 2009). Of particular importance is the implication of this reciprocity in the modification of the microtubule-associated protein tau due to the possible link of hyperphosphorylation of the protein to the etiology of tauopathies, mostly represented by Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Tau protein plays an important role in stabilizing microtubules of neurons under normal physiological conditions (Avila et al., 2004). However, in certain pathological situations, it aggregates into paired helical filaments (PHFs) that, in turn, spontaneously assemble to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (Braak et al., 1986). These NFTs are one of the defining pathological hallmarks of AD and of the wider group of neurodegenerative disorders known collectively as the tauopathies (Lee et al., 2001). Several lines of evidence indicate that hyperphosphorylation attributes to tau aggregation. It has been found that NFTs are mainly composed of insoluble Tau that is hyperphosphorylated on many serine or threonine residues (Lim and Lu, 2005). The number of phosphate groups per tau was reported to increase from 2 or 3 in healthy brain tissue to about 8 in the brains of AD patients (Ksiezak-Reding et al., 1992). It is believed that in addition to promoting self aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation impairs binding of tau to microtubules and results in decreased microtubule stability (Lindwall and Cole, 1984). In light of these findings, pharmacological intervention of tau phosphorylation has attracted extensive attention and efforts (Boutajangout et al., 2011). However, direct manipulation of phosphorylation is very challenging as this process is regulated by numerous serine/threonine kinases and phosphatases (Boutajangout et al., 2011; Manning et al., 2002). In contrast, O-GlcNAc modification is regulated by only two carbohydrate-processing enzymes (Hart et al., 2007), although both exist in more than one isoform, which may provide some degree of substrate specificity (Hanover et al., 2003). In this regard, the apparent reciprocal relationship between protein phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation has stimulated considerable efforts to reduce the level of phosphorylated tau through elevating the O-GlcNAc form (Boutajangout et al., 2011). One appealing approach is to inhibit OGA with selective small molecules (Macauley and Vocadlo, 2010).

This chemical intervention has brought about the expected outcomes described in several reports. A potent, selective OGA inhibitor thiamet G elevated O-GlcNAc levels of global and tau proteins in cell cultures in a concentration-dependent manner. Thiamet G elicited similar results in rats (Yuzwa et al., 2008) and in JNPL3 tau transgenic mice (Yuzwa et al., 2012) following acute or short-term treatment. However, its effect on phosphorylation diminished after long-term treatment regardless of the sustained elevation of O-GlcNAc that was accompanied with reduced rates of neurodegeneration and tau aggregation in the same transgenic mice (Yuzwa et al., 2012). This contradictory effect on phosphorylation prompted us to understand how the dynamics of these reciprocally related reactions would influence the temporal response to reducing O-GlcNAc removal rate. With a mathematical model constructed to describe the reciprocity of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation, we analyzed the temporal change of an O-GlcNAcylated protein in contrast to that of the phosphorylated form upon inhibition of OGA in different kinetic scenarios. The analyses characterized the key determinants of temporal profiles of these two modified proteins in response to OGA inhibition and provided mechanistic insight into the observations.

@&#METHODS@&#

Disposition of a protein that is modified by two reciprocally regulated reactions can be described by a general model as depicted in Fig. 1
                        . In this model (Model 2), a zero-order rate K
                        in defines the synthesis of the unmodified protein (P1) which is either degraded by a pathway defined by a first-order rate constant K
                        out1 or modified to form P2 and P3. The modified products (P2 and P3) can return to P1 upon removal of the modification. Assuming the modification and reversal operate in a first-order fashion, the steps can be then described by respective rate constants K
                        12, K
                        13, K
                        21 and K
                        31, respectively. If P2 and P3 undergo degradation (or any route of clearance), the processes can be defined by first-order rate constants K
                        out2 and K
                        out3 accordingly. If protein breakdown only happens to P1, the whole dynamics can be simplified to Model 1 where P2 and P3 serve as a depot at equilibrium with P1. To put the model in context by using tau protein disposition as an example, P1, P2 and P3 represent naked, O-GlcNAcylated and phosphorylated tau, respectively. K
                        12 and K
                        21 are the first-order rate constants for reactions catalyzed by OGT and OGA, while K
                        13 and K
                        31 for reactions by a kinase and phosphatase. K
                        out1, K
                        out2 and K
                        out3 define the turnover of P1, P2 and P3, respectively.

We first deal with a situation where degradation of P1 is the only turnover route (Model 1). In this case, the dynamics of P1, P2 and P3 can be described by following differential equations.

The pharmacokinetic parameters of an OGA inhibitor were fixed with k
                        el, V

                        tp being 0.1 (h−1), 5 (L), 1 (h−1) and 1 (h−1). Other parameters that varied in simulations include those defining the dynamics of naked and modified proteins, i.e. system parameters (Table 2
                        ). As well recognized, one of the most difficult tasks among all steps of constructing mathematical models for biological systems is the estimation of system parameters (Chou and Voit, 2009). The case of tau protein modification is not an exception. Little is known about the in vivo dynamics of the naked and modified forms. Nevertheless some information can be inferred from the fact that addition and removal of phosphate and O-GlcNAc can occur multiple times during the lifetime of a protein (Zachara and Hart, 2006; Chou et al., 1992; Roquemore et al., 1996). Therefore, K

                        31 for the conversion between naked and modified proteins were set greater than K
                        out values in general unless the significance of P3 proportion in the response to OGA inhibition was evaluated. As the value of each system parameter is arbitrary, the response of individual forms to the inhibition of OGA is expressed as the fold of change relative to the baseline level. The symbols and definitions of parameters and variables are presented in Table 1
                        . For simplicity, all simulations were conducted with intravenous infusion with the infusion rate being varied to achieve desired systemic inhibitor concentration based on its IC50 value (0.5–3-fold IC50). In addition, OGA inhibition was generalized as reducing K
                        21.

All simulations presented in this manuscript were performed using Berkeley Madonna™ (version 8.3.18, Berkeley, CA).

@&#RESULTS@&#

In cases where only P1 (unmodified protein) undergoes degradation (Model 1), infusion of the inhibitor to the concentration of IC50 results in two-fold increase of P2. This magnitude of P2 elevation is independent of the dynamics and baseline level of any form of the protein, as shown in Fig. 2A. However, the time taken to reach the new steady state varies, depending both on the direction and on the rate of a given pathway. In Fig. 2A, curve A serves as the reference where K
                        12, K
                        21, K
                        13 and K
                        31 are set at 3 (h−1) and K
                        out1 0.01 (h−1). In simulations for curves B–E, the rate constants K
                        12, K
                        13 and K
                        31 are 10-fold lower (0.3h−1) and K
                        out1 10-fold higher (0.1h−1), respectively. P2 reaches the new steady state faster when K
                        out1 is higher (Curve E) or K
                        12 is lower (Curve B). In contrast, K
                        13 does not seem to have significant impact on the time-course of P2 (Curve D), while the impact of K
                        31 appears to be biphasic: P2 elevates faster first and then slowly climbs to the new steady state (Curve C).

As expected for any reciprocally related reactions, lowering K
                        21 causes P3 to decline as delineated in Fig. 2B. Unlike P2, the magnitude of reduction varies, depending on the system turnover rate (K
                        out1) and the relative portion of P2 and P3 in the whole pool. The magnitude decreases as K
                        out1 increases (Curve E), presumably due to more P1 being degraded and thus leaving fewer to form P3. As a result, P3 becomes less sensitive to the changes in the counterpart reaction. At the same K
                        out1, varying the respective rate constants changes the relative amount of modified protein forms at steady state. According to Eqs. (5) and (6), the ratio of the rate constants defining the forward and reverse reactions determines the baseline level of P2 or P3. With K
                        in and K
                        out1 being constant, a greater ratio means a faster forward reaction than the reverse one, and consequently a higher baseline of a given product (P2 or P3 in this case). Accordingly, smaller K
                        12 and K
                        31 imply a greater fraction of P3 relative to P2 and thus makes P3 less responsive to the increase of P2 (Curves B and C). On the contrary, a smaller K
                        13 makes P3 more sensitive to the rise of P2 (Curve D) because P3 accounts for less relative to P2 in this case. Noticeably, no matter how much P3 drops, it bounces back to the baseline if the inhibition of K
                        21 continues. The rate of P3 return mirrors that of P2 arriving at the new steady state. The opposite changes in respective rate constants expectedly bring about opposite responses of P2 or P3 (data not shown).

The magnitude of K
                        21 inhibition significantly shapes the turnover of P2 and P3, as reflected by the different length of time taken to reach the new steady state in Fig. 3
                        . This figure illustrates the time-courses of P2 (Fig. 3A) and P3 (Fig. 3B) changes at different C
                        ss levels. It takes approximately 1000, 2000 and 7000h for P2 to arrive at the new baseline levels and for P3 to bounce back to the original baseline when C
                        ss equals to 0.5, 1- and 3-fold of IC50. It can be envisioned that when K21 becomes smaller with a greater degree of inhibition, the system will take longer to reach a new equilibrium. Noticeably, the new baseline of P2 is proportional to the C
                        ss, while it is true only with the effect area under the curve (AUEC) for P3 (data not shown), not its maximal drop. In the case shown in Fig. 3B, when the C
                        ss is 3-fold of IC50 the maximal drop of P3 is only 2.1 fold lower than the value with C
                        ss at IC50.

When inhibition stops after P2 in most cases has reached the new steady state (at 2400h), P2 returns to the original baseline as expected (Fig. 2A). The time taken for the return is consistent with that taken to achieve the new steady state. As for P3, having already bounced back to the initial baseline following a steady inhibition of K
                        21, inhibitor withdrawing results in an overshot as exhibited in Fig. 2B and 3B. The extent of the jump above the baseline correlates with the fall following the inhibition. This overshot may be accounted for by the increased portion of P2 that acts as an additional source for P3 when the system is moving back to the original status.

In cases when P2 and P3 also undergo degradation like P1 (Model 2), the response of P2 and P3 to the inhibition becomes complex. With the same extent of OGA inhibition (C
                        ss
                        =IC50), the magnitude of P2 and P3 changes depends on the significance of individual pathways. Three scenarios are evaluated: (A) K
                        out2
                        =
                        K
                        out3
                        >0; (B) K
                        out2
                        >0 and K
                        out3
                        =0; (C) K
                        out2
                        =0, K
                        out3
                        >0. The simulated results are presented in Fig. 4A–C. Curve legends P2_A, P2_B and P2_C indicate simulations for P2 performed with K
                        out2 and/or K
                        out3 of 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1h−1 (i.e. 0.1-, 1- and 10-fold of K
                        out1). The same applies to P3 curves. The following simulations for scenarios A and B reveal varying new steady state levels of P2 and P3 and the results are summarized in Table 3
                        .


                        Fig. 4A describes the situations where P2 and P3 undergo degradation at the same rate (K
                        out2
                        =
                        K
                        out3). The simulated result indicates that the temporal profiles of P2 and P3 vary with K
                        out2 and K
                        out3 relative to K
                        out1. Increasing K
                        out2 and K
                        out3 leads to less elevation of P2 and greater sustained decline of P3. With K
                        out2 and K
                        out3 being 0.1-, 1- and 10-fold of K
                        out1, P2 increases by 1.85-, 1.50- and 1.34-fold, respectively. The impact on the maximal P3 decline is less appreciable, but the decline becomes sustained, especially when K
                        out2 and K
                        out3 are equal to or greater than K
                        out1. Under these two conditions, inhibition withdrawal does not cause the overshot of P3. It is worth noting that with K
                        out2 and K
                        out3 becoming more important, P2 and P3 reach the new steady state faster.


                        Fig. 4B delineates the scenarios where P2 undergoes degradation while P3 does not (K
                        out2
                        >0 and K
                        out3
                        =0). Qualitatively, the simulated result in Fig. 4B is similar to that shown in Fig. 4A. Differences emerge when K
                        out2 is equal to or greater than K
                        out1 that P2 rises first and then falls to a new steady level that is lower than that shown in Fig. 4A. At the new equilibrium, P1 and P3 are lower in absolute amount compared with the value prior to K
                        21 inhibition and the difference becomes greater as K
                        out2 increases (data not shown). It is conceivable that increasing P2 via K
                        21 inhibition accelerates the turnover of the whole protein pool when the direct clearance of P2 gets more efficient. When inhibition stops, there is a slight undershot before P2 returns to the original baseline (Curves P2_B and P2_C), apparently attributing to the lowered P1 and P3 that take the elevated P2 to make up the loss before the newly synthesized form is available for the recovery. On the other hand, P3 curves are basically similar to those in Fig. 4A except for a slightly greater reduction when K
                        out2 is set at 0.1h−1 (Curve P3_C).


                        Fig. 4C shows the cases where P3 undergoes degradation while P2 does not (K
                        out3
                        >0 and K
                        out2
                        =0). In general, the responses of P2 and P3 mirror those described by Model 1 (Fig. 2A and B). First, P2 level invariably doubles at any rate of P3 degradation when C
                        ss equals the IC50. However, varying K
                        out3 changes the turnover rate of P2 as it takes less time for P2 to reach the new steady state as K
                        out3 increases. In parallel, P3 first drops and then gradually rises to the original baseline, but the degree of the maximal drop decreases in company with a faster rise to the baseline as K
                        out3 increases.

Among the above three scenarios, only in the last one (K
                        out2
                        =0, K
                        out3
                        >0) P2 elevation is proportional to the level of C
                        ss. The other two situations give rise to disproportionality in this regard. The disproportionality becomes more remarkable as the significance of the related pathways increases. With scenario A as an example, 6-fold increase in C
                        ss leads to about 5-fold increase in P2 (2.19/0.44) when K
                        out2 and K
                        out3 are 0.001h−1. The magnitude of increase becomes only 3-fold (0.61/0.20) when the rate constants are 0.1h−1 (Table 3). The trend holds true with scenario B with even more remarkable disproportionality. The impact of K
                        out2 is also reflected by the degree of P2 elevation at C
                        ss equivalent to the IC50. As shown in Table 3 again, the increase is 1.85- and 1.50-fold in scenario A with K
                        out2 at 0.001 and 0.01h−1. The value becomes 1.83 and 1.33-fold in scenario B. This variation suggests that when P2 degradation becomes more dominant (a greater K
                        out2), the impact of reducing K
                        21 on P2 will diminish.

As aforementioned, in scenarios A and B, P3 arrives at a new steady level upon continuous inhibition of K
                        21. This new level varies with the importance of P2 degradation pathway (K
                        out2). Unlike P2, increasing K
                        out2 leads to more significant decline of P3. For instance, P3 is reduced by only 8% when K
                        out2 is 0.001h−1 and the value increases to 33% when K
                        out2 is 0.01h−1 (Table 3). It appears that a greater rate of P2 degradation facilitates the right shift of the equilibrium when K
                        21 is inhibited, leading to more significant drop of P3. Regarding the exposure-response relationship, P3 also declines less than proportionally with the C
                        ss, and the degree of disproportionality is almost identical to that seen with P2 (Table 3).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Inhibition of OGA by potent, selective inhibitors is intended to lower the level of phosphorylated tau protein, an approach mainly founded on the reciprocal relationship of protein phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation. Although an intuitive expectation, this approach appears to have panned out well in cells and, importantly, in animals with acute or short term treatment. Observations of the expected results have captured the interest from both academia and pharmaceutical industry. A recent report by Yuzwa et al. (2012) on the result from a long term treatment of JNPL3 tau transgenic mice with Thiamet G is encouraging in that the resultant elevation of O-GlcNAcylation appeared to slow neurodegeneration and to stabilize tau against aggregation. However, the expected decrease in phosphorylated protein was not observed, in contrast to previously reported in vitro and short term in vivo results. Intrigued by this seemingly contradictory finding, we built up a mathematical model to simulate the effect of long-term OGA inhibition on O-GlcNAcyated and phosphorylated proteins. All simulations were performed with intravenous infusion for two reasons. The first is to remove the PK variability from the complexity of the outcomes, as mentioned in the section of methods. The second is to mimic the experimental conditions in the cited work where Thiamet G was given in drinking water for 36 weeks, similar to chronic steady administration to some degree. Our analyses indicate that under steady inhibition of OGA, O-GlcNAcylated protein (P2) increases to a new level (Fig. 2A), as expected. In contrast, phosphorylated protein (P3) declines first and then gradually bounces back to the original baseline (Fig. 2B). This predicted temporal profile of phosphorylated protein change is in good agreement with what was observed in the experiment.

The disparity of phosphorylated protein response between acute or short term and long term in vivo treatment resides on the impact of the turnover of the naked protein, which is formed continuously and broken down slowly (relative to the modification and reversal processes). It can be envisaged that when OGA inhibition leads to the increase in O-GlcNAcylated protein, the increased fraction should first come from the pool of phosphorylated protein, which is quickly hydrolyzed to the naked form to be O-GlcNAcyted by OGT. Therefore, in a short time after OGA inhibition, the whole protein pool can be considered as a closed system, analogous to in vitro experimental conditions, because the newly synthesized naked protein is lagged behind the flux from phosphorylated protein to O-GlcNAcylated protein by the action of the two pairs of enzymes. In this period of time, the temporal profile of phosphorylated protein mainly reflects this flux. However, the continuous synthesis of the naked protein serves as a steady supply that makes up the loss of phosphorylated protein and brings it back to the baseline controlled by the rate constants K
                     13 and K
                     31. As for O-GlcNAc form, it will reach a new steady state that is defined by K
                     12 and the new, reduced K
                     21 due to the effect of inhibitor. The overall outcome is the increased ratio of O-GlcNAcylated to phosphorylated form. If this increased O-GlcNAc modification alone attributes to the protective effects against tau protein aggregation, inhibition of OGA may still be a viable mechanism to pursue in the quest for pharmacological interventions to slow down neurodegenerative process, even though the approach may not exert impact on tau phosphorylation in chronic treatment. Strengthening this notion is a recent finding that an OGA inhibitor attenuates β-amyloid plaque and rescues memory impairment in the 5XFAD mice (Kim et al., 2013). The mechanism is believed to be attributed to the lowered γ-secretase due to the increased O-GlcNAcylated modification at S708 in nicastrin (a component of γ-secretase complex).

From a modeling perspective, the diminished decrease of tau phosphorylation following the long term inhibition of OGA may imply at least two possibilities. The first one is that the turnover of the modified tau (either phosphorylated or O-GlcNAcylated) is negligible, if any, as compared with that of the naked protein. In this case, Model 1 may better capture the dynamics of tau protein. Regardless of the scarce knowledge about tau in vivo turnover, there is some in vitro evidence suggestive of an enhanced resistance of phosphorylated tau to the turnover by the proteasome (Poppek et al., 2006). However, phosphorylated tau is known to be subject to aggregation followed by deposition (Avila et al., 2006). This process can be viewed as a clearance mechanism for the soluble phosphorylated tau. This possibility can be captured by Model 2 with K
                     out3
                     >0. The unclear component in this model is the turnover of O-GlcNAcylated tau; the pertaining information appears lacking. Nevertheless, the return of phosphorylated tau to the baseline under long and steady inhibition of OGA may serve as a piece of indirect evidence that supports the lack of detectable breakdown of O-GlcNAcylated tau in vivo. Ideally, the model should be validated with experimental data that allow for the estimation of parameters of tau dynamics in animals first and then translated into clinical settings. Quantitative characterization of the interplay of O-GlcNAc and phosphorylated tau proteins, although resource and time consuming, is an effort worth undertaking for a greater probability of success when OGA is pursued as the target for pharmacological intervention of tauopathies. It is also important to point out that the simulations in this work were performed under a couple of assumptions. Firstly, all reactions governing protein modification and de-modification are assumed to proceed in a first-order manner. This assumption may be reasonable for tau protein because neuronal tau concentration is about 2μM (Avila, 2010), significantly lower than the reported K
                     m values for any reactions involved (Liu et al., 2005; Peterson et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2006). However, this assumption may not apply to cases where species concentration is low given the complexity of the system. Secondly, the biological system is assumed to be invariable during the dosing period. Caution should be taken with this assumption. OGA is known to be up-regulated under certain pathophysiological conditions (Park et al., 2010), indicating the inducibility of this enzyme. Conceivably, constant inhibition of the enzyme may change its regulation. This occurrence, if unfolded, should be factored in when extrapolation of acute or short term intervention to long term treatment.

In a broader sense, our analyses with Model 2 indicate that, for any pair of biological responses that are reciprocally regulated, the effectiveness of modulating one response (P3 in this case) through manipulating its counterpart (P2 in this case) depends on how the latter is disposed. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, only when P2 has an appreciable pathway out (K
                     out2
                     >0) can the blockade of P2 reversal to P1 lead to sustained P3 reduction. This is because the elevated P2 will result in a greater rate of its elimination and therefore shift the equilibrium of the whole system to the right. In the case where reduction of P3 is required for a desired therapy, it would be very important in the phase of target validation to understand all P2 degradation pathways. In addition, the biological process described by our model encompasses several pathways that could in theory be modulated according to a given situation. Thus, the model can be useful to evaluate the feasibility of targeting a particular pathway. Another important advantage of the model is that the pharmacokinetic components of the inhibitor and dynamic properties of biological responses are integrated. Although only intravenous infusion is covered in this work, any route of administration with any regimen can be readily applied to predict the time-course of inhibitor concentration and biological response of interest under various conditions. For instance, a bolus dosing can predict hysteresis and response fluctuation; single versus repeated dosing can delineate the difference of acute response and steady state outcome. Undoubtedly, such information is critical in every stage of drug discovery and development.

In summary, we have constructed a mathematical model to capture the dynamics of reciprocally modified proteins. With this model, we have predicted the time-course of respective modified proteins in response to the inhibition of a reverse pathway. These analyses have provided insights into the different outcomes of phosphorylated tau protein with OGA inhibition for different length. Since relevant information on tau in vivo dynamics is lacking currently, the predictions should be considered as a qualitative and conceptual description. However, the model could have wide applications for any biological systems that are reciprocally regulated, especially in providing guidance in target selection and validation. The model also can be easily modified to fit any given situations which may vary either in pharmacokinetic respects or in pharmacodynamic characteristics. We believe that with the increasing role of systems biology in life sciences, the potential of modeling approach will greatly facilitate the quest for better therapies.

Steady-state equations and initial concentrations of P1, P2 and P3

P1, P2 and P3 at steady state are designated P1(0), P2(0) and P3(0), respectively. At steady state, there is no change in model variables. Therefore, time derivatives in Eqs. (1), (7) and (8) can be set to 0 resulting in a system of three algebraic equations:
