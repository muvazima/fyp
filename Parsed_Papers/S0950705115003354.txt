                  We introduce a new multiple criteria ranking/choice method that applies Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) and represents the Decision Maker’s (DM’s) preferences with decision rules. The DM provides a set of pairwise comparisons indicating whether an outranking (weak preference) relation should hold for some pairs of reference alternatives. This preference information is structured using the lower and upper approximations of outranking (S) and non-outranking (

                     ) relations. Then, all minimal-cover (MC) sets of decision rules being compatible with this preference information are induced. Each of these sets is supported by some positive examples (pairs of reference alternatives from the lower approximation of a preference relation) and it does not cover any negative example (pair of alternatives from the upper approximation of an opposite preference relation). The recommendations obtained by all MC sets of rules are analyzed to describe pairwise outranking and non-outranking relations, using probabilistic indices (estimates of probabilities that one alternative outranks or does not outrank the other). Furthermore, given the preference relations obtained in result of application of each MC set of rules on a considered set of alternatives, we exploit them using some scoring procedures. From this, we derive the distribution of ranks attained by the alternatives. We also extend the basic approach in several ways. The practical usefulness of the method is demonstrated on a problem of ranking Polish cities according to their innovativeness.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper, we consider choice and ranking problems where alternatives are evaluated on multiple, often conflicting, criteria. Choice problems are oriented toward selecting a subset of the most prevailing alternatives, whereas in ranking problems one aims at imposing a preference order on the set of alternatives. The only conclusion which can be derived from the analysis of performances of the considered alternatives on multiple criteria is the dominance relation among them. Leaving many alternatives incomparable, this relation prevents, however, their clear ranking or straightforward discrimination between alternatives that should be selected and neglected. Thus, to work out a recommendation, the Decision Maker (DM) needs to enrich the dominance relation by providing some extra preference information which is subsequently transformed into a mathematical preference model. The application of the preference model induces a preference structure on the set of alternatives. The ranking or choice recommendation can be derived from its proper exploitation. In Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA), there exist three basic ways of modeling preference information coming from the DM: value functions [35], relational systems [42], or “if 
                        
                           …
                        
                     , then 
                        
                           …
                        
                     ” decision rules [19,20,47].

These models need to faithfully represent the elements of DM’s value system. In this perspective, they can be tuned using either direct or indirect preference statements. Since the previous need a considerable cognitive effort on the DM’s part, the recent decision aiding methods are designed so that to accommodate indirect or incomplete preference information. In the context of multiple criteria ranking and choice, such preference information is composed of some exemplary decisions concerning a small subset of reference alternatives. Although these judgments may have different forms (for a review, see [9]), the majority of methods employ pairwise comparisons.

With indirect and incomplete specification of preferences, there are typically several instances of the preference model (i.e., functions, relations, or sets of rules) that are consistent with the preference statements. While all such compatible instances reproduce the preference information provided by the DM for reference alternatives, the recommendation delivered for the non-reference ones may vary significantly from one instance to another. The potential diversity of the suggested recommendation motivated the development of a framework for robustness analysis. Dealing with the plurality of compatible preference model instances in the context of ranking and choice problems has been already considered for two out of three preference models used in MCDA: a value function and an outranking relation.

When analyzing the robustness of recommendation obtained with a value-based preference model, we may identify such pairs of alternatives that the comprehensive value of the first one is at least as good as that of the second one for all value functions, and strictly higher for some value functions [27,55]. A similar result in the setting of Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) corresponds to the necessary and possible preference relations [10,25]. Moreover, we may take into account ranks attained by the alternatives by indicating either potentially optimal alternatives (i.e., these which can by ranked first by some compatible value function) [27,37] or, more generally, the whole range of ranks for each alternative by conducting extreme ranking analysis [31]. Finally, within the framework of Stochastic Ordinal Regression (SOR), one may estimate probabilities of both preference relations and attaining some rank, using the Monte Carlo simulation [34,36].

When it comes to outranking-based ranking and choice methods, the robustness concern has been raised by Dias and Clímaco [11], Greco et al. [16], and Kadziński et al. [31]. These approaches admit indirect and partial preference information concerning parameters of the model used in ELECTRE (see, e.g., [13]) or PROMETHEE (see, e.g., [7]). Having constructed a set of relational systems compatible with the DM’s preferences, they verify the possibility and necessity of an outranking relation for each pair of alternatives by checking if it holds for, respectively, at least one or all admissible combinations of parameter values.

The above review proves that robustness analysis has been widely used as a decision aiding tool within value- and outranking-based ranking and choice methods. Nevertheless, it has not received due attention in the context of decision rules. This model has been introduced to decision analysis several years ago, quickly gaining popularity because of its explanation potential and recommendation formulated in a natural language. The use of decision rules in MCDA is inseparably connected with Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) [19,47] (for some recent advances or applications of DRSA, see, e.g., [2,3,8,28,39,38,40]). It structures the data so that sets of alternatives (in case of sorting problems) or sets of pairs of alternatives (in case of ranking and choice problems) are represented by the lower and upper approximations of decision classes or preference relations, respectively [41].

In adaptation of DRSA to multiple criteria ranking [17], the DM provides a set of pairwise comparisons indicating whether an outranking (weak preference) relation should hold (S) or not (
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                        ) for some reference alternatives. Decision rules which are induced from the approximations of comprehensive outranking (S) and non-outranking (
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                        ) relations concern pairs of alternatives. Their application on the set of alternatives yields a specific preference relation in this set. This relation needs to be further exploited with some ranking method that arranges the alternatives in a preference order (see, e.g., [6,12,51,52]).

Many algorithms for induction of decision rules have been introduced in the context of multiple criteria ranking approached with DRSA. The vast majority of these algorithms generates a minimal-cover (MC) set of minimal decision rules [5,17,51,52]. In this way, pairs of alternatives from the lower or upper approximations of outranking and non-outranking relations are described with the set of most general, complete and non-redundant “if 
                           
                              …
                           
                        , then 
                           
                              …
                           
                        ” statements. However, there are usually multiple sets of rules satisfying these properties, and the existing algorithms select a single one in an arbitrary pre-defined way. Obviously, the ranking or choice recommendation that can be obtained for any compatible set of rules can vary significantly.

The aim of this paper is to introduce an approach for multiple criteria ranking and choice with all MC sets of rules compatible with the DM’s indirect and incomplete preference information. Analogously to An and Tong [1], Greco et al. [17,16], Szelag et al. [51,52], we expect the DM to provide a set of pairwise comparisons stating the truth (S) or falsity (
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                        ) of the outranking relation for some reference alternatives. Thus exhibited preference information is treated as deterministic, and structured using the lower and upper approximations of outranking and non-outranking relations. Then, all MC sets of decision rules being compatible with this preference information are induced from the structured information, such that rules suggesting S are induced with the hypothesis that the lower approximation of S provides positive examples and the upper approximation of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                         provides negative examples, and vice versa in case of inducing rules suggesting 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                        . The compatibility of inferred rule sets with the exhibited DM’s preference information is due to the fact that these sets cover all pairs of reference alternatives from the lower approximation of S and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                        , respectively. In this regard, analogously to other MCDA methods based on indirect preference information, the supplied pairwise comparisons constrain the flexibility of compatible preference model instances. In our case, a compatible instance of the preference model is a minimal set of minimal rules covering all pairs of reference alternatives compared by the DM and included in lower approximations of S and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                         – it is called MC set of rules.

The recommendations obtained by all MC sets of rules are analyzed to describe the stability of outranking and non-outranking by means of the necessary and the possible, as well as by the probabilistic indices (estimates of probabilities that one alternative outranks or does not outrank the other). To pass from the robustness analysis of the preference relations imposed on the set of alternatives to the recommended ranking/choice, we exploit them using different scoring procedures and derive the distribution of ranks attained by the alternatives. We also extend the basic approach in several ways.

The approach presented in this paper can be seen as a rule-based counterpart of Robust and Stochastic Ordinal Regression methods with value- [25,34] and outranking-based [16] preference models. In this regard, our main contribution is in the phase of construction of the DM’s preference model. Precisely, we extend the existing rule-based methods for multiple criteria ranking and choice [5,17,14,51,52] to take into account all compatible MC set of rules, and not only one such set. Note, however, that when using value- or outranking-based preference model, either all compatible preference model instances are considered implicitly by taking into account a set of Linear Programming (LP) constraints or one analyzes a proper subset of all instances obtained with the Monte Carlo simulation. On the contrary, when dealing with decision rules, all compatible MC sets of rules need to be constructed explicitly.

Furthermore, our proposal is a ranking/choice counterpart of the DRSA-based framework for robustness analysis for multiple criteria sorting (ordinal classification) problems [33]. In this regard, the main innovation of the paper is in the phase of exploitation of the preference model. It consists in adapting different concepts and measures of robustness to the specific context of DRSA applied to ranking/choice problems. Thus, instead of investigating the stability of class assignments as in [33], we rather focus on the pairwise preference relations and ranks attained by the alternatives.

Finally, analogously to the approach presented by Greco et al. [26], we are putting DRSA and ROR together for multiple criteria ranking and choice. However, instead of providing the explanations of the necessary and possible preference relations in terms of rules, we rather construct such robust relations using all compatible sets of decision rules.

In Section 2, we recall some basic concepts of DRSA. In Section 3, we discuss an algorithm for generating all compatible MC sets of rules. In Sections 4 and 5, we discuss measures for investigating the robustness of the recommendation suggested by all compatible MC sets of rules. In Section 6, we account for dealing with incompatibility of preference information. Section 7 proposes how to ensure consistency between the ranking obtained with the scoring procedures and the provided preference information. Section 8 describes a decision aiding process for the proposed approach. Section 9 concludes the paper.

In particular, the DM may specify a complete pre-order for the subset of reference alternatives. Subsequently, these statements are automatically translated to the respective outranking and non-outranking relations, i.e., if

Following the paradigm of ordinal regression [29], we assume the DM has some knowledge about the considered alternatives, and thus, that (s)he is able to express preferences by comparing pairwise some reference alternatives relatively well known to this DM. The selection of pairs to be compared does not follow any specific algorithm made in DM’s mind; the order of selection may, however, be dependent on the DM’s conviction that a pair of alternatives should be compared in a given way.

The subset of reference alternatives can be composed of real or fictitious alternatives, that refer to some real past decisions of the DM, or to some hypothetical decisions that the DM is generating in order to exemplify her/his preferences [16]. In any case, the pairs selected for comparison cannot be related by the dominance relation. Only in this way, the expressed preference information may be used to enrich the dominance order following directly from multiple criteria evaluations of alternatives.

For the purpose of illustration, we consider a real world problem of innovation assessment for a subset of Polish cities. It was originally presented in [45]. We consider a set of 16 cities evaluated on six criteria with an increasing direction of preference: incomes (in PLN) per inhabitant (

The approach presented in this paper represents the pairwise comparisons expressed by the DM with all compatible MC sets of minimal decision rules. On the one hand, the choice of “if …, then …” decision rules is motivated by their interpretability and favorable characteristics as an aggregation operator. In particular, they represent a form of dependency between conditions on some criteria and the exhibited decision about preference relation for a pair of alternatives. On the other hand, inferring all compatible instances of a preference model rather than a single instance is a sign of acting with prudence. In this regard, our aim is to provide the DM with the results of applying all equally desirable preference model instances rather than a single instance selected in an arbitrary way.

In what follows, we focus on certain decision rules which are induced from the lower approximations. For a given relation S (

A certain decision rule is compatible with a piece of the preference information provided by the DM because it is supported by some positive examples (pairs of reference alternatives from the lower approximation of a preference relation) and it does not cover any negative example (pair of alternatives from the upper approximation of an opposite preference relation). Thus, any set of certain minimal decision rules covering all pairs of reference alternatives from the lower approximation of S and

                      is compatible with the whole preference information provided by the DM.

In this section, we discuss an algorithm for generating all compatible MC sets of rules. It starts with generating an exhaustive set of all minimal decision rules (see Section 3.1), and then finds all minimal covers of pairs of alternatives with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) (see Section 3.3).

In this subsection, we discuss an algorithm which generates all certain minimal decision rules

                        . Among these, there are 10 rules with just a single condition, 19 rules with two ones, and 6 rules with three conditions.

We are interested in generating the complete sets of rules, which means that each of these sets is able to cover all pairs of reference alternatives compared by the DM and included in lower approximations of S and

                        . These sets are fully authorized to pretend that they represent preferences of the DM exhibited through the provided pairwise comparisons. Inviting the DM to make her/his own selection of rules would mean that we require from the DM an extra preference information with respect to selected rules. As the number of all rules can be quite large, this would require a cognitive effort on the part of the DM which is non-acceptable.

Robustness analysis accounts for the inaccuracy, uncertainty, and biases observed in the actual decision support processes. In our case, the reasons underlying these imperfections include the incompleteness of pairwise comparisons of reference alternatives (as opposed to a complete ranking of all alternatives) and indetermination in the definition of a single instance of the preference model while there exist many compatible MC rule sets (as opposed to an arbitrary selection of a single set of rules). As noted by Kadziński and Tervonen [34], investigation of the robustness of the provided conclusions consists in verifying whether they are valid for all or for the most plausible instances of an assumed preference model.

The pairwise outranking and non-outranking indices can be interpreted as estimates of a probability of, respectively, outranking and non-outranking relations for an ordered pair of alternatives [34]. In this way, their main role is to indicate how often the possible (though non-necessary) results are observed in case of the indetermination of the preference model caused by consideration of all compatible MC sets of rules instead of a single model being one MC set of rules.

If these indices are positive, then the respective possible preference relation holds, whereas in case they are equal to one, the necessary relations is true. Since a single compatible MC set of rules may suggest for a pair

In the e-Appendix C, we show how to construct a single representative set of rules by exploiting the indices

In this section, we discuss several procedures exploiting the results obtained with all compatible MC sets of rules 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       A
                                    
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     . These approaches deliver a recommendation in terms of ranking of all alternatives or in form of a subset of the potential best options. We refer to a representative sample of algorithms that can be devised, bearing in mind that a large spectrum of other exploitation procedures could be applied in this context as well. The proposed scoring procedures either directly exploit the relations S and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                        
                      using the Net Flow Score (NFS) method (see, e.g., [24]), or transform them first into a fuzzy relation FR over set A 
                     [52]. The third possibility, not illustrated in this paper, consists in a separate exploitation of relations S and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                        
                     , leading to two separate pre-orders, which are subsequently combined into a final ranking in the spirit of ELECTRE III [13].

Let us recall that given a single set of rules 
                           
                              R
                           
                        , the traditionally used NFS procedure computes for each alternative 
                           
                              a
                              ∈
                              A
                           
                         a single score indicating its quality derived from the comparison with the remaining alternatives. The final ranking is determined by 
                           
                              NFS

                              a

                              R

                         (the greater the score, the better), whereas the subset of the best options is formed by these with the highest scores. In the context of outcomes obtained by applying a single set of rules

Thus, the strength of a is derived from outranking other alternatives and not being outranked by them, whereas its weakness comes from non-outranking other alternatives and being outranked by them. Precisely, these measures of desirability are computed so that each alternative 
                           
                              b

                         satisfying the above mentioned relations contributes with a positive or negative point to the comprehensive score of a. We will adapt this formula to the case of all compatible MC sets of decision rules considered together.

Thus defined positive indices support the strength of a, whereas the negative indices quantify its weakness. These arguments are represented graphically in Fig. 2
                        a). The above mentioned indices can be aggregated with a cumulative outranking index COI, being the measure of the desirability of a with respect to all sets of rules compatible with the DM’s preferences:

Although there exist many ranking methods that can be used for exploiting a fuzzy relation over B (for a review, see [52]), one of the most frequently used is “sum in favor”, defined in the following way:

                         results in a weak order over A, we may analyze rank acceptability indices analogously as in Section 5.1.

When using value- or outranking-based MCDA methods, in case of inconsistency of the DM’s preference information, two alternative approaches are employed. If the DM accepts that some of her/his statements will not be reproduced by any preference model instance, the analysis is performed while controlling the value of an acceptable total error. Otherwise, the troublesome pieces of preference information responsible for the incompatibility need to be identified with Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), and then removed or revised.

The framework of DRSA offers different possibilities for dealing with inconsistency. When referring to the certain decision rules generated from the lower approximations, we take into account a consistent part of the DM’s preference information. However, we may also consider possible decision rules derived from the upper approximations. In this way, we investigate consequences of the provided preference information while accounting for the inconsistency. Obviously, in case of inconsistency the analyst should decide whether to consider either certain or possible rules, or both of them. In any case, since the sets of rules do differ, the results of their application on the set of alternatives differ as well.

For the purpose of illustration, let us assume that the DM provided a different ranking for reference alternatives:

In Table 8
                        , we present selected compatible certain and possible rules obtained with Algorithm 3 provided in the e-Appendix B. These are all rules which are contained in the minimal sets of rules given in Table 9
                        . For depicting the exemplary recommendation that can be obtained with all MC sets of certain and possible rules, we present selected aggregated measures in Table 10
                        . These are net flow scores, cumulative outranking indices, expected ranks, and extreme ranks. Their comparison reveals slight differences in values of these measures and/or the respective ranks. In particular, when comparing the pairs of rankings obtained with NFS, COI, and HAI, with certain or possible rules, the similarities quantified with Kendall’s τ are equal to, respectively, 0.89, 0.94, and 1.0.

The approach presented in this paper is also valid in case of Variable Consistency Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (VC-DRSA) [4,52]. VC-DRSA produces greater lower approximations than those computed by traditional DRSA, containing alternatives or pairs of alternatives strongly, though not necessarily, related with the approximated sets. To quantify the degree of this relation, the following consistency measure

                        . Thus, a suitable extension of Algorithm 3 provided in the e-Appendix B to the VC-DRSA setting is straightforward.

Although pairwise comparisons provided by the DM are reproduced by the induced sets of rules, it is well-known that when exploited with NFS the order for some pairs of reference alternatives may be inversed (for a more thorough discussion, see [52]). For example, even though the DM required

                     ). Dealing with this problem, we may follow the approach proposed by Kadziński et al. [31] for outranking-based PROMETHEE method by distinguishing the construction and exploitation levels of the outranking relation. The former refers to the comparison of performances of a and b, and is modeled with decision rules. The latter refers to the ranks attained by a and b, and is modeled with respect to their net flow scores. To avoid the problem of rank reversals at the exploitation level, we may take into account only these sets of rules that reproduce DM’s preferences at both levels instead of construction level only. Referring to the exploitation level, we may also account for different types of holistic preference information such as rank-related requirements [32].

Ranking and choice decisions can be aided with the proposed approach through the iterative process illustrated in Fig. 3
                     . The process begins by defining the problem in Step 1. This requires specification of a set of alternatives A, a set of criteria G, and the performance matrix. Then, in Step 2 pairwise comparisons for a small subset of reference alternatives are elicited (see Section 2).

Step 3 consists of structuring the provided preference information using the lower and upper approximation of relations S and

                     ), the DM may revise her preference information or decide to continue the analysis with inconsistency (see Section 6). Then, in Step 4, we construct a set of all MC sets of rules by first generating an exhaustive set of all minimal decision rules, and then finding all minimal covers of pairs of alternatives with ILP (see Section 3).

Step 5 consists of building a ranking/choice recommendation. First, we construct the necessary and possible relations and compute the respective probabilistic indices (see Section 4). Depending on the selected logic (either two or four valued), these results may refer to, respectively, outranking and non-outranking or true, false, unknown, and contradictory outranking. We may also apply different scoring procedures which either directly exploit the outranking relations or first transform them into a single fuzzy relation (see Section 5). The results that can be derived from such analysis express the probabilities that alternatives attain particular ranks or provide a complete order with respect to, e.g., cumulative outranking indices, holistic acceptability indices, net flow scores, or comprehensive sum in favor scores. These results may be additionally enriched with a selection of a representative set of rules (see e-Appendix C). Obviously, in Step 5 we may use only a small subset of results that may be delivered within the proposed framework.

The above procedures should be used only in case a numerical score has to be assigned to each alternative [44]. The analyst needs to be aware that they may deliver different rankings. Since there is no single best approach that can be adopted in the context of all real-world problems, the selection of a particular procedure should be motivated by its properties and underlying logic. In particular, COI is appropriate for aggregation of the numerical scores derived from the exploitation of outranking relation determined individually by each compatible set of rules. Further, NFS is relevant for an analogous aggregation limited, however, only to the most certain recommendation provided by all sets of rules considered jointly. Finally, HAI should be used when the analyst cares more about the ordinal ranks (rather than the numerical scores) stemming from the application of each rule set. Additionally, each of these procedures may be useful for making the respective outcome of robustness analysis more descriptive and comprehensible (i.e., NFS for

All provided results are verified in Step 6; if the DM is satisfied with the recommendation, the process ends. Otherwise, one should revise the input data and/or enrich the preference information. The suggested procedure is to provide new pairwise comparisons for these pairs for which we observe the possible though non-necessary relation at the current stage of interaction.

Let us emphasize that our proposal implements a constructivist approach postulated in MCDA [9,43]. We do not assume that a preference model is an entity that is pre-existing in the DM’s mind which need to be discovered by the algorithm. Indeed, neither the objective truth/recommendation nor the “true” form/values of the preference model exist. On the contrary, we assume that the model is constructed in course of an interaction with the method. We intentionally force the DM to confront her/his value system with a variety of results of applying the inferred preference model on the set of alternatives rather than provide a clear-cut ranking/choice. In this way, (s)he should gain insights on her/his value system and better understand the employed method.

This contrasts with the discovery of statistically validated preference patterns which is postulated in machine learning (see, e.g., [15]). As a result, the problems of referring directly to the estimation paradigm within an empirical comparison or measuring the method’s effectiveness in terms of a misranking error, are ill-founded in our context. This issue is widely discussed by Corrente et al. [9].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We presented a new approach for dealing with multiple criteria ranking problems. The approach derives from Dominance-based Rough Set Approach, and considers all MC sets of minimal rules compatible with the pairwise comparisons provided by the DM. Then, the method provides acceptability indices for pairwise preference relations as well as for all pairs of alternatives and ranks. These correspond to the estimates of the probabilities that one alternative outranks (does not outrank) the other or attains some particular rank. Such probabilistic results may be used to obtain the necessary and possible outranking relations and extreme ranks. These relations are confirmed by all or at least one compatible MC set of rules, whereas the extreme ranks for each alternative are obtained with Net Flow Score exploitation of the most and least advantageous sets of rules. All these results may be aggregated to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the alternatives in terms of a recommendation provided by all compatible sets of rules. In particular, we proposed to consider a cumulative outranking index (average net flow score) or a holistic acceptability index (expected rank). We also discussed several extensions of the main approach. These include selection of the representative MC set of rules as well as an application of possible rules along with the certain ones. The introduced method was illustrated using an example of ranking Polish cities according to their innovativeness.

The complexity of generating all compatible rules is exponential and identification of the minimal sets of rules by solving a set cover problem is NP-hard. Thus, the proposed approach requires a considerable amount of computational time. For example, the execution time for our illustrative problem on Intel Atom CPU D325 1.80GHz with 4GB RAM was about 60s. This enables dealing with modestly sized ranking and choice problems considered in MCDA where it is unrealistic to assume to the DM provides more than few tens of holistic judgments [49]. However, the high computational complexity prevents using the proposed method in the context of big data problems where the preference information comes from the observation of users’ behavior rather than from direct questioning of the DM.

Nevertheless, the benefits of using all compatible sets of rules far outweigh the complexity of the proposed algorithms. Even solely with the illustrative study, we prove how much information is neglected by other existing approaches and how arbitrary is the recommendation provided by them. In any case, to address the existence of multiple sets of rules and avoid heavy calculations, we may refer to some sequential covering algorithm (see, e.g., [4,23], or [52]) and run it a certain number of times. Each run should be either perturbed, e.g., by not choosing always the best candidate for the elementary condition, or limited to a subset of criteria (e.g., the reducts [46,50]). This would allow induction of multiple compatible sets of rules, which may be further analyzed in terms of robustness of provided recommendation in the usual way.

The whole approach can be extended in several ways, in particular, by:
                        
                           •
                           considering only satisfactory sets of rules being consistent with some pre-defined user requirements;

adapting to group decision problems [8,21];

accounting for the decision under uncertainty [22,48] formulated as a multiple criteria ranking problem;

identification of minimal sets of the provided pairwise comparisons that imply the obtained possible and necessary preference relations [30],

implementing a Map-Reduce version of the algorithms for generating all compatible rules and using some heuristic procedures for generating the minimal covers.
