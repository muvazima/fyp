                  The main objective of this paper is to propose an optimization strategy which uses partially converged data to minimize the computational effort associated with an optimization procedure. The framework of this work is the optimization of assemblies involving contact and friction.
                  Several tools have been developed in order to use a surrogate model as an alternative to the actual mechanical model. Then, the global optimization can be carried out using this surrogate model, which is much less expensive. This approach has two drawbacks: the CPU time required to generate the surrogate model and the inaccuracy of this model.
                  In order to alleviate these drawbacks, we propose to minimize the CPU time by using partially converged data and then to apply a correction strategy. Two methods are tested in this paper. The first one consists in updating a partially converged metamodel using global enrichment. The second one consists in seeking the global minimum using the weighted expected improvement. One can achieve a time saving of about 10 when seeking the global minimum.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The development of numerical tools and mechanical models over the past few years has helped improve the design of complex systems. The ability of modeling and simulation softwares to handle nonlinear problems, which are sources of numerical difficulties, has increased continuously. Aside from resolution difficulties, the computation costs associated with systematic calls to the simulation routines make direct structural optimization unthinkable in an industrial context. In this work, we focus on parameterized assemblies. Let 
                        
                           D
                        
                      be the design space and x a vector of dimension p which contains the p design parameters: x
                     =[x
                     1
                     …
                     x
                     
                        p
                     ].

As recalled in [1], the most efficient optimization methods rely on multilevel optimization concepts, which can be divided into three categories: parallel model optimization based on domain decomposition methods [2,3], multilevel parameter optimization, which consists in replacing an optimization problem by several subproblems, each with a reduced set of parameters [4–7], and multilevel model optimization, which introduces several modeling levels [8–10].

In the context of multilevel optimization, the use of a tool called “metamodel” has become predominant. A metamodel (or surrogate model [11]) is an approximate model of the objective function F(x). This reduced model, denoted 
                        
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 ^
                              
                           
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                     , defined over the whole domain being studied, requires one to simulate a large number of points (which can be very expensive), then associate a mathematical interpolation or regression model with these points [11,12].

In more general case, surrogate models can be divided according to [13] in three categories:
                        
                           •
                           Response surfaces: a response surface is a functional mapping of several input parameters to a single output feature. It could be of polynomial form where regression coefficients are determined by the method of least squares. Typically model properties of interest are those that characterize model fit quality, contribution of an individual variable to total model variance, model resolution, etc. [11] provides a taxonomy of the different processes used to create a surface.

Reduced models derived from the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) or Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD). Readers can find details in [14,15]. More recently PGD was used on parametric models and this approach is initiated the use of the PGD to deal with parametric problems such as parametric optimization problems, inverse identification problems or real time simulation. Some examples of the parametric modelling can be found in [16,17]. PGD was also carried out in the context of Multiparametric Strategy [18].

Hierarchical models, also called multifidelity, variable-fidelity or variable-complexity. In the context of two levels of fidelity, corrections between the two models can be lead, for example [19] uses a kriging model to correct the low-fidelity model on the high-fideliy model. This correction is called scaling model or correction response surface [20,21].

In this general case, the main stumbling block is the computation time of the points of the design domain. In order to overcome this problem, we undertake to develop strategies, inspired by previous works in fluid mechanics, based on partially converged data.

This paper focuses on the construction of metamodels based on partially converged data. Two strategies have been implemented: one to localize the zone of interest (the zone in which the optimum is to be found), and the other to build the complete metamodel with a given level of accuracy.

Classically, optimization techniques begin with a metamodel-based optimization (which is much less time-consuming) in order to locate the zone of interest. Then, the mathematical model associated with the metamodel plays an important role. There are several possible construction approaches, such as kriging [22,12], co-kriging [23–25], the RBF method, etc. In this paper, we use a universal kriging built using the DACE toolbox [26,27]. Kriging was introduced in 1951 by D.G. Krige and later developed, among others, by Matheron [12], who laid out its mathematical foundations.

The kriging technique enables one to determine an approximate function using statistical reasoning. It consists in considering the objective function in the approximate form:

In the case of universal kriging, μ(x) is an approximation by regression over a basis of functions which, usually, are polynomials. It is also important to define a correlation function, which is required for the evaluation of z(x). We use a generalized exponential correlation function similar to that defined in the following equation:

Thus, the optimization, being carried out using this metamodel, is relatively inexpensive. However, such a metamodel, besides being costly to generate, can be inaccurate, which leads to problems in terms of its resolution. In order to alleviate this drawback, there exist metamodel enrichment strategies [28,29], especially the “expected improvement” method [30], which enables one to target the zones of interest more accurately (and, thus, accelerate and improve the optimization). The expected improvement is a probabilistic criterion which defines the improvement which can be achieved in terms of seeking an optimum. Then one carries out the enrichment at a point to the highest expected improvement in order to seek the minimum of the objective function (see Section 3.3).

Strategies based on the calculation of partially converged data have been implemented in order to accelerate the optimization even further. These strategies, which do not necessarily rely on the metamodel tool, can be divided into three main categories.
                        
                           (1)
                           The first category uses different levels of fidelity of the objective function F(x) ([31,19,32]). The techniques developed in the first two references use two levels of fidelity of the objective function whose optimum is being sought. Local optimizations are carried out on the low-fidelity model (LF) using a confidence-region-based algorithm. Then, the high-fidelity model (HF) is evaluated for each resulting optimum in order to guarantee the convergence of the method. This type of algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 1
                              , where f
                              
                                 hf
                               and f
                              
                                 lf
                               denote respectively the HF and LF representations of the objective function.

We can use a correction between the two models to be more accurate.

Another category of methods using metamodels is comparable to the processing of noisy data [33–35]. Indeed, to a certain extent, partially converged data can be viewed as noisy data. One possible approach consists in transforming the universal kriging method into a modified regressive kriging ([35]). One can also use enrichment criteria which are different from those which are generally applied. [33] proposed a modification of the expected improvement criterion [30]. However, we did not use such methods in our work because the results obtained with noisy data and with partially converged data are not comparable.

The last category of methods, which includes our work, makes full use of partially converged data (i.e. points in the design space) [36–39]. The earliest works in that group ([38]) were based on a progressive algorithm, i.e. a local optimization method based on a sequential refinement of the mesh. The main idea is to use an adjoint problem whose solution is the gradient of the objective function, leading to the directions of descent. Two solvers are used: one for the direct problem and the other for the adjoint problem. Partially converged solutions of these problems are sought. Then, the optimization variables are updated along the direction of the gradient and the process is repeated until convergence, i.e. until the estimated gradient of the function reaches a certain threshold. Then, the following step consists in refining the mesh and repeating the various operations down to the finest mesh level (see Algorithm 1).

The results obtained have led to the conclusion [36] that by calculating the evaluation points of the objective function iteratively one rapidly ends up with a good shape of the metamodel after only a few iterations (with a correlation coefficient equal to about 0.95 after 80 iterations instead of 250). Since partially converged data can reproduce the proper shape of a reference metamodel, a correction and enrichment strategy for the partially converged metamodel, called evofusion [37], was implemented in order to improve the available data and target the zones of interest more accurately.

This bibliography emphasizes the fact that there can be no global optimization method based solely on partially converged data. Either a method is suitable for local optimization [38,39], or it uses partial convergence as the first step of an optimization technique [37]. The evofusion method seems to be suitable for our goal of creating a metamodel based on partially converged data. The calculation of partially converged data is the preamble to this strategy. In addition, this type of data seems to have never been used before in the context of the optimization of a solid mechanics problem. This work appears to be the very first one to do so. Here, we will use sample problems involving assemblies with frictional contact [40] to illustrate the results of this approach consisting in building a partially converged, then evofused, metamodel.

The evofusion defined by [37,41] will be customized in order to determine the zone of interest for the subsequent optimization. The advantage of this strategy is that most of the computational effort is focused on seeking the zone of interest rather than wasted on possibly distant zones. We will also use this approach (i.e. a partially converged metamodel corrected through evofusion) to generate a metamodel which is accurate throughout the design space. This is equivalent to a global enrichment technique. The quality of this metamodel will be assessed by comparison with a reference metamodel. This technique is called model updating. Two definitions of an improvement factor will be defined for the two strategies.

In order to build the metamodel using data from partially converged simulations, one must have a tool which is capable of generating a response of the structure over the whole loading interval at a prescribed level of accuracy. Classical incremental algorithms are unsuitable because they work iteratively with successive loading steps and their convergence is prescribed for each loading step instead of globally. Thus, in the case of classical, Newton-type incremental algorithms used in structural analysis, the concept of partially converged calculation is meaningless. Indeed, only the calculation associated with the last loading increment can be partially converged (if the other calculations are not fully converged, there is a high risk of divergence of the algorithm). Therefore, we will rely on the LATIN method [42], which has the advantage of enabling the definition of an approximate solution through a series of iterations over the whole loading interval. A fully converged quantity is a computed quantity whose error indicator (which controls its convergence) falls below a certain reference level. Conversely, a partially converged quantity is a quantity calculated with a higher error level.

Section 2 gives an overview of the LATIN method and presents the error indicator used, which is necessary in order to determine full or partial convergence.

Section 3 presents correlation indices which enable one to quantify the quality of a metamodel with respect to a reference. The evofusion methods used for seeking the zones of interest and for updating are explained. Then, we introduce the expected improvement, which will be used as the enrichment criterion for the evofusion method of seeking the zone of interest.

Finally, Section 2. illustrates the efficiency of the combined use of these main tools (evofusion and the LATIN iterative method) based on two test cases involving contact with friction.

The first idea underlying the LATIN method is domain decomposition, in which the interfaces are mechanical entities in their own right, with their unknowns and constitutive relations. An evolution law is associated with each interface depending on the problem being studied (friction, contact, etc.). The second idea is that the difficulties are separated by considering two sets of equations: the local (possibly nonlinear) equations, and the linear (possibly global) equations.

Considering that the substructures are elastic and that all the nonlinearities are concentrated at the interface, the equations are divided into two groups:
                           
                              •
                              the set 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             A
                                          
                                          
                                             d
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                  of the solutions s
                                 
                                    E
                                  which satisfy the linear equations relative to the substructures, and

the set Γ of the solutions s
                                 
                                    E
                                  which satisfy the local (possibly nonlinear) equations relative to the interface.

Then, the solution of the problem is determined iteratively by seeking successive approximations s which satisfy the two groups of equations alternatively, using search directions E
                        + and E
                        − (Fig. 3
                        ). Thus, the two steps of the iterative algorithm are:

                           A fully converged quantity is an approximate quantity whose estimated error is smaller than a reference value; a partially converged quantity is a quantity whose error is greater than the reference. Thus, the choice of this reference level is important. In our study, the reference levels were set, based on engineering practice, at 1×10−4 for plane or axisymmetric 2D problems and at 1×10−5 for 3D problems.

As shown in Fig. 5
                        , the use of partially converged data can vastly improve computation time. In the example of a shrink disk discussed in Section 4, if T
                        
                           pcv
                         and T
                        
                           fcv
                         denote respectively the computation time of a partially converged quantity and a fully converged quantity, one can have ratios T
                        
                           fcv
                        /T
                        
                           pcv
                         as high as 80, i.e. 80 partially converged quantities can be calculated in the same time as a single fully converged quantity.

In this study, for both strategies, we are interested in the initial correlation between the partially converged metamodel and a reference metamodel. In the case of the metamodel developed for the purpose of finding the minimum, we use the determination coefficient defined by [43] and also used in [41,37]:

                        . This coefficient gives an indication of the shape similarity between the two metamodels. When seeking the minimum, the shape alone is interesting because it enables one to localize the zone of interest.

Conversely, for updating purposes, one needs to have a correlation coefficient which takes into account both the amplitude and the shape of the metamodels. Therefore, one uses the concordance correlation coefficient defined by [44] in the case of two observers for one experiment:

The concept of evofusion was developed in order to be able to use a metamodel to find the global optimum of an objective function [37,41]. This metamodel is a combination of two metamodels, one built using partially converged data and the other using fully converged data. The main idea is that with partially converged data it is possible to obtain the correct shape of the metamodel and, thus, the right tendency [36]. In addition, in our study, the concept of evofusion was used to generate an accurate metamodel throughout the design space. This approach, which is equivalent to global enrichment, is called model updating.

Evofusion is easy to implement (even though there are some subtleties) and it is very effective. Essentially, it consists in correcting a partially converged surrogate model at some specific points in the region of interest using a surrogate model of the error defined between some other partially converged data and fully converged data. Evofusion strategies start with the creation of a first metamodel,

The concept of expected improvement, described in [45,30], is used when a metamodel is constructed by means of a kriging process. Indeed, expected improvement is a statistical approach.

Expected improvement is a probabilistic means of finding the global minimum of a function which is known by means of a metamodel. By definition, the expected improvement is the degree of improvement which one can hope to achieve at a given point. Two aspects are taken into account: one can expect an improvement around a minimum which is known to the metamodel or, on the contrary, in a zone in which only little information is available. Assuming a normal distribution law, one can express the expected improvement as:

                        where Φ is the normal cumulative distribution function and ϕ is the density function. Obviously, when σ
                        =0, there can be no improvement: the calculation is deterministic and, therefore, when a point is calculated, one assumes that the value obtained is the right one (See Fig. 7
                        ).
                           Remark 1
                           More recent works ([46]) have shown that one can assign weights to the known minimum and to the unexplored area. The first term of the expected improvement favors the search around a known calculated minimum, whereas the second term favors the unexplored area. The weighted expected improvement can be expressed as:

The difference between the expected improvement and the weighted expected improvement is illustrated in Fig. 8
                               with ω
                              =0.2.

One can clearly see that for the second iteration more importance was given to the unexplored area. Throughout our work, we used ω
                              =0.2.


                        [41] describes a reinforcement learning algorithm [47] which leads to the most appropriate value of ω for each iteration. An illustration of our complete algorithm is presented on Fig. 9
                        .

We addressed two examples. The first example is an academic problem. The second example is analogous to an industrial case. Both problems involve contact with friction, the objective being to minimize the norm of a function. In both cases, we constructed a metamodel to seek the zone of interest (which contains the minimum of the function) and updated the partially converged metamodel. Studies were carried out for several numbers of initial points, several error levels and different draws. In seeking the minimum, the algorithm was stopped when the minimum of the evofused metamodel fell between 0±1% of the target. When updating a partially converged metamodel, the algorithm was stopped when a correlation criterion greater than 0.95 was attained with respect to a reference metamodel.

The problem consists in finding the reaction load of a cube (Str2) against a wall. F(x) is the reaction force of the wall on the cube (see Fig. 10
                        ).

This is a three-parameter problem: (see Table 1
                        )

Regarding the construction of the metamodel used to localize the zone of interest, we tried to solve:
                           
                              (22)

                                 )

Concerning the strategy for updating the metamodel with respect to a reference, the reference was chosen to be a metamodel representing F(x) very accurately.

As mentioned above, this is a three-parameter problem in the design space. This problem was studied for values of the error indicator ranging from 9×10−2 to 1×10−2 in steps of 1×10−2 and with 8 to 16 initial points per design space dimension. The definition used here for “per dimension” is based on the principle described by [30] where Number of initial points
                           =
                           n
                           ×
                           p with p the dimension of the problem and here n
                           ∈[8,16], n being the number of point per dimension. In this example we will use (8–16) × 3 initials points. The calculations were carried out for 20 different initial draws. We present the gains obtained using the evofusion strategy and a classical enrichment strategy based on the expected improvement with a fully converged metamodel of 10 points per dimension for the same 20 draws. We used this number of initial points as suggested by [30]. Therefore, the gain which is presented is the average over the 20 draws of all the gains obtained from the pair (number of initial points;error). Concerning evofusion, let

                            are plotted in Fig. 11
                           . Based on these results, our first remark is that, on the average, the evofusion method is a winning strategy in terms of time gain. One can observe that for error levels ranging from 8×10−2 to 5×10−2 it leads to higher gains of up to 6. The optimum number of points seems to be 10 and 11 per dimension. This is consistent with what can be found in the literature, and especially with the works presented in [37] for which, for a 2D example, 26 initial points were used. (See Fig. 12
                           ).

It is also attractive to compare these ranges of time gains with the initial correlation between the partially converged initial metamodels and a reference metamodel using the determination coefficient defined by Eq. (16).

Indeed, one can see that a high-correlation zone exists for an error level ranging from 8×10−2 to 5×10−2.

In conclusion, this example demonstrates the interest of the evofusion strategy, which leads to gains in the order of 6 with 10 points per dimension and an error level ranging from 8×10−2 to 5×10−2, regardless of the draw (because the zone is robust).

For the area of interest (error between 8×10−2 and 5×10−2) and for one calculation, the gain of time between one fully converged data and partially converged data is around 10 (time to compute one fully converged data
                           =6.5s, time to compute one partially converged data for an error indicator of 5×10−2 = 0.6s). When using the traditional method (fully converged data+weighted expected improvement), around 7 points are necessary to reach the stopping criterion (these 7 points are added to the first 30 used to create the metamodel to have the global cost of the method), while with the evofusion 15 fully converged points are necessary. However an important gain of time can be reached thanks to this method.

We can notice that a high gain of time may be related to the converged data being too precise (the global LATIN error indicator is too low, same results could be obtained with a higher value of this indicator). Two other tests were performed with different levels of error indicator which give results with good precision. The first one was performed for an error indicator of 5×10−4. The results show a gain of time of 2.5 in the area of interest. The other test was performed for a level of error of 1×10−3 (the precision is still sufficient for this rather simple example: based on our experience, this value is not acceptable for more complex contact with friction problems). Of course, the gain of time is less interesting than previously because it is around 2 but the method is still a winning process. We would like to draw the reader’s attention on the fact that using an initial error as the same used here could be deceptive because the optimum obtained with partially converged simulation will be far away from the true optimum. We illustrate this principle on a 2 parameters example, to do this we set Cf
                              Str2/Str4
                           =0. We can see on Fig. 13
                            that the areas where the optima are located are completely different: Two valleys with Cf
                           
                              Str2/Str3
                           ≃0.2 and J2≃0.03 for the reference, and one point with Cf
                           
                              Str2/Str3
                           ≃0.5 and J2≃−0.01 for partially converged data.

Using the same initial draws, we updated the metamodel based on another reference metamodel. The gain was defined as the computation time for updating the metamodel divided by the computation time of the reference. Thus, the gain which is presented is the average of the 20 gains observed. In order to determine the quality of the metamodel updating, we used a correlation coefficient defined using Eq. (17).

The updating was stopped when the concordance coefficient r
                           
                              ccc
                            became greater than 0.95 (see Fig. 14
                           ).

Once again, one can observe that the optimum model updating zone corresponds to the error zone ranging from 8×10−2 to 5×10−2. This zone is also robust. It corresponds to a zone of high initial correlation. The other zone, from 4×10−2 to 2×10−2, is less interesting and leads to lesser gains. The 1×10−2 error range is slightly less attractive than the first one for which the initial correlation is better. It is remarkable to note that by using again 10 points per dimension and the error level ranging from 8×10−2 to 5×10−2 one obtains high gains irrespective of the draw. (See Fig. 15
                           ).

A shrink disk (Fig. 16
                        ) is a technological component which consists of a biconical inner ring fitted to the pinion and two external conical pressure flanges, one of which is threaded. A clamping load is applied between the external flanges through a series of screws distributed along the circumference. The tightening of the screws presses the conical surfaces against each other and generates radial forces which create the adhesion binding which is necessary to transmit the torque M

The problem being studied has 5 parameters. We studied it for initial errors ranging from 7×10−2 to 1×10−2 using between 8 and 16 initial points per dimension and 10 different initial draws. We call 8–16 points per dimension the fact that we use (8–16) × 5 initials points. The gain was defined as in Eq. (23). Here a fully converged data is computed for a level of error of 1×10−5 and the gain of time between a partially and fully converged data is around 70 (time to compute one fully converged data
                           =42s, time to compute one partially converged data for an error indicator of 5
                           ×
                           10
                           −2
                           
                           =0.6s).

Again, one can observe that the zone which corresponds to an error level ranging from 7×10−2 to 5×10−2 takes the lead with a number of initial points per dimension equal to 10. In addition, this zone is robust (see Fig. 17
                           ).

However, one should note that this initial error range is not well-correlated with the reference model, as can be seen in Fig. 18
                           .

Nevertheless, one can see that for a number of points per dimension ranging between 10 and 14 and an initial error level of 1×10−2 significant gains were achieved. This shows again that a good initial correlation favors high gains. For each strategy around 10 points are added to reach the stopping criterion.

The partially converged metamodel was updated based on the reference metamodel. Only a few points (at least 12, but no more than 14) were necessary to carry out the updating. Consequently, the time gain was almost uniformly distributed. The good results for the error zone 7×10−2 to 4×10−2 (despite the poor initial correlation) can be attributed to the fact that only a few points were necessary to obtain a correct metamodel. Indeed, the metamodel representing the function of interest is an approximation through several planes (due to contact and friction); so only a few evaluations were needed to describe the function of interest correctly (see Fig. 19
                           ).

One can observe that high gains (in the order of 140) were achieved with a certain robustness (i.e. little variability). Therefore, the strategy seems to be very attractive in our two sample cases because it leads to high and stable gains. This leads up to a new approach to the development of metamodels.

In these two examples, the global minimum is in a valley, there is no real minima but there is a lot of plateaux which makes a direct optimization method not adapted.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We showed that the use of partially converged data can lead to drastic time gains (in the order of 10 when searching for the optimal zone). We were able to identify a number of points per dimension (10) and an error level (between 7×10−2 and 5×10−2) which lead to optimum gains. The remarkable fact is that the number of points per dimension and the error range are the same whether one is seeking the zone of interest or updating the metamodel. We found that 10 points per dimension was an attractive solution. This result agrees with that found in [37], where 26 initial points were used for a 2-parameter problem. It also follows the empirical rule given by [30], which states that for an EGO-type optimization study one should use 10 points per dimension.

Regarding the updating strategy, the algorithm is stopped when the correlation with respect to a reference becomes sufficient. However, this reference is not supposed to be known by the engineer, so another stopping criterion (e.g. the number of added points) must be found. Similarly, concerning the stopping criterion of the strategy for locating the zone of interest, one does not check whether the minimum of the evofused metamodel lies in the 0±1% zone. An additional control loop should be envisaged. In our sample cases, the final accuracy with respect to the target was about 10 %. For the examples presented in this paper, there is no real local minima. In a case where numerous local minima exist, we think that it would be good to use the updating strategy to have quickly a relatively good precision, then search the global minimum with the evofusion. This proposition will be tested in a future work.

This, however, does not contradict the fact that high gains can be achieved. It seems that zones with high initial correlation are very interesting for this purpose, but when problems evolve slowly and smoothly, as in the case of the shrink disk, this is not a necessary condition. A challenging question would be to determine these zones in the case where our criterion of 10 initial points per dimension for an error level between 7×10−2 and 5×10−2 is not satisfied. [37,41] propose a solution which consists in observing the evolution of the partially converged metamodels and stopping the search once a correlation criterion between the last metamodels has been reached. One should also consider the study of 3D problems, in which high gains can be expected.
