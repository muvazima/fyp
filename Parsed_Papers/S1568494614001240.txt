               Abstract
               
                  To the best of our knowledge, there is no method in the literature to find the fuzzy optimal solution of fully fuzzy critical path (FFCP) problems i.e., critical path problems in which all the parameters are represented by LR flat fuzzy numbers. In this paper, a new method is proposed for the same. Also, it is shown that it is better to use JMD representation of LR flat fuzzy numbers in the proposed method as compared to the other representation of LR flat fuzzy numbers.
