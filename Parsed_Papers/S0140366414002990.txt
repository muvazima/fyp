                  Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) will play an important role in Smart Cities and will support the development of not only safety applications, but also car smart video surveillance services. Recent improvements in multimedia over VANETs allow drivers, passengers, and rescue teams to capture, share, and access on-road multimedia services. Vehicles can cooperate with each other to transmit live flows of traffic accidents or disasters and provide drivers, passengers, and rescue teams rich visual information about a monitored area. Since humans will watch the videos, their distribution must be done by considering the provided Quality of Experience (QoE) even in multi-hop, multi-path, and dynamic environments. This article introduces an application framework to handle this kind of services and a routing protocol, the DBD (Distributed Beaconless Dissemination), that enhances the dissemination of live video flows on multimedia highway VANETs. DBD uses a backbone-based approach to create and maintain persistent and high quality routes during the video delivery in opportunistic Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) scenarios. It also improves the performance of the IEEE 802.11p MAC layer, by solving the Spurious Forwarding (SF) problem, while increasing the packet delivery ratio and reducing the forwarding delay. Performance evaluation results show the benefits of DBD compared to existing works in forwarding videos over VANETs, where main objective and subjective QoE results are measured.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Safety and video surveillance car applications are key Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) services for smart city scenarios and have been attracting an important attention from governments, car manufacturers, academia, and society [1]. Nowadays, the distribution of real-time multimedia content over Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) is becoming a reality and allowing drivers/passengers to have new experiences with on-road videos in a smart city [2,3]. According to Cisco, video traffic will represent over 90% of the global IP data in a few years, where thousands of users will produce, share, and consume multimedia services ubiquitously, including in their vehicles.

Multimedia VANETs are well-suited for capturing and sharing environmental monitoring, surveillance, traffic accidents, and disaster-based video smart city applications. Live streaming video flows provide users and authorities (e.g., first responder teams and paramedics) with more precise information than simple text messages and allow them to determine a suitable action, while reducing human reaction times [4]. Vehicles can cooperate with each other to disseminate short videos of dangerous situations to visually inform drivers and rescue teams about them both in the city and on a highway.

The perception of videos shared and watched by humans, characterized in terms of Quality of Experience (QoE), is directly measured by the acceptability of the users and is related to, but differs from the extensively studied concept Quality of Service (QoS) [5]. QoS-based approaches and metrics, such as the ones based on link/network-related parameters (packet loss, packet delay, and/or Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)) fail to capture subjective aspects of video content related to human visual system as expected for human-centric environments. Therefore, QoE objective and subjective metrics, such as Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Mean Opinion Score (MOS) must be used to measure the video quality level from the user point-of-view [6].

The broadcast nature of vehicular communications brings many technical challenges to the delivery of real-time video flows in VANETs with QoE support. The distribution of live video sequences (from seconds to minutes) with QoE assurance in a VANET is strongly influenced by forwarding schemes, especially in long distance transmissions where, for instance, there are no emergency vehicles in the surroundings and multi-hop V2V communications are required. The destination vehicle(s) can be placed kilometers away from the source and expects to receive on-line video sequences with a good quality level through V2V forwarding schemes.

Several forwarding solutions have been proposed in the literature for VANETs [7]. A contention-based forwarding is a well-accepted approach for forwarding data in dynamic multimedia VANETs, where end-to-end routes may not exist at anytime [8]. Opportunistic schemes decide the next-hop forwarder based on a distribution contention phase and with an extra delay; reactive solutions create and maintain a route on-demand, but they are not easily adaptable to geo-cast routing. Proactive solutions define the relay nodes before the content transmission, which is not suitable for dynamic scenarios, like cities. To improve the system performance and video quality level, an opportunistic and beaconless geographic routing protocol is required, in order to create and maintain a high quality backbone for video flows, while increasing the packet delivery ratio, reacting well to dynamic environments or node failures, and avoiding the Spurious Forwarding (SF) problem [9]: this is an issue that because of time-contingent transmissions may erroneously stop the packet propagation, affecting the packet delivery ratio, more and more as the bit rate raises.

This article presents a protocol for real-time video dissemination on multimedia highway VANETs, called DBD (Distributed Beaconless Dissemination), together with an application framework that allows vehicles to seamlessly share videos (e.g., danger situations, disasters, or surveillance smart city applications) with other peers in a multi-path fashion and with QoE assurance. Our proposed protocol creates V2V backbones for fast video packet relaying, thus increasing the packet delivery ratio, reducing the forwarding delay caused by the contention phase of reactive/opportunistic geographic routing schemes, and enhancing the user experience when watching live video flows. At the same time, it also aims to improve the IEEE 802.11p MAC (Medium Access Control) layer utilization to solve the SF problem.

The proposed solution improves the transmission of live on-road videos for medium-long distances as required for disaster, surveillance, and even for many entertainment multimedia smart city services. The benefits of DBD compared to existing works in forwarding video flows in urban highway infrastructureless VANETs are demonstrated with the aid of simulation and real QoE experiments, where main objective and subjective QoE results are presented, namely SSIM, PSNR, and MOS. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to evaluate a routing scheme for live video streaming in VANETs with real MOS experiments.

The remainder of the article is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the related works; our proposal is explained in Section 3, together with details about the SF problem. Section 4 presents the test environment, scenario, implementations, and simulation results. The conclusion and future work are described in Section 5.

@&#RELATED WORKS@&#

This section presents the main routing approaches for transmitting video flows in VANETs available in the literature. It is important not only to propose new video-based routing schemes, but also to evaluate their performance based on QoE metrics.

There are many ways to route a packet: one is proactively building a route, before needed, and constantly keeping it updated or another one is to choose the forwarder nodes reactively (which means when you need a route in a specific geographic direction, a route is built on-demand and only later packets are transmitted) or, as a last resort, you can choose forwarder nodes in the very same moment you start transmitting the first packet towards a specific geographic direction. From the first to the last approach, respectively, the required maintenance is always less, but the protocols are lighter and better standing the dynamic environment of a vehicular network. For this reason, generally, proactive solutions are not used in VANETs, especially for multimedia transmission, so we will focus on the other approaches.

The last approach, the opportunistic one, may be one of the best choices in VANETs. This kind of solutions decides the next-hop relay through a distributed contention phase, where an extra delay is introduced to decide the best forwarder vehicle. In this scenario, a backbone-based approach is required to cut these hop-by-hop and packet-by-packet delays for delivering short or long video sequences.

An example of an opportunistic routing approach is proposed in [10], where the next-hop is chosen in the same direction with respect to the sender and a path is created towards the destination by exchanging beacons with a delay based logic, with results slightly better than a random algorithm. Additionally, VANET routing schemes should also be developed taking into account the SF problem for better performance. Finally, the impact of the proposed solution on the video quality level must be measured by advanced QoE metrics (e.g., SSIM and MOS) and not only by the PSNR as presented in [10], which does not perfectly correlate with a perceived visual quality due to the non-linear behavior of the human visual system.

An example of approach to reactively deliver video sequences in VANETs, based on overlay networks is provided in [11], where the authors build redundant transmission trees, although the topology is highly dynamic. This proposal is difficult to implement in opportunistic and dynamic VANET environments: stability and availability of communication links over time are critical issues when dealing with real-time multimedia applications and they become much more challenging when coupled with vehicular mobility and frequent lane changes. Besides the overhead required for maintaining the overlay networks, the maximum bit rate considered is still somehow low for multimedia transmissions and the simulation study only takes into account a small amount of nodes (small-scale scenario). Furthermore, QoE experiments are needed to show the benefits of the proposed solution in disseminating videos according to the human point-of-view.

An interesting study on video dissemination in VANETs was performed in [12]. The authors use several VANET approaches and compare them, like delay-based and network coding techniques, mixed with probability, trying to minimize the number of forwarding nodes and the final packet loss; still when the data rate increases, performance gets worst. Since the authors are discussing the performance evaluation of VANET protocols for video delivery, they should have also included QoE results into the paper.

A key requirement for multimedia content dissemination in VANETs is to build a dynamic backbone of relay nodes, especially for delivering live video sequences of a monitored area (e.g., the duration varies from seconds to minutes). In [13], the authors propose an opportunistic backbone-based geographic routing scheme for V2V video transmissions by using a Bayesian model for predicting where vehicles are going to be, so they can build the backbone by also considering such predictions. The relay node election is performed according to a delay-based fashion and, in order to tackle the broadcast storm problem [14], an additional safety delay is allowed. The idea is promising as a concept, but high data rates still results in a considerable degree of loss and decrease the video quality level.

Another backbone-based hybrid geographic routing for video sharing in VANET is presented in [8]. The authors aim to build a backbone and they include several features in their design: the backbone is opportunistic, delay-based and it keeps into account the vehicles speed and direction in order to keep the backbone operative as long as possible. Also this approach uses beacons and ACKs. The authors provide several evaluation scenarios (traffic safety, video transmission, and audio streaming), so the study is interesting, but also in this case, the protocol requires beacons and general overhead messages to work. The main weakness of the current backbone-based routing protocols is that they do not consider the SF problem in their decision schemes, as well as they do not evaluate the quality level of the delivered videos based on QoE metrics.

Besides the classic approaches, also game theory-based VANET schemes for video dissemination were proposed to optimize the content distribution, for example through coalition formation algorithms, like in [15]. The nodes tend to form coalitions so that their individual profits are maximized and they distribute the contents to all the nodes in their coalition, without using the classic routing approaches for routes construction: every node shares pieces of information. The logic of the proposed solution is promising, but the considered scenario only deals with a limited number of nodes and without any QoE assessment procedures.

A different approach for video delivery in VANETs is considering heterogeneous networks, as proposed in [16], where the interaction among cellular and IEEE 802.11 technology is studied. This solution only considers infrastructured scenarios, so that nodes have to be associated to the APs (Access Points), which is a costly operation in terms of time and money, so the architecture only works at low speeds and requires extra devices (APs and Antennas) in V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) VANET scenarios.

One of the main differences among our protocol and the ones above is the better use of beacons: our approach provides all the needed information in the sent packets and no extra overhead packets must be generated to establish a backbone, to maintain it or even to recover from failures. Another important difference is at the MAC layer. Many protocols have high failure rate when bit rate increases, because they are prone to the SF problem, introduced in [9], that our solution tackles and solves, so that higher rates can be supported with lower loss ratios. One more relevant difference is the ROI (Region Of Interest): in our study, it is much wider than in the other works, really pushing multi-hop for longer distances (usually 3–4 times bigger than the longest distances declared in the papers cited above) as required in many rescue/disaster VANET scenarios: we can achieve that thanks to the SF elimination, since normally this problem introduces a certain probability of dissemination interruption (see Section 3.2). Moreover, we also provide large scenarios in terms of number of vehicles and the distance between the source and the destination nodes.

Most of the proposed routing schemes use beacons or additional overhead messages for signaling, as a way to find relay nodes or create backbones to deliver video packets. The next-hop selection process can be achieved, in most cases, through delay based logics, but also through probabilistic or topology-based ones, as explained in [17]. As the focus of this article is on infrastructureless traffic, only distributed logics were taken into account. Last but not least, the video dissemination over a VANET is mostly generally explored through the standard network/packet metrics, without using good QoE metrics, as will be done in this article.

This section introduces our application framework and the DBD routing protocol, to improve on-road live video distributions in multi-hop VANETs. DBD uses a backbone-based approach to create persistent and high quality routes for video delivery in dynamic smart city environments. It also improves the interaction with the IEEE 802.11p MAC layer to solve the Spurious Forwarding problem and the usage of wireless resources. Examples of live videos for VANETs include video surveillance, disaster/accident scenes, and entertainment applications, where humans are going to watch the content and QoE-guarantees must be assured.

Here is how our framework works in a smart city scenario: by looking at Fig. 1
                     , when an accident occurs, a safety alert message (the red
                        1
                        For interpretation of color in Fig. 1, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.
                     
                     
                        1
                      one) is propagated through multi-hop communications. Since the message is geo-tagged, our application lets the cars receiving the message directly (e.g., one hop distance) or the ones that find themselves near the source vehicle (yet at a safe distance) automatically switch their cameras on (in some cases, the cameras are already on and recording the area, but not sharing yet) and start recording the video of the situation. The final aim is to share the content with their peers/interested vehicles that can be situated some km away. Another example is present in [18], where an automotive radar in a vehicle can detect a danger situation and triggers the video camera to share the video with interested peers on the road.

The video streaming is provided on-demand when the emergency vehicle 
                        
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 ∊
                              
                           
                        
                      transmits a request for the video of the accident scene (green message); the nodes one hop away from the affected zone are prompted to send their videos of the accident. These vehicles are clearly still, now, so by looking at their own video, the drivers that think they have a good angle, push a button to enable sharing to legitimate requests on a dedicated sub-channel of the spectrum (yellow message), as explained in Section 3.3. The first message of this flow inhibits possible other video providers.

It is important to underline that in a shock situation caused by the accident, the driver only needs to push one button. He/she does not really have to activate anything, nor answer calls. Most important, he/she does not need any LTE coverage (in many rural roads and highway scenarios, LTE is not fully available yet) and incurs no fee for DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communications) usage. Hence, this framework can be defined as automated, which means that user has not to perform any complex operation or activate any specific device (the On-Board Unit, OBU, is always on for safety reasons, of course) to make the system work properly.

This framework can be used together with other smart city traffic-related services that are nowadays available, like waze [19], and interactions among them can be put in place. Contrary to our proposed framework, applications like waze are active services, i.e., the user has to perform some operations to report the current situation and to get a feedback from the application.

By coupling active and passive services, more and more information can be shared, and more and more accuracy can be achieved. By exploiting fixed infrastructure, long distance transmissions can also be supported, if there are no emergency vehicles in the surroundings: RSUs (Road Side Unit) located at strategic places (e.g., gas stations, big intersections) can collect the video and send it farther away, like traditional cellular communications can also do.

Our proposal not only deals with the application layer, but also with the lower layers, implementing a smart dissemination solution and dealing with the lower layers of the transmission stack. The paradigm of the application is intentionally generic: it ideally provides one video source (but potentially there may be more than one) and as many destination as needed on a highway-like scenario on specific sub-channels. The number of destinations does not really overload the network, since the transmission paradigm is broadcast and it exploits the multi-hop capability of the DSRC standard.

In particular, when the safety DSRC message is broadcasted (immediately after the occurred accident, red message in Fig. 1), the interested node (the ambulance) replies with his video request (green message), that also travels via broadcast messages. Also these messages are forwarded by nodes towards the direction of the accident, not further on, and above all, not in other directions, since in every message the GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates of the source, destination and last hop are enclosed. With the same principle, the video is then forwarded from the source to the requester (yellow message). Our proposal can also be easily supported together with VANET ICN (Information Centric Networking) systems [5], where an event is announced and the requesting nodes ask for the content (Interest video flows).

Before considering how to disseminate video contents, we analyse what happens when dealing with the MAC protocol and distributed relay node picking through delay or probabilistic logics.

Most of the dissemination routing logics, in fact, without studying what happens at the lower layers, experience the Spurious Forwarding (SF) problem [9]. In order to explain this phenomenon, it is important to define a basic mechanism of the dissemination protocols (also common to other protocols described in Section 2): Inhibition Rule (IR). Essentially, when a node receives a message with a sequence number s for the first time, it starts its forwarding decision process and decides whether to schedule the forwarding operation or not; if in the meantime it receives another copy of the message with the same sequence number s, then it understands that there is another node that already forwarded the packet (maybe because it is in a better position, such as in the delay-based approach or simply because it was faster) and inhibits itself from forwarding the message. This is the basic mechanism to avoid the broadcast storm problem [14].

There are implications with respect to the MAC layer, though, that may lead to an undesired incorrect behavior, the SF problem. Let us consider a tagged node forwarding a message with sequence number s. Fig. 2
                         illustrates an example, where the tagged vehicle is denoted with A. Vehicles within the radio coverage of A successfully receive the message, hence they schedule message forwarding according to the rules of the routing protocol. Let 
                           
                              F
                           
                         denote the set of such vehicles.

In an ideal dissemination routing protocol, only a single vehicle out of 
                           
                              F
                           
                         will eventually forward the message and in doing so, it will inhibit all the other ones. The IR forbids sending a message if the node has already received at least two copies of that message with the same sequence number.

In practice, message forwarding takes place when the routing entity invokes the lower layer MAC entity and requests sending the message. The MAC layer entity takes a non-null time to deliver the frame containing the routing layer message over the wireless medium to other nearby vehicles. During that time there is no inhibition acting, so other vehicles can well decide to forward the same message number s themselves at routing layer. This does not necessarily cause collisions at MAC layer, but it entails that message s gets forwarded by more than one node belonging to 
                           
                              F
                           
                        . In the example of Fig. 2 both B and W could decide forwarding, if those decisions are taken by the respective routing entities with a time difference less than the MAC frame delivery time. Assume W forwards the message s first and soon after B forwards the message as well, which means it requests its MAC layer entity to send it on the wireless channel. Once B receives the message forwarded by W, it is too late to recall the message from the MAC layer, so also the second, duplicate forwarding will take place. For delay-based dissemination routing protocols, where the optimal forwarder is chosen after throwing a timer upon the packet’s reception, proportional to the distance to the sender, this critical situation occurs whenever the difference between the timer values of the forwarding vehicles is smaller than the MAC service time.

If messages are issued well separated in time, so that each message propagates through the vehicles on the road without interacting with previous and subsequent messages, then the MAC service time is on average equal to a minimum constant value

SF has two effects: it stops the message propagation due to the IR, since vehicles that receive both the first forwarded message and the subsequent spuriously forwarded messages will apply the IR. Since they have seen more than a single reception of messages with the same sequence number, they are inhibited and stop the forwarding chain. The propagation interruption can be avoided by means of a hop count field in the message header, although the duplicate forwarding processes will continue to take place. If A forwards a message with hop count h, nodes 
                           
                              B

                         and any other node in the set 
                           
                              F
                           
                         will schedule its forwarding with hop count 
                           
                              h
                              +
                              1
                           
                        . A vehicle with a scheduled message having sequence number s and hop count 
                           
                              h
                              +
                              1
                           
                        , upon reception of a message, checks whether it has the same sequence number s. In that case, the newly received message is considered a duplicate only if it has also hop count equal to 
                           
                              h
                              +
                              1
                           
                        . In that case, the node drops its copy of the message and applies the IR. If instead, the received message has sequence number s, but hop count h, that one is not considered as a duplicate and it does not trigger the IR, since it is from a spurious forwarder of the previous hop zone.

A second effect of spurious forwarding is an increase of traffic load on the MAC interface, since more transmitters than strictly needed for dissemination are activated and join the competition for the medium. Since this overload increases the MAC delay, there arises an avalanche effect, where increasing delays trigger more SFs, that increase the overload further. This is especially true for delay based dissemination routing protocols. It is important to note that introducing a hop count does not solve the overload at high data rate.

                        ), but at routing layer we must make sure that packets belonging to every kind propagate in the right direction by minimizing the transmitting nodes. Our proposed geographic and opportunistic protocol, Distributed Backbone Dissemination (DBD), was designed with that purpose: it builds a distributed backbone, without any beacon message needed, any external knowledge (maps, crossroads, etc.), any particular configuration and no RSU presence for many km (up to 8km, as shown in Section 4). The backbone network, composed of Backbone Nodes (BNs) is totally self-organized and self-adjustable, without the need of dedicated control messages.

The message relaying is based on a delay logic; when a node receives a message, it starts a timer, IR aware (once a node receives the second copy of the same packet, it inhibits itself from forwarding it):

When the node W wins the forwarding contention (because of its shortest timer), it understands it is in the best position to forward messages (close to A’s coverage limit), so it elects itself as BN, i.e., it becomes the default relay node of its neighborhood. This is obtained by having the BN set its timer to 0, so when it receives a message, it instantly forwards it, thus inhibiting all nearby nodes. This situation persists until the BN’s distance s from the sender is such that

Once a node is elected as BN, it also transmits all the messages backlogged in its buffer, since their timer is still running. This happens since the BN has just won a contention, then it is in the best position to forward messages, so there is no reason to lose time waiting its other backlogged distance-based timers to elapse.

If the BN, say W, experiences a failure or moves out of range, since the other nodes keep their timers running, eventually one of the timers will elapse, thus automatically electing a new BN within a time at most

                                       max
                                    
                                 
                              
                           .

By looking at Fig. 2, if A sends a message and there are not already elected BNs, since B and W are too close to each other, they will both forward the message (see Section 3.2). The first to do so will be W (the farthest one, in accordance with Eq. (1)), then because of spurious forwarding, B will do it, too. Both B and W receive the message copies they have forwarded, carrying the same hop count value. Then, DBD rule envisages that they must check their distance with respect to the sender A, so they autonomously consider themselves not BN, if their distance from A is less than the one in the message they received.

In our example, A’s position is locally recorded in receivers’ message list, while in 
                              
                                 W
                                 ,
                                 B
                              
                           ’s position is in the header of the message it just received (the one that triggered W’s spurious forwarding check), so W can compare the distances from A to W and from A to B, thus verifying it is the BN. The spurious forwarder B, after its message’s delivery to MAC (during W’s transmission that occupies MAC), completes the reception of W’s message with the same sequence number and hop count from a node different from itself, so it sets itself as non BN. The same principles apply when multiple spurious forwarders are involved. Besides the hop count introduction that avoids dissemination interruption, this solution eliminates the problem and allows higher rates transmission, because the channel is not uselessly overleaded (see Section 3.2).

In order to keep the backbone in place as long as possible, it is better to choose the backbone nodes travelling in the same direction. This allows to keep the inter-vehicle distances within the 
                              
                                 α
                              
                            threshold, so that it happens less frequently that a hop must be re-elected, maybe just because that specific hop was travelling in the wrong direction, thus it went out of the forwarding zone too fast. The direction is recognized by simply comparing the node’s previous position and the current one (this happens for every packet reception or every 15s, whatever comes first).

In urban scenarios (not simple highways), there could be loops that hop count solves, even if it can take several unnecessary forwarding operations; in fact, let h be the last hop count number received for a given message with sequence number s. Let 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       h
                                    
                                    
                                       new
                                    
                                 
                              
                            be the hop count carried by a second received copy of the message with sequence number s. The IR is triggered and both copies of the message are no more considered for forwarding if 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       h
                                    
                                    
                                       new
                                    
                                 
                                 <

                           , where 
                              
                                 γ
                              
                            is a constant greater than zero, empirically setted equal to 3. This means that 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       h
                                    
                                    
                                       new
                                    
                                 
                              
                            is smaller than h, but since it arrived later, then it does not come from the preceding hop vehicles, but it is due to a loop. This is, in fact, the logic that applies to a circular ring road, where at a certain point, if the packets are generated from a source and travel in both directions, then when they meet after half a ring, this logic avoids unnecessary forwarding operations.

In order to understand the whole process and how the algorithm behaves, we can follow the activity diagram of the algorithm in Fig. 3
                           . We see that upon the reception of a packet which is carrying a specific sequence number s, if it was never completely processed before (that means that the node has never ended the process with a decision about s yet), then its propagation direction is checked (as explained in Section 3.1) and if it is not ok, the algorithm ends. At this point, if the message with seqnum s has never been seen before, then the node checks if it is a BN (backbone management activity in Fig. 3). If it is not the case, then three things may happen:
                              
                                 1.
                                 The node already has information about this sequence number s, so it checks the packet’s Hop Count (HC) field: if it is much greater than the one it has in memory (
                                       
                                          
                                             
                                                h
                                             
                                             
                                                new
                                             
                                          
                                          ⩾
                                          h
                                          +
                                          γ
                                       
                                    ), this means that there is somebody past him that already processed and sent the very same message it is still processing, so the present node must not consider itself as a BN (safety condition) and ends the processing.

The HC is less than the one in memory (
                                       
                                          
                                             
                                                h
                                             
                                             
                                                new
                                             
                                          
                                          <
                                          h
                                       
                                    ), then it is a packet that went through a different path and came back (or it is just an occasional spurious forwarder), so the node drops it. This rule thus covers both SF elimination and loop protection.

If the HC is s.t. 
                                       
                                          h
                                          ⩽
                                          
                                             
                                                h
                                             
                                             
                                                new
                                             
                                          
                                          <
                                          h
                                          +
                                          γ
                                       
                                    , then the current node continues the processing, because this may be a spurious forwarder, so standard IR does not apply here and the SF elimination check applies, instead: the best BN must be found.

In case it is a BN or after the above phase, it checks if it is at the correct distance from the previous hop to still be a BN, otherwise it de-elects itself and reverts to the contention phase, by starting a timer, as if it was not a BN at all (schedule forwarding activity in Fig. 3). In this phase, when the timer elapses, if the node has not been receiving any other copy of this s, this means that it is the one in the best position (thus with the shortest timer) to be a BN, so it elects as one and completes the sending operation of the current s, plus all the other enqueued messages waiting for their timer to elapse.

The main objective of this performance evaluation analysis is to measure the quality level of live video flows in urban highway VANETs by comparing several key routing proposals, namely DBD, DBF (Delay Based Forwarding) [20], PBF (Probability Based Forwarding) [21], and RND (Random Forwarding) [22].

To highlight the benefits of DBD in disseminating live video flows, while maintaining a high quality backbone, a comparison with the three above protocols is done. The aim is to cover the major node selection strategies, all of them providing IR, with a distributed beaconless approach, based on a timer or a probability started upon the reception of the first copy of a message.

All the protocols have been improved with respect to their original versions, so they are aware of the desired message propagation direction and exploit it for the forwarding strategy; moreover we needed to equip all the protocols with a rudimentary mechanism to reduce the forwarding contention timer: once a node successfully transmits a packet in the flow, its timer for the next s will be halved (or probability function doubled-up). We introduced these improvements because the standard protocols, as they were, provided a poor performance and did not represent a real comparison. The PBF, RND, and DBF do not avoid SF problems neither support backbone-based improvements, where the impact of those features in a VANET will be discussed in this section.

The examined protocols are:
                        
                           1.
                           DBF: The farthest away the node, the shortest the timer, according to Eq. (1) 
                              [20].

PBF: The closer the node, the lower the forwarding probability p, namely 
                                 
                                    p
                                    =
                                    d
                                    /
                                    
                                       
                                          R

                              , where d is the distance between sender and receiver [21].

RND: The timer is independent of the positions of the sender and the receiver; it is drawn according to a uniform probability density on the interval 
                                 
                                    [
                                    0

                                    ]
                                 
                               
                              [22].

In order to get realistic scenarios and results, the experiments were carried out by using real Internet-based video sequences, Evalvid Tool [23], and real maps from open street map [24], which were imported into SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) [25], allowing us to generate the desired vehicle flows, with realistic behavior and vehicle-to-vehicle interactions, since a car-following model is implemented, together with random cruise speed and several vehicles classes, selected according to empirical data. To stick to a real situation as much as possible, we imported a portion of the San Diego Freeway map that runs along the UCLA campus in Los Angeles, as shown in Fig. 4
                        . Furthermore, the videos and the road/vehicle characteristics were integrated into Network Simulator 2 (NS2) [26] together with the implementation of the routing protocols. After the simulation process, distorted videos with different networking impairments were used for subjective experiments in a VANET-based video evaluation testbed.

Real-time video sequences consist of one or more media streams with different spatial temporal video activities and features. A Group of Picture (GoP) is a group of successive pictures within a coded video stream and it is composed of a combination of three frame types for the compressed video streams, namely I (Intra-coded), P (Predictive-coded) and B (Bidirectionally predictive-coded) frames as defined in the MPEG standard. The successive frames between two succeeding I frames define a GoP. A GoP pattern is characterized by two parameters as follows: GoP (N,
                        M), where N is the I to I frame distance and M is the I to P frame distance. Notice that there is no fixed default value for the GoP length, but the typical minimum and maximum values for resolution industrial video, such as MPEG-2 videos, are between 10 and 20. The encoding/decoding correlation between the frames, in particular, the B and P frames, depends on the respective preceding and succeeding I or P frames. Therefore, I frames are the most important ones from the human point of view.

The simulator was configured to run 20 simulations representing the most challenging part of the application, which is the live streaming of the video flow

                        , with different scenario conditions: we varied the vehicle density levels on the roads (50, 100, and 200nodes/km), the ROI, and also the included videos (1 per simulation) with different GoP lengths (10, 15, and 18 typical Internet-based videos) in order to get possible results for as many scenarios as possible. The results are presented with a confidence interval of 95%. The key simulation parameters are summarized in Table 1
                        .

Measuring the human experience when watching video sequences is a key requirement for our work. Therefore, in addition to a QoS metric (Packet Delivery Ratio, PDR, which is the ratio between the number of packets correctly received at the destination and the total sent packets), main objective and subjective QoE metrics (including PSNR, SSIM, and MOS) were analyzed in order to show the impact of routing schemes on the user perception in scenarios with different node densities and end-to-end distances. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to evaluate routing protocols for video streaming in VANETs with real MOS experiments.

The SSIM metric is based on a frame-to-frame assessment of three video components, i.e., luminance, contrast, and structural similarity. It ranges from 0 to 1, and a higher SSIM value means better video quality. The PSNR is a traditional objective metric used to measure, in dB, the video quality level based on original and processed video sequences. Typical values for the PSNR in lossy videos are between 30dB and 50dB, the higher the better. We used the MSU Video Quality Measurement Tool (VQMT) to collect the results for the objective QoE metrics.

For the subjective experiments, an Android application [27] was created (following the ITU-R recommendations) to show the videos and collect their MOS values in real environments. We used the Single Stimulus (SS) method of ITU-R BT.500 in the tests and 30 subjects (10 from Brazil, 10 from Italy, and 10 from USA) were invited to participate in the evaluation process. They had normal vision capability and their age ranged from 18 to 40. In the SS studies, the videos were only shown to the observers one at a time. The SS paradigm is ideally suited for experiments with a large number of videos and significantly reduces the amount of time needed to conduct the study compared to a Double Stimulus (DS) scheme. After watching a video, the viewer has up to 10s to assess the video quality level by selecting a score ranging from 1 to 10, where 1 means bad quality and 10 means excellent quality.

The distorted videos were played on a Samsung Galaxy Table 3 8.0 with a

                        . The human behavior when they are evaluating videos, the distractions caused by the surrounding environment, and any other (subjective) psychological factors related to the human psychology are out of the scope of this article. For instance, we will not discuss why observers are quick to criticize and slow to forgive or why they take less time to fall when distortions appear than to rise when distortions disappear.

Regarding the evaluated videos, 9 CIF, MPEG, and 30fps (frame per second) source videos available in [28], including one Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG)-generated and 8 user-generated videos downloaded from Youtube, were transmitted in each scenario. Each selected video was simulated with 3 different GoP lengths (10, 15, and 18) as expected in many internet videos. A total of 540 distorted video sequences were collected from the experiments (i.e., 9 videos×three GoP lengths×20 simulations), where some videos are available in [29]. Since the QoE results of the videos with the 3 GoP lengths (10, 15, and 18) were quite similar, we will just plot the average results for all videos with a GoP of 15. In addition, the videos used in the experiments have on average 33 GoPs. To simplify the visualization of the results, we grouped the video sequences/GoPs in groups of 3 GoPs (11 groups of 3 GoPs).

This section shows the impact of the network on the video delivery with all protocols by measuring the PDR. By looking at Fig. 6
                           , the benefit of creating a backbone is very clear from the behavior of DBD. It is important to notice that these results represent a worst case, with respect to what can generally happen. In our experiments in fact, the flow starts without an already formed backbone, so as it is possible to see, the first GoPs (and thus the first packets) are used by DBD to build the backbone: this is the reason why the performance is not that good at the beginning. In an average case, instead, it is the first safety alert message (red message in Fig. 1) that builds the backbone, in order to avoid the broadcast storm problem.

After creating the backbone, the enqueued packets start to be sent over the established path, without any other delay, and the performance considerably improves by reaching about 100% of delivered packets. The convergence time for this result is about 2–3s on the average. Since we are using dynamic scenarios, at a certain point (starting when the Group of 3 GoPs is 7 on all the three graphics), the backbone loses one or more vehicles (they leave the freeway or their distance with respect to the previous hop is no longer optimal according to the logic defined in Section 3.3), so a new vehicle must be elected. This phase is very tricky, because the backbone self repairs, but in order to do so, a timer must be started to elect the new BN where the previous one failed: this process takes time (in the worst case, which happens when in the next hop region there is only one node and that node is very close to the previous BN, that time is 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       T
                                    
                                    
                                       max
                                    
                                 
                              
                           ), so packets start to pile-up after the last working BN and start to be dropped like in the initial phase until the backbone is fixed.

Depending on the specific traffic load or other conditions that may occur, the temporary diminished performance can cause more or less damage: as it is possible to see in Fig. 6(b), for example, in some of the simulations we had a really bad situation (most likely because of the position of the vehicles, together with a high transmission load when the BN failed), particularly when the Group of 3 GoPs is 7, where we see a very low minimum value, so the damage is higher when counting the average. Nonetheless we have to consider that without using a backbone, in some scenarios, the delivery delay can be over 200ms for DBF/RND (over the packet play-out deadline) and about 100ms for PBF, while by using DBD, we only need about 20ms once the backbone is in place.

The DBF, RND, and PBF protocols, instead, besides an initial phase, keep their performance at a very low PDR value, about 50% or less. Also in this case, the initial phase is when they do not even have the halved timer mechanism we provided for the relay selection (because the principle is similar to the backbone creation case). Without this kind of improvement, the performance would only have gone worst than those initial values.

Besides the DBD improvement because of the backbone utilization, that yields the necessity of such an expedient, it is also clear how the SF problem impacts on the percentage of delivered packets. In fact, as we can see, even the first packets (point number 1 in Fig. 6), where the backbone is still not at its steady state, has a very different PDR from DBD (about 30% less). This happens, as explained in Section 3.2, because of the dissemination interruption that may take place at every hop, especially in very high density scenarios and because of the effect caused by the multiple transmission of the same s in every hop zone, that saturate the channel with an avalanche effect.

Since PDR alone is not enough to measure the quality level of the videos based on the user experience, this section will discuss the performance of each protocol in transmitting live videos under different network conditions, by analyzing PSNR, SSIM, and MOS results. Fig. 7
                           (a) presents the PSNR values for scenarios with different densities, where the inter-distance between source and destination, 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                    
                                       ROI
                                    
                                 
                              
                           , is 4km.


                           Fig. 7(b) shows PSNR results for video transmissions when 
                              
                                 2
                                 ⩽
                                 
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                    
                                       ROI
                                    
                                 
                                 ⩽
                                 4
                                 
                                 km
                              
                           . In all the experiments, the results reveal that DBD aims to keep the PSNR for all video sequences around 34dB, while DBF, PBF, and RND can only assure the delivery of video flows with an average PSNR of 12dB. The DBF performance decreases when the density is 200veh/km, because the interference is high compared to scenarios with 50 and 100veh/km. Before the backbone construction, i.e., during the first 3s of the simulation time, PSNR results when DBD is used, are below 34dB. This happens because DBD requires a couple of seconds to establish and maintain persistent and high quality routes, which reduces the delay for forwarding packets, collisions, and SF errors.

After the dissemination backbone is in place, the average PSNR reaches 42dB, while DBF, PBF, and RND still keep the PSNR values below 15dB. Videos with PSNR results over 35dB are considered good or excellent from the user point-of-view, but they are scored as bad when the values are below 20dB. When the DBD backbone is created, only 3% of all video I frames were lost, especially when the group of 3 GoPs is 7, due to the selection of new relay nodes to forward the video flows. It is possible to reconstruct the video sequences on the receiver side even when B and some P-frames are lost, but almost 60% of I frames are lost when DBF, PBF, and RND are responsible for routing packets. Without an I frame, the entire GoP cannot be decoded and the error propagates until the beginning of the next GoP, upon the reception of a new I frame.

The SSIM metric improves the traditional PSNR by measuring the video frames based on their luminance similarity, contrast similarity, and structural similarity. Fig. 8
                            demonstrates the average SSIM of all protocols, for scenarios with different densities and 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                    
                                       ROI
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 4
                                 
                                 km
                              
                           , and during the entire video transmissions (videos are grouped in GoP of 3 to simplify their visualization of the results).

The SSIM results reveal that DBD transmits live video sequences with a good or excellent quality level, where the average SSIM for all scenarios is 0.91. This means that the decoded videos have a high correlation with the original video flows. Before establishing a stable backbone, 10% of all video frames are lost, which reduces their quality level. When the group of 3 GoPs is 7, the SSIM results for the videos are reduced, because DBD needs to readjust the backbone. In scenarios with 200 nodes, it is possible to see videos with a SSIM value of 0.85, because more I frames were lost due to interferences. Compared to DBF, PBF, and RND, DBD increases the video quality delivery process in 35%. When the SSIM values are below 0.6, most of the videos cannot be displayed on the destination device or the quality is so poor that the scene cannot be understandable by the end-users.

As presented in [5], it is important to have MOS experiments to really understand the video quality level from according to the human perception. The correlation between the PSNR and SSIM results and MOS scores does not have a high accuracy. Therefore, Fig. 9
                            presents the average MOS scores for all protocols when the system is configured with 50, 100, and 200 vehicles and the end-to-end route is of 4km, as well as when the distance from the source to the destinations ranges from 2 to 4km, respectively. Since the quality of the videos is too bad when PBF, RND, and DBD were configured in multimedia VANET scenarios, we will not present MOS results for these protocols.

The MOS scores confirm that DBD allows the delivery of live video sequences with a good or excellent quality level in networks with 50 and 100 vehicles. When the number of I frame lost increases, i.e., due to interferences as happened in scenarios with 200veh/km, the user experience decreases. Before the backbone scheme full implementation and the DBD conversion time, the quality level of all videos is ranked as fair or good. When VANETs are configured with DBD, it is possible to transmit video flows up to 4km with at least a good quality level.

Finally, as displayed in Fig. 10
                           , in order to give the reader an idea of the user point of view, we randomly selected a frame (# 147) from one of the videos (videotop92012, GoP 10, 50veh/km, 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                    
                                       ROI
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 2
                                 
                                 km
                              
                           ) [29] with the aim of analyzing the frames from a user point-of-view. The selected frame depicts when a car moves across the scene, from side to side. When DBD is used to control the video delivery process, it is possible to see the monitored area with an excellent quality. However, the quality level of the displayed frame when PBF, RND, and DBF are routing packets provides a not acceptable user experience.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Multimedia VANETs are well-suited for capturing and sharing surveillance, traffic accidents, and disaster-based smart city video applications, where their quality level must be measured by using QoE metrics. This article presented an application framework to allow video request and sharing and a routing protocol (DBD) to enable efficient and high quality video transmissions with QoE analysis in dynamic inter-vehicles urban highway scenarios. The paper main contributions are the following: 1 design of a backbone-based scheme to create and maintain persistent routes for real-time video delivery; (2) improvement of IEEE 802.11p MAC layer functioning to solve the SF problem in VANETs; (3) increase of system performance, by increasing the packet delivery ratio, reducing the delay, and extending the transmission range between the source and the destination; and (4) analyze the benefits and impact of DBD, DBF, PBF, and RND on the video quality level by measuring QoE metrics. With DBD, humans in emergency vehicles can receive and visually understand dangerous scenarios, thus planning in advance the best actions or instrument to use.

The simulation results highlighted the benefits of DBD in sharing live videos flows. We measured the quality level of the video flows by means of well known objective and subjective metrics for QoE, namely PSNR, SSIM, and MOS. Compared to DBF, PBF, and RND, DBD increases the SSIM of received videos in about 30% for scenarios with 100veh/km. Moreover, to our knowledge, this article is the first attempt to evaluate routing proposal for live video streaming in VANETs with real MOS experiments.

In future work, we will improve DBD with an enhanced adaptive backbone mechanism, for improving the backbone convergence time or having an active backbone maintenance (only during data transmission) to avoid the periodic performance fall, and finally, crossover optimization of the sent packets as a function of the transmitted frames. For instance, if an I frame from the flow is lost, then remainder P and B frames in the GoP can be discarded, thus avoiding the waste of bandwidth to transmit packets that will not be decoded on the receiver side.
