                  In order to enable domestic commercial banks to be more competitive globally, the Taiwanese government has twice attempted to financially restructure them, in 2001 and 2004. Different from other studies which use deterministic analyses to measure changes in performance between two periods, this paper adopts probabilistic analysis to take the uncertainty related to certain factors into account. Data from six years, from 2005 to 2010, are divided into two periods, 2005–2007 and 2008–2010, to calculate the global Malmquist productivity index (MPI) as a measure of the change in performance. By assuming beta distributions for the data, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to find the distribution of the MPI. The results show that, in general, the performance of the commercial banks has indeed improved. While conventional deterministic analyses may mislead top managers and make them overconfident about results that are actually uncertain, probabilistic analysis can produce more reliable information that can thus lead to better decisions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

After the recent global financial crisis, the financial condition of banks has attracted increased government attention. In addition, due to the globalization of financial markets, financial institutions face an increasingly competitive environment. This is particularly true in Taiwan, as it is a small island where foreign trade accounts for a large portion of its economic activities. Banks in Taiwan, as well as other countries, must thus work to operate more efficiently to face these challenges.

Ways to measure the efficiency of banks have been widely discussed in the literature, with Berger and Humphrey (1997) and Fethi and Pasiouras (2010) providing extensive surveys of the related works. At each period of time the relative efficiency of a bank can be measured by different methods. However, since most methods measure the efficiency in a relative manner, the values calculated for different periods are not comparable. It is thus possible that a bank has a greater efficiency score in a later period, although its performance has actually declined. It is also possible that a bank has a lower score in a later period, while its performance has actually improved. Caves, Christensen, and Diewert (1982) thus proposed the Malmquist productivity index (MPI), which is the ratio of the efficiencies of two periods calculated from the production technology of the former period, in order to make the relative efficiency measures of two periods comparable, and can be used to measure changes in efficiency.

The MPI has been widely applied to measure changes in performance of financial institutions, especially due to a specific act or policy. For example, it has been used to examine the effects of the deregulation of financial markets on Turkish banks (Isik & Hassan, 2003), mergers and acquisitions among Greek banks (Rezitis, 2008) and the US property–liability insurance companies (Cummins & Xie, 2008), the impacts of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on US accounting firms (Chang, Choy, Cooper, & Ruefli, 2009), and the Single Market Project of the European Commission on German insurance companies (Mahlberg & Url, 2010). The MPI produces a deterministic value, indicating with 100% certainty that the performance of a bank has either improved or worsened. However, since the real world is full of uncertainty, and the operation of banking institutions involves high externalities which lead to uncertain results, the data collected at specific time points are just instances of a probabilistic phenomenon. Consequently, the associated MPI is also probabilistic.

Even if the environment is certain, the values of the data in many cases are not precise for other reasons. For example, if data is missing, then its value must be estimated; if a situation has not occurred yet, then a value must be predicted; or if the value cannot be measured precisely, such as the volume of a tree (due to its irregular shape), then the most likely value is used. As a result, the calculated MPI is a most likely value, rather than a deterministic one, and if the estimated value is not a correct representation of the true situation, then the resulting MPI will not be correct, either. Consequently, the simulation analysis of Giraleas, Emrouznejad, and Thanassoulis (2012) shows that a significantly large measurement error will lead to estimates of MPIs that are unreliable for policy purposes.

In addition to the data itself, different ways of calculating the MPI may also lead to different values. For example, the MPI proposed by Caves et al. (1982) uses the earlier period as the base one for calculation, although the later period can also be used for this. Färe, Grosskopf, Norris, and Zhang (1994) used the geometric mean of the two MPIs calculated from different base periods as the final MPI. Pastor and Lovell (2005) proposed a global MPI by using the overall production technology constructed from the observations of all periods for calculation. The MPIs calculated from different base periods not only may be different, but sometimes they may even be inconsistent; that is, one MPI may show an improvement, while the other indicates a decline (see Kao (2010) for an example of this), which implies that it is inappropriate to represent the MPI with a single value. Therefore, a probabilistic analysis which shows the probability that a DMU has improved, or declined, between two periods, is desirable.

There are several studies that calculate the MPI by employing stochastic frontier analysis (Abdul-Majid, Saal, & Battisti, 2011; Feng & Zhang, 2012; Fuentes, Grifell-Tatje, & Perelman, 2001), although the results of this are deterministic. While Chambers (2008) defined productivity measures for stochastic cases and derived superlative approximations to these stochastic measures, these are still precise values. Eslami, Khodabakhshi, Jahanshahloo, Hosseinzadeh, and Khoveyni (2012) discussed a case of fuzzy constraints and stochastic data, where the uncertain condition is converted to a certain one; the calculated MPI is also deterministic.

In this paper we will use a probabilistic analysis to find the distribution of the MPI, the results of which are more informative and so can be used to make better decisions. For example, a probability of performance improvement greater than 0.5 may still be associated with a performance that has in fact declined. While deterministic analysis may misleadingly indicate a definite improvement, probabilistic analysis can alert decision makers to the uncertainties underlying such results, and thus highlight the need for a more careful inspection of the variations of the inputs and outputs in order to derive better policies.


                     Simar and Wilson (1998, 2000, 2007) proposed a bootstrap strategy to analyze the sensitivity of efficiency scores relative to the sampling variations of the estimated frontier. The potential biases when using conventional efficiency measures to estimate the true efficiency scores can be calculated, and the related confidence intervals can then be constructed. The bootstrapping of MPIs has also been reported (Simar & Wilson, 1999), and the major difference between this approach and the one proposed in this paper is the underlying assumption of the related distribution functions. The approach presented in this work requires several observations to estimate the corresponding distributions, whereas the bootstrap approach does not. However, the proposed method is easier to carry out, as the number of linear programs that need to be solved is only half that required with bootstrapping.

Taiwan is a newly industrialized country, and its rapid economic development since the 1990s has won it the title of one of “The Four Dragons in Asia.” As of December 2012, its foreign reserves of 403.17 billion US dollars were ranked sixth in the world. In order to handle the growth of financial-related businesses and consolidate the concept of free competition, the government opened the market for new banks in 1991. This resulted in many small banks suffering from poor financial conditions, especially with regard to non-performing loans. To solve this problem, the government launched a process of regulatory banking reforms in 2001, officially called the “First Financial Restructuring”, with the aims of decreasing the non-performing loan ratio of these financial institutions to below 5%, and increasing the capital adequacy ratio to above 8% within two years.

To expedite the effects of these reforms, the government launched the “Second Financial Restructuring” in 2004 with four major aims. The first was to have at least three financial holding companies whose market shares were greater than 10% in 2005. The second was to reduce the number of government-owned financial institutions from twelve to six in 2005. The third was to cut the number of financial holding companies by half, down to seven, in 2005. The last was to bring in foreign investors to at least one holding company. The overall aim of the government was to provide a sound financial environment for companies to manufacture products and provide services, so that Taiwan’s economy could continue growing steadily. Hsiao, Chang, Cianci, and Huang (2010) found improvements in the performance of commercial banks in the post-reform period (2004–2005), as compared to period during which the reforms were being implemented (2002–2003). After the second financial restructuring in 2005, 23 commercial banks remained. The government is obviously eager to know whether the performance of these banks has continued to improve since 2005. This paper thus measures the changes in their performance for the period 2005–2010. The results of this work will not only be helpful for the Taiwanese government, but also for other countries that are considering similar policies.

The next section reviews several studies related to evaluating the performance of Taiwanese banks. Section 3 then explains the global MPI used in this paper in some detail. The two approaches, analytical and numerical, for obtaining the distribution of the probabilistic MPI are explained in Section 4. After that, the performance changes of the commercial banks in Taiwan after the second financial restructuring are investigated in Section 5, where the results are also analyzed. Finally, in Section 6, some conclusions are drawn based on the results of this work.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The literature contains a number of studies related to evaluating the performance of Taiwanese banks. Huang (2000) used a multi-product translog normalized shadow profit function to examine X-efficiency in the Taiwanese banking industry with a panel data from 22 banks, spanning the period 1981–1995. The results indicated that larger banks tend to be more technically efficient than smaller ones. The data also showed strong technical progress during the sample period, although the model without X-inefficiency did not find this.


                     Kao and Liu (2004) predicted the performance of 24 commercial banks in Taiwan based on their financial forecasts using a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach. They found that all the efficiency scores calculated from the data contained in the subsequent financial statements published fell within the predicted ranges. Their results also showed that the poor performances of the two banks that were taken over by the Financial Restructuring Fund could actually be predicted using their approach.


                     Lin, Hsu, and Hsiao (2007) adopted DEA and the Malmquist index to measure the relative efficiency of management and variations in this, respectively, among 37 Taiwanese banks for the period 2002–2003. Six banks obtained a perfect efficiency score of 1, and 20 banks had a Malmquist index greater than 1. Based on these two measures the 37 banks were classified into eight categories, and the reasons for this were also discussed.


                     Chiu, Jan, Shen, and Wang (2008) employed the DEA technique to examine whether a bank’s technical efficiency changed significantly when capital adequacy was specified for 46 Taiwanese banks over the period 2000–2002. The major findings were that the efficiency scores of banks with high capital adequacy and high risk capital requirement were significantly higher than those with low capital adequacy and low risk capital requirement, and that bank productivity did not increase over the period studied.


                     Hsiao et al. (2010) investigated the effects of the First Financial Restructuring (FFR) on the operating efficiency of 40 commercial banks in Taiwan over a six-year period (2000–2005) using DEA. They found that while the banks had lower operating efficiency on average during the reform period (2002–2003) compared to the pre-reform one (2000–2001), their operating efficiency improved is reflected in the post-reform period (2004–2005). These results suggest that the improved efficiency in the post-reform period was possibly due to enhanced banking and risk management practices, and the benefits obtained from compliance with the FRR.

Since changes in profitability can originate from either outputs or inputs, Juo, Fu, and Yu (2012) proposed a non-oriented slacks-based measure (SBM) model to decompose changes in the operating profit into quantity and price effects for the Taiwanese banking sector for the period 1994–2002 by using the average of the base and current prices. They found that ignoring the effects of inputs on the decomposition of changes in profits would produce misleading results, thus adversely affecting managerial decision making.


                     Lin and Chiu (2013) constructed an integrated performance model with the aid of independent component analysis (ICA) and a network slacks-based measure (NSBM) to evaluate the performance of the Taiwanese banking industry. Their empirical results indicated that banks needed to avoid the increasing probability of non-performing loans. Moreover, since the size of a bank has substantially significant influences on its profitability, they suggested speeding up of mergers and acquisitions among banks.

Among the studies outlined above, Lin et al. (2007), Chiu et al. (2008), and Hsiao et al. (2010) calculated MPIs, in addition to efficiency scores. However, their findings contradict each other, which again indicate that deterministic analysis is not sufficient to gain a clear overall picture of this issue, and that probabilistic analysis is thus needed.

Two major approaches, parametric and nonparametric, have been proposed for measuring the MPI. They have different merits, and may also produce conflicting results. However, Casu, Girardone, and Molyneux (2004) compared the two approaches using data from the European banking sector between 1994 and 2000, and the results were not significantly different. MPI is basically the ratio of the efficiencies of period t
                     +1 and t, as in the following equation:

                     where the subscript k represents the bank being considered. A value greater than 1 indicates that the performance of bank k has improved; otherwise, it has declined (or remained the same if it is equal to 1).

The efficiency 
                        
                           
                              
                                 E

                     , in Eq. (1) can be calculated by different techniques. A survey carried out by Färe, Grosskopf, and Roos (1998) reported that the majority of empirical studies have used DEA to measure efficiency. This is because DEA does not require a pre-specified function form, and thus does not have the problem of misspecification, which will lead to biased estimates (Banker, 1993; Giraleas et al., 2012; Ondrich & Ruggiero, 2001; Ruggiero, 1999, 2004).

DEA is a nonparametric technique for measuring the relative efficiency of a set of decision making units (DMUs) which use multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. Let 
                        
                           (

                                 j
                              
                              
                                 p

                     =1,…,
                     n, in period p. There are two types of model for measuring efficiency, input- and output-oriented. The former refers to using a smaller amount of input to produce the same amount of output, whereas the latter refers to using the same amount of input to produce a greater amount of output. Different models may produce different results in efficiency measurement. Since suggesting that a bank reduce its capital or number of employees may not be practical, an output-oriented model is used to show the target outputs of the bank under the current inputs. The output-oriented efficiency of DMU k in period p, under the assumption of variable returns to scale, is calculated via the following linear program (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984):

The MPI used in this paper is the global MPI. One reason for using this form is that Model (3) for calculating the efficiency of one period based on the production technology of another is the same as the one for calculating super efficiencies (Andersen & Petersen, 1993), and is thus infeasible under certain conditions (Seiford & Zhu, 1999; Thrall, 1996), whereas Model (4) for calculating

                      is always feasible. Another reason is that the global MPI has some good properties, of which circularity (Pastor & Lovell, 2007) is a prominent one. Recall that circularity requires the product of the MPIs for the periods t

                     t′<
                     t″. In the next section we will discuss how to obtain the probabilistic MPI when the data is also probabilistic.

In mathematics there are two general approaches, analytical and numerical, for solving problems. We will use the following example to explain how to use these two approaches to obtain the distribution of a probabilistic MPI from the distribution of the probabilistic data.

                      are assumed to be deterministic to obtain deterministic MPI measures. When some observations are probabilistic, the calculated MPI will also be probabilistic.

Consider a very simple example of three DMUs labeled as A, B, and C in Fig. 1
                     , where 1, 2.25, and 4 units of single input X are used to produce 1, 2, and 3 units of single output Y, respectively, in period t. In period t+1, DMUs A and C remain the same, while DMU B moves to (3, 2.5); that is, 3 units of X are used to produce 2.5 units of Y. The global production frontier of this case is indicated by the line segments

                        =1. The MPI has a range of [45/46,37/32]=[0.9783,1.1563]. It is uniformly distributed in the range of [1,37/32], with a density of 8/3 (derived from the cumulative density function of Eq. (7)). While the distribution of MPI

In the deterministic analysis MPI
                           B
                         is a constant of 1, indicating that the performance of DMU B remains the same from period t to t
                        +1, with 100% certainty. Here, in the probabilistic analysis, MPI
                           B
                         is equal to 1 with a probability of 1/3, indicating that the performance of DMU B has only a 1/3 probability of remaining the same. There also is a probability of 5/12 that it has improved, and a probability of 1/4 that it is worsened. The constant value of MPI
                           B
                        
                        =1 is obviously an overconfident estimate of the interval value of MPI
                           B
                        
                        ∈[0.9783,1.1563] obtained from the probabilistic data. The original probabilistic data, rather than an approximated constant, should thus be used to obtain reliable and more informative results.

While using the analytical approach to derive the distribution of the MPI appears to be very attractive, it is clear that the derivation is possible only for very simple cases. For larger problems with more input/output factors or more DMUs, even if there is only one probabilistic observation, the analytical derivation becomes intractable. In this case, one may rely on simulation, a numerical technique.

                         can be obtained, then the distribution of MPI
                           k
                         can also be derived by applying statistical theories. Unfortunately, studies of probabilistic DEA have not been successful in deriving the closed-form distribution of the probabilistic efficiency measure for general cases.

Simulations have been shown to be an effective way to deal with complicated problems for which analytical solutions are intractable. A simulation technique can thus be applied to find the distribution of the MPI defined in Eq. (8). The idea underlying this is a straightforward one: generate a set of

                                    p
                                 
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Y

                         values from their respective distributions and use them to calculate an MPI via Eq. (8). This process is repeated a number of times until some termination rules are satisfied. The distribution of the MPI can then be constructed from the results of the simulation. For the example discussed in the preceding section, suppose that a value of 1.76 is generated from the uniform [1.75,2.75] distribution for 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    X
                                 
                                 
                                    B
                                 
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                              
                           
                        . By applying Eq. (8), an MPI of 0.9790 is obtained. Similarly, if a value of 2.54 is generated, then the corresponding MPI is 1.0775. After a number of replications, the distribution of the MPI can be obtained.

A certain number of replications is needed to estimate the distribution of the MPI, and this is dependent on the desired precision of the results. Let

                        2(m) is the variance of X, and α is the significance level. Kao and Liu (2009) found that when estimating the distribution of the stochastic efficiency score, the mean can be estimated precisely with a relatively small number of samples. The shape of the corresponding empirical distribution, however, is not smooth, indicating that the sample variance is not sufficiently close to the population variance. Therefore, it is suggested that the precision of the variance be used to determine the required sample size.

                        =0.05, is 16. Since 30 batches have already been simulated, the results of the 6000 (=200×30) observations have the desired precision for estimating the distribution of the MPI. As a verification, the mean MPI of the 6000 observations, 1.0309, has a relative error of 0.001166 (=[1.0309−1.0297]/1.0297), and the variance of the MPI, 0.002637, has a relative error of 0.03396 (=[0.002637−0.002550]/0.002550), both of which are smaller than the specified relative error of 0.05.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the empirical distribution of the MPI obtained from 6000 replications. Visually, it is almost the same as the theoretical distribution shown in Fig. 2. The probability that the MPI will appear in a certain range can be estimated from the empirical distribution. For example, the probabilities that the MPI is less than, equal to, and greater than 1 are 0.257, 0.325, and 0.418, respectively, which are 1542, 1950, and 2508 out of 6000 replications. Compared to the theoretical values of 0.25, 0.3333 and 0.4167, the errors are 2.8%, 2.4902%, and 0.3120%, respectively. If smaller errors are desired, one simply conducts more replications.

The purpose of this paper is to measure the change in performance of Taiwanese commercial banks after the second financial restructuring using probabilistic data. One of the most important tasks in efficiency measurement is to identify the input and output factors, and there are two approaches used to achieve this in the banking literature: production and intermediation (Humphrey, 1985). The production approach views the bank as a production system, such that the staff, equipment, floor space, and so on, in physical measures, are used as the inputs to attract different types of deposit and loan accounts, in numbers, as the outputs. The intermediation approach, which is more commonly used, views banks as financial intermediaries, and this the inputs and outputs are measured in monetary terms.

According to the Banking Law of the Republic of China (Taiwan), the primary functions of commercial banks are to receive different kinds of deposits and to offer credit. In this sense, commercial banks in Taiwan are essentially financial intermediaries, whose main business is to borrow funds from depositors to lend to others, and thus the intermediation approach is used in this study. Following the ideas of Aly, Grabowski, Pasurka, and Rangan (1990) and Wheelock and Wilson (1999), we adopt a traditional user-cost framework to define the associated input and output items, which have been used in Yeh (1996), Kao and Liu (2004, 2009) and Hsiao et al. (2010), to measure the performance of Taiwanese banks.

Under this framework, each category of a bank’s assets is classified as an input, and different categories of liabilities are classified as outputs in this study, and labor (X
                     1), physical capital (X
                     2), and purchased funds (X
                     3) are used as the inputs, and demand deposits (Y
                     1), short-term loans (Y
                     2), and medium-and-long-term loans (Y
                     3) are selected as the outputs. Purchased funds include time and saving deposits, as well as other bank deposits, and demand deposits include checking, house checking, passbook, and temporary deposits. Physical capital is the book value of fixed assets for business purposes. All of these input and output factors are expressed in monetary values.

Risk is also an important factor when evaluating bank performance, as seen in the adverse affects associated with most recent international financial crisis. However, as pointed out by Hwang and Wu (2007), improving the functioning of the Financial Supervisory Commission and consolidating the financial industry are two major actions that have helped to prevent financial crises from harming Taiwanese institutions. In other words, alleviating the impact of international financial crises seems to be something that must be carried out at the national government level. Risk at the firm level is thus not considered in this study.

After the second financial restructuring, several smaller banks were merged into larger ones. For the commercial banks listed on the TSEC (Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation), 23 have annual data from 2005 to 2010 and are selected for this study. To measure the improvement in performance from 2005 to 2010, these six years are divided into two periods, 2005–2007 and 2008–2010. Table 1
                      shows the three-year averages for the six input/output factors of the 23 banks in two periods in billions of New Taiwan dollars (1USD≅30NTD).

The average of the annual data is generally used to measure the overall efficiency of a period covering several years. For example, Kao and Hwang (2008) used two-year averages (2001 and 2002) to calculate the efficiency of non-life insurance companies in Taiwan, while Portela, Camanho, and Borges (2012) used the average results of basic education exams in 2005 and 2006 to measure the performance of Portuguese secondary schools. In conventional deterministic analysis, the MPIs of the 23 banks between the two periods are calculated via Eq. (8) using the data contained in Table 1. The results are shown in the second column of Table 2
                     , where most of the mean MPIs are greater than one. There are only two banks whose MPIs are less than one, and six that are equal to one, indicating that, in general, the performance of the banks keeps improving after the second financial restructuring.

In the deterministic analysis, only the average data is used, meaning that the variations in the data can be ignored. To fully utilize all three observations in each period, the data is assumed to be probabilistic, following a beta distribution, as this is suitable to describe the characteristics of data when there is no prior information regarding its distribution (Law & Kelton, 2000). This distribution has two shape parameters, α
                     1 and α
                     2, with a mean of α
                     1/(α
                     1
                     +
                     α
                     2). Various values of α
                     1 and α
                     2 form functions of different shapes, from a bathtub to a bell. It is skewed to the right if α
                     2
                     >
                     α
                     1
                     >1, and to the left if α
                     1
                     >
                     α
                     2
                     >1. Based on Beckman and Tietjen (1978), the parameters α
                     1 and α
                     2 of a beta distribution are estimated from the three annual observations of a bank for each input/output factor in each period.

There are, in total, 23(banks)×6(factors)×2(periods)=276 distributions. Notably, all 276 distributions have α
                     2
                     >
                     α
                     1
                     >1, indicating that the corresponding density functions are skewed to the right. This coincides with general intuition and expectations. Following the procedure described in Section 4.2, the distributions of the MPI of the 23 banks between the two periods are obtained via a Monte Carlo simulation.

For each replication in the simulation, a set of 276 variates is generated from their respective beta distributions as a specific instance to calculate an MPI. In order to get a better estimate of the mean and variance of the MPI, 50 batches of simulation, each with 200 replications, are conducted. For each batch, the mean and variance of the MPI of each bank are first calculated, and then the mean and variance of the variances of the 50 batches are obtained. The largest variance from the 23 banks has a value of

                     Fig. 4
                      shows the empirical distribution of the MPI of Bank Chang Hwa (No. 1) obtained from the simulation of 10,000 (=200(replications)×50(batches)) replications. The shape of the distribution looks smooth, implying that 10,000 replications are sufficient for estimating the true distribution. The average MPI of the 10,000 replications is 1.0582, with the smallest and largest values of 0.9634 and 1.1529, respectively. One merit of the probability distribution is that it provides the probability that the values in a specific interval will occur. In general, there are three intervals that the top management is interested in, which are less than, equal to, and greater than 1, because they indicate that the performance is declining, remaining the same, and improving, respectively. For this bank, there are 166, 0, and 9834 out of 10,000 replications whose MPIs are less than, equal to, and greater than 1, and whose corresponding probabilities are thus 0.0166, 0, and 0.9834, respectively.

The third column of Table 2 shows the average of the MPIs calculated from 10,000 replications for the 23 banks. They are consistent with those calculated from the deterministic analysis, except those for Cathay (No. 13), whose deterministic analysis shows an improvement, while the probabilistic analysis indicates a decline. The average of the mean MPIs of the 23 banks is 1.0690, which is a little smaller than that of the deterministic analysis, 1.0715. The probabilistic analysis also shows that, in general, the performance of the commercial banks in Taiwan keeps improving after the second financial restructuring. The last three columns of Table 2 show the probabilities of the 23 banks whose MPIs are less than, equal to, and greater than 1, respectively.

The major finding of the preceding analysis, which is also the reason for using probabilistic analysis in this work, is that the conventional deterministic analysis is overconfident with regard to results that are actually uncertain. The deterministic MPI states in a definite fashion whether the performance in two periods is declining, remaining the same, or improving. In contrast, the probabilistic analysis, which presumably produces accurate results, states the probabilities of the three cases. For the 23 banks, the probabilistic analysis suggests a conclusive result of declining, remaining the same, or improving performance only for nine banks, Numbers 3, 5, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20, and 22 (as a probability of 1 appears in one category). Suppose Hua Nan (No. 11) and China Development (No. 14), which have a strong evidence suggesting non-improving performance, and King’s Town (No. 2), Yuanta (No. 16), Mega (No. 17), and Taiwan Cooperative (No. 23), which have a strong evidence suggesting non-declining performance, are considered to have conclusive results. Moreover, if an error of approximately 10% is allowed, there are still three banks, Cosmos (No. 6), Cathay (No. 13), and China Trust (No. 21), which do not have a conclusive result, and are thus worthy of further discussion.

For Cathay, there is a probability of 0.573 of declining and of 0.427 of improving. Its deterministic MPI of 1.0037, indicating a definite improvement, is obviously an overconfident interpretation of the uncertain results. Cosmos and China Trust are similar, in that they both have notable probabilities (0.2198 and 0.1864) that their performance is declining, while the deterministic MPI shows definite improvements. One indicator that has been used for measuring the performance of a company is EPS (earnings per share), and it can be used to explain the stochastic nature of the MPI. Cathay has EPS of 0.83, −0.81, 1.31, 0.92, 1.66, and 2.17 from 2005 to 2010. While the trend is increasing, the high value of 1.31 in 2007 indicates that the performance in the second half of the six-year period is declining for a period of time. Similarly, although the EPS of 0.06, −6, −6.58, −3.67, −6.14, and −2.10 for Cosmos from 2005 to 2010, and 2.61, 1.95, −2.19, 1.75, 0.61, and 1.76 for China Trust, show an increasing trend from the first half to the second in the six-year period, the decline of the EPS from 2008 to 2009 for both companies indicates that their performances declined for a period of time. This explains why no conclusive results were obtained for these banks.

In previous studies concerning the change in performance of commercial banks in Taiwan, Lin et al. (2007) indicated an improvement for the period 2002–2003, Chiu et al. (2008) showed a non-increasing trend over the period 2000–2002, and Hsiao et al. (2010) indicated a decline between the periods 2000–2001 and 2002–2003. Different results are thus obtained for similar periods of time. The probabilistic results found in the current work clearly indicate that the deterministic analysis conducted in previous studies revealed an incomplete picture of the status of these banks.

In simulation studies, more replications produce more precise results. Although Eq. (9) can be used to calculate the number of replications required to achieve the pre-specified level of precision, because the mean and variance used are estimations, rather than true values, more replications are always recommended whenever possible. While 10,000 replications were used in this study, a further simulation with 30,000 replications was also conducted, the findings were roughly the same, indicating that the results of this work are quite reliable.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Conventionally, the data collected for calculating the MPI are assumed to have deterministic values, so that the associated model is tractable. In reality, however, the data are probabilistic due to disturbances caused by a number of uncertain factors in the financial environment. For this reason, this paper adopts a probabilistic analysis to investigate the change in performance of 23 commercial banks in Taiwan after the second financial restructuring that was carried out in 2004. Six-year data for 2005–2010 are divided into two periods, 2005–2007 and 2008–2010, to calculate the global MPI in order to examine how the performance of these banks changed.

As expected, in general the performance of the commercial banks improved. Of the 23 banks, only four had a mean MPI less than 1, with sixteen greater than 1. From a probabilistic point of view, only five banks saw declines in performance, even if we set a very low probability of 0.1 for the MPI being less than 1 as the threshold for a decline. In contrast, thirteen banks saw improvements in performance, even if we set a very large probability of 0.8 for the MPI being greater than 1 as the threshold for deciding this.

The most important feature of probabilistic analysis is that it provides information about probabilities, in addition to averages. These probabilities can alert top managers that the results from deterministic analysis may in fact be unreliable, and thus they are more useful with regard to decision making. For the case of the Taiwanese commercial banks, five banks highlight the importance of this, namely Cosmos, Cathay, China Development, Mega, and China Trust. For Cosmos, Cathay, and China Trust, the deterministic analysis indicates a definite improvement in performance, while the probabilistic analysis shows significant probabilities of declines. For Mega, the deterministic analysis shows no change in performance, while the probabilistic analysis shows a noticeable probability of an improvement, and for China Development the deterministic results show a definite decline, versus a significant probability of performance remaining the same in the probabilistic results.

This study has some policy implications for both the government and banks. For the government, this study shows that the policy of financial reforms has been effective in improving the performance of banks. Currently, the Taiwanese government is considering launching the Third Financial Restructuring, and the results of this study should encourage them to proceed with such plans. For individual banks, the results indicate that for those whose mean MPI is greater (less) than 1, while still having a significant probability that their actual MPI is less (greater) than 1, a more careful inspection of the variations in inputs and outputs is necessary if more appropriate decisions are to be made.

One limitation of this work is that the beta distributions used for the simulation were estimated from three observations, which may not be enough to obtain representative distributions. In future studies, maybe quarterly or monthly data should be collected to have sufficient numbers of observations to obtain more reliable distributions.
