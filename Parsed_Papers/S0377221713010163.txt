                  Recently, there is a growing concern about the environmental and social footprint of business operations. While most of the papers in the field of supply chain network design focus on economic performance, recently, some studies have considered environmental dimensions.
                  However, there still exists a gap in quantitatively modeling social impacts together with environmental and economic impacts. In this study, this gap is covered by simultaneously considering the three pillars of sustainability in the network design problem. A mixed integer programming model is developed for this multi-objective closed-loop supply chain network problem. In order to solve this NP-hard problem, three novel hybrid metaheuristic methods are developed which are based on adapted imperialist competitive algorithms and variable neighborhood search. To test the efficiency and effectiveness of these algorithms, they are compared not only with each other but also with other strong algorithms. The results indicate that the nested approach achieves better solutions compared with the others. Finally, a case study for a glass industry is used to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Supply Chain Network Design (SCND) as a strategic decision plays the main role in the performance of a supply chain. SCND contains the determination of locations, numbers and capacities of network facilities as well as the material flow through the network. The configuration of the logistics network cannot be changed in short term as its change is very costly and time-consuming. SCND is also a crucially important decision, as it constrains the subsequent tactical and operational decisions.

While for many years, minimizing the total cost or maximizing the profit was the main objective of supply chains, nowadays, they are responsible for the environmental impacts of their products and operations, the health and safety of their employees and the whole society. In this way, activists, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and media are demanding the firms to take the responsibility of not only their own actions but also other partnersin the supply chains. Moreover, governments have enacted legislations in favor of the environment such as regulations for greenhouse gases (GHGs) reduction in European Union, Australia and Canada.

All in all, supply chains are shifting toward Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) with various motivations such as gaining public image (Fombrun, 2005), satisfying activists’ requirements (Spar & La Mure, 2003), and maintaining customers for long term (Bhattacharya & Sen, 2004). Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) is defined as the consideration of environmental and social impacts of supply chain operations as well as its economic performance in the management of information, material and capital flow (Seuring & Müller, 2008). Accordingly, there is a gap in the previously published papers in the area of logistics network design. These papers lack in the simultaneous consideration of triple bottom lines of sustainability which can be attributed to the complexity of modeling social impacts and to some extent environmental aspects.

Based on the aforementioned considerations,this paper addresses the issue of multi-objective, multi-echelon logistics network design including suppliers, plants, distribution centers, retailers, customer zones, collection/inspection centers and recycling. This model can be distinguished from the previous studies in the following directions. Firstly, the social dimension of sustainability is quantified and embedded as a distinct objective besides total costs and environmental impacts. Secondly, the forward and reverse logistics are integrated in a general Closed Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) model. Finally, it should be noted that logistics network design is an NP-hard problem (Eckert & Gottlieb, 2002; Jo, Li, & Gen, 2007; Syarif, Yun, & Gen, 2002). Thus, we have developed and compared three novel metaheuristics called nested, hybrid, and two-phase to find Pareto-optimal solutions.

The paper is organized as follows. Relevant previous researches are reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3, the problem is described in detail. In Section 4, the optimization technique and characteristics of metaheuristics are explained, respectively. Experimental evaluations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms against each other in terms of different criteria in Section 5. Section 6 is devoted to the case study. Finally, Section 7 presents the main conclusions and future lines of research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Recently, sustainability has intrigued both researchers and practitioners. In this way, Tang and Zhou (2012) has reviewed recent operations research/management science research developments in the domain of environmentally and socially sustainable operations. Brandenburg, Govindan, Sarkis, and Seuring (2014) has reviewed quantitative models that address sustainability aspects in the forward supply chain. While for decades, a lot of papers have focused on SCND, due to the increasing importance of sustainability, some articles have considered environmental and/or social impacts of SCND as additional objective(s) for multi-objective SCND (Chaabane, Ramudhin, & Paquet, 2012; Chen, Govindan, & Golias, 2013; Dehghanian & Mansour, 2009; Elhedhli & Merrick, 2012; Fonseca, García-Sánchez, Ortega-Mier, & Saldanha-da-Gama, 2010; Govindan, Jafarian, Devika, & Khodaverdi, 2014; Kannan, Diabat, Alrefaei, Govindan, & Yong, 2012; Pishvaee, Torabi, & Razmi, 2012b; Wang, Lai, & Shi, 2011a). In this paper, we review specific related SCND problems for forward, reverse and closed-loop SCND problems.

According to Tables 1 and 2
                     
                     , most of the previous researches have utilized Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) to model the problem. These models range from simple single objective forward facility location models (e.g. Jayaraman & Pirkul (2001)) to complex multi-objective closed-loop models (e.g. Chaabane et al. (2012)).


                     Elhedhli and Merrick (2012) have considered emission costs alongside fixed and variable location and production costs in a forward SCND problem. They have used a concave function to model the relationship between CO2 emissions and vehicle weight. As the direct solution of their proposed model is not possible, Lagrangian relaxation is used to solve it Wang et al. (2011a) have considered the environmental concerns of forward SCND by proposing a multi-objective optimization model that captures the trade-off between the total costs and the environmental impacts. Pishvaee et al. (2012b) proposed a credibility-based fuzzy mathematical model for a forward supply chain network with three stages. Their model aims to minimize both the environmental impacts and the total costs. They showed the applicability of the model as well as the usefulness of the solution method in an industrial case study.

Recently, the importance of collecting and treating end-of-life (EOL) products has increased substantially. Sasikumar and Kannan (2008a,2008b, 2009) and Pokharel and Mutha (2009) overviewed various aspects of Reverse Logistics (RL). Accordingly, design of RL networks has interested researchers considerably (Kannan et al., 2012; Srivastava, 2008). Pishvaee, Kianfar, and Karimi (2010) developed a mixed integer linear programming model for a multistage RL network in which both opening and transportation costs have been taken into account. Since the model is NP-hard, they have proposed simulated annealing algorithm with special neighborhood search mechanisms. Kannan et al. (2012) considered the environmental impacts of the RL network model proposed by Pishvaee et al. (2010) by appending a carbon footprint term to the objective function. They tested their model with a case study in a plastic industry. Fonseca et al. (2010) developed a bi-objective model in which total costs and environmental impacts of an RL network are taken into account. By using a two-stage stochastic programming, the uncertainty of both shipping costs and waste generation amount is captured in their model. They applied the model for a case in the province of Cordoba.

To avoid the sub-optimality which arises in separate modeling of forward and reverse networks, many researchers have integrated forward and reverse network design known as closed-loop SCND (CLSC) (Soleimani, Esfahani, & Govindan, 2013). Fleischmann, Beullens, Bloemhof-Ruwaard, and Van Wassenhove (2001) suggested a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for designing a CLSC. They showed that often RL operations can be efficiently integrated into existing forward logistics. Schultmann, Zumkeller, and Rentz (2006) considered EOL vehicle treatment in Germany. They concentrated on the flow of used products and reintegrated reverse flow of used products into their genuine supply chains. They have modeled RL with vehicle routing planning and finally have used Tabu search (TS) to solve the model.


                     Wang and Hsu (2010) have integrated environmental issues in an integer CLSC model and also have developed a genetic algorithm (GA) based on a spanning tree structure to solve the propounded NP-hard model. Pishvaee and Razmi (2012) proposed a multi-objective fuzzy mathematical programming model for designing an environmental supply chain under inherent uncertainty of input data in such problem. They applied Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method to quantify the environmental influence of the network.

Due to the plethora of literature about SCND, in Table 2 we have classified the published literature according to six main features: type of network, objectives, modeling, logistics network stages, model outputs and solution method. To summarize Table 2, a coding system is presented in Table 1 by which the literature is reviewed in Table 2.

As shown in Table 2, minimizing the cost of the network is the most common objective in the surveyed models and recently a few papers have dealt with sustainable network design.

As most of the network design problems are NP-hard, numerous solution methods including heuristics, metaheuristics and Lagrangian-based methods are developed. Due to the importance of the solution methods, the last column of Table 2 depicts the solution methods.

As it is depicted in Table 2, only Dehghanian and Mansour (2009) and Pishvaee, Razmi, and Torabi (2012a) have proposed models in which social impacts of SCND have been taken into account. However, our work can be distinguished from previous papers. Firstly, we try to quantitatvely model different social aspects alongside environmental and economic aspects in a single MILP model. Secondly, while Dehghanian and Mansour (2009) and Pishvaee et al. (2012a) model forward and reverse networks, respectively, our model investigates closed-loop network.Last but not least, novel metaheursitc algorithms are proposed and compared to solve this complex model.

In this paper, as illustrated in Fig. 1
                     , we introduce an MILP formulation for a CLSC network design problem with ten echelons. The proposed model emphasizes the treatment process by considering four types of facilities called treatment centers in the reverse network: (i) Recovering: the EOL products are recovered for reuse; (ii) Remanufacturing: the EOL products are remanufactured and prepared for reuse; (iii) Recycling: the EOL products are recycled and they are used for manufacturing new products; and (iv) Disposal: the EOL products are completely disposed as their quality is too low for manufacturing.

The proposed model is based on the following common assumptions in the literature (Hsu & Wang, 2009; Syarif et al., 2002; Wang & Hsu, 2010; Yao & Hsu, 2009):
                        
                           •
                           the demand of customers must be satisfied.

the number of facilities in each echelon as well as their potential sites is restrained by pre-defined values.

there is no flow between the facilities of the same echelon.

As a special characteristic of closed-loop logistics and suggested by Van Der Laan, Salomon, Dekker, and Van Wassenhove (1999), we assume that the number of the EOL products returned to the collection/inspection centers is a fraction of the customers’ demands. In addition,they are allocated to the treatment facilities based on their qualities.

The problem in study can be stated as follows:
                        
                           •
                           Given:
                                 
                                    ∘
                                    the set of potential sites for locating facilities;

the set of available technologies for manufacturing;

the demand of customers;

the cost of opening facilities and shipping materials;

the environmental impact of opening facilities and shipping materials;

the fraction of EOL products in each customer zone which is returned to the respective collection/inspection center;

the fraction of EOL products classified in the collection/inspection centers for each treatment center;

the fraction of EOL products transported from each treatment center to the reuse market;

and the capacity of suppliers.

Determine:
                                 
                                    ∘
                                    the supply chain topology;

the technologies of manufacturing centers;

the amount of products which have to be manufactured at each plant;

the assignment of customers to distribution centers and collection/inspection centers;

and the flow of materials.

The major contributions and features that distinguish this study from the previous ones are as follows:
                        
                           •
                           the trade-off between three pillars of sustainability is captured by proposing a tri-objectives model.

the forward and reverse logistics are integrated, while many previous closed-loop supply chain networks are just extended forward logistics networks. In this way, recovered, remanufactured and recycled EOL products are returned to the forward chain.

different environmental impacts resulted from opening facilities, manufacturing at plants and handling products at facilities as well as products damages to the environment are modeled.

the following different social impacts are quantified as a separate objective:
                                 
                                    ∘
                                    
                                       Created job opportunities: The created job opportunities are divided into two categories: fixed jobs which does not depend on the capacity of a facility like managerial positions and variable jobs like workers that vary by the capacity of facilities;


                                       Workers’ safety: works’ damages occurred during their work are categorized to two groups: those occurred during the establishment of facilities and those occurred during the opening process;

the technologies available for production at plants have specific costs, emissions, and social impacts as well as different fraction of broken parts (i.e. products which are useless as they are broken during the production process).

The notations of the proposed model are presented in Table 3
                     .

In terms of the above notations, the CLSC network design problem can be formulated as follows:

                     The first objective tries to minimize the total costs of the network. In this objective, the first and second terms are the fixed costs of opening facilities. The third to eighth summations are associated with purchasing, manufacturing, handling, transportation, assignment and collection costs. The last four terms stand for the savings resulted from reusing products at the manufacturing centers, from redistributing recovered or remanufactured products, and from selling products to reuse market.

The second objective, environmental impacts of the network, is as follows:

                     The first and second terms of this objective are the created fixed job opportunities, that is, the job positions like managers which are required independent of the utilized capacity of the facility. In contrast to fixed jobs, variable jobs are those that totally depend on the used capacity of the facility. The third to sixth terms show these kinds of jobs. For instance, a facility needs more workers when it uses its whole capacity and, conversely, it uses fewer workers when less capacity is required. The seventh to twelfth terms stand for the work’s damages which are caused either during the establishment of facilities or during the manufacturing and handling of products. The constraints of the model are as follows:

The following constraints ensure that the flow of products is maintained and the demands are satisfied.

The large-scale optimization problem requires some optimization techniques to search the problem space profoundly and to optimize the problem effectively and efficiently. In this regard, hybrid and decomposed optimization methods represent important classes of optimization techniques which have a direct implication for solving many real-world problems. In this paper three different hybridization methods have been proposed to handle this problem. The first method, constructed by hybridizing adapted imperialist competitive algorithm (AICA) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm, is named (Hybrid ICA and VNS). HIV, the second one, is (Two-phase ICA and VNS) TIV, and the third method is (Nested ICA and VNS) NIV. We have not only compared these methods with each other, but also examined their performances with some benchmark methods (i.e. hybrid GA (Holland, 1975) and SA (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, & Vecchi, 1983)(HGS), two-phase SA and TS. (Glover, 1989)(TST) (Ross & Jayaraman, 2008) and nested GA and SA (NGS)). In the following subsection, the multi-objective technique, common features that are the same for both proposed methods and benchmark ones, the principal metaheuristics, and the different hybridization techniques are presented.

The proposed problem has three conflicting objectives. In this problem, there is a trade-off between objectives that makes it impossible to reach a single optimal solution which optimizes the value of all objectives simultaneously. This trade-off often leads to a set of optimal solutions at the end of optimization process called Pareto optimal solutions. For each Pareto optimal solution, it is impossible to improve any objective without deteriorating at least another objective. These types of problems fall in the domain of multi-objective optimization. To achieve the Pareto optimal solutions, we apply a normal constraint method introduced by Messac, Ismail-Yahaya, and Mattson (2003). This method is graphically illustrated in Fig. 2
                         and summarized below. For more detailed description refer to Messac et al. (2003).

Firstly, each objective (i.e. OBJ1, OBJ2 and OBJ3) is solely optimized without considering other objectives. These solutions denoted by

                         are called anchor points in the objective space. Secondly, a hyper plane called utopia hyper plane encompasses all anchor points as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). Then, the Pareto frontier is generated by projecting a set of points evenly distributed over the utopia hyper plane on the Pareto surface as shown in Fig. 2(b). Indeed, an optimization problem is solved for each point. Finally, the non-dominated solutions are omitted.

The encoding of three different sub-solutions is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3
                        . In order to search in feasible space, we used a two-stage technique named random-key (RK) technique that in the first phase generates a continuous solution (parts a), and in the second phase parses the solution (parts b) as a feasible one (Naderi, Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, & Khalili, 2010). RK technique as an encoding scheme is frequently utilized with the aim of enabling the continuous approach to solve discrete problems (Naderi et al., 2010). This technique is easily applied to parse the primary solution. As shown in Fig. 3(a), firstly, a matrix with ∣P∣ elements each with uniform distribution U (0,1) is produced where the RK shows the desired number of plants restricted with P
                        
                           Max
                        . For instance, the encoded solution {0.82,0.12,0.24,0.65,0.53} represents the parsed solution {1,0,0,1,1} with P
                        max
                        =3 (Fig. 3(a)). This sub-solution is also used in selecting the distribution centers, retailers, collection/inspection centers and recycling centers. In addition, according to Fig. 3(b), we should specify a technology for each plant. In this regard, for each plant, we generate a uniformly distributed random number with RK, which shows the chosen technology by rounding these numbers. For example, the encoded solution {2.12,3.14,1.56} represents the parsed solution {2,3,2} that reveals the second technology for the first and third plants and the third technology for the second one. In the same way, this sub-solution is utilized in allocating the customer zones to retailers and collection/inspection centers. Finally, the flow of products is determined in the third sub-solution (Fig. 3(c)). In this regard, a ∣P
                        2∣×∣D∣, ∣P
                        2∣⩽
                        P
                        
                           Max
                         random matrix is generated by which the next part of the solution, the flow of products from selected plants to the distribution centers, is determined based on selected facilities in sub-solution (a). Therefore, we can intelligently reduce the dimensions of the matrix by using the selected facilities, and save plenty of time. Then, the columns of the second matrix are normalized to determine how distribution centers divide their demands between different selected plants.

The initialization process, as illustrated in Fig. 4
                        , is utilized to sample nPop particles which constitute the population. These particles are randomly generated in the feasible region, which is an N dimensional hyperspace with uniform distribution U (l
                        
                           n
                        ,
                        u
                        
                           n
                        ), (u
                        
                           n
                        ) and (l
                        
                           n
                        ) are upper and lower bounds, respectively (Su & Lin, 2011). Once the particles are produced, a conversion method is used to parse the primary solutions with the corresponding values of each particle in the discrete area, and subsequently, the particles are evaluated.

ICA introduced by Atashpaz-Gargari and Lucas (2007) simulates the social-political process of imperialism and imperialistic competition. Although this algorithm is considered as a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm in the Evolutionary Computation field (Atashpaz-Gargari & Lucas, 2007), ICA has been widely applied for many non-polynomial (NP) hard optimization problems in supply chain management (Forouharfard & Zandieh, 2010; Naimi Sadigh, Mozafari, & Karimi, 2012). It has been considered through solving different optimization problems that the evolutionary optimization strategy represented in ICA has a high performance and applicability both in terms of convergence and in finding the global optima (Meysam Mousavi et al., 2013). Similar to the other evolutionary algorithms, ICA starts with an initial population (nPop). Each individual of the population is called a country and is divided in two groups: imperialists and colonies (Bagher, Zandieh, & Farsijani, 2011). Those countries with the best objective values are selected as imperialist countries and the remaining countries are divided among imperialists based on their power. An empire is composed of an imperialist and their colonies. In this regard, imperialists can administrate on a number of countries based on their power which is calculated based on the objective function. Subsequently, the total power of an empire is calculated by summing the power of the imperialist country and a percentage of mean power of its colonies. After initialization of an empire’s configuration, the competition will be started by moving colonies in all empires toward their imperialists, and the imperialists try to acquire more colonies. During each competition the weakest imperialist will be collapsed, and finally just one imperialist will remain and will be considered as the best solution. (Lucas, Nasiri-Gheidari, & Tootoonchian, 2010). Furthermore, global war occurs after some iterations for the preservation of premature convergence. For a more detailed review of this algorithm readers are referred to (Atashpaz-Gargari & Lucas, 2007; Gargari, Hashemzadeh, Rajabioun, & Lucas, 2008).The framework of the proposed AICA is described in the following.

In this respect, ICA is looking for the best country with the best combination of socio-political characteristics such as culture, language, economic policy and religion (Atashpaz-Gargari & Lucas, 2007). This perspective paves the ground to find the optimal solution: i.e., the solution with the least cost value. The cost of a country is calculated using a cost function f at the variables (P

In the ICA, colonies are trying to improve their power by capturing more imperialist countries at the help of assimilation policy. This policy is modeled by moving all the colonies toward the imperialist. As illustrated in Fig. 5
                           , the colony’s position is modified with the empire’s position. In this regard, a new array (c
                           
                              na

                           ) is generated with value zero and one randomly. The positions of colonies are modified based on the imperialist array and named as assimilated colonies (P

                            close to 0 reduces the search ability of the algorithm (Atashpaz-Gargari & Lucas, 2007). As shown in Fig. 6
                           , to search profoundly around the imperialists, a random amount of the deviation is added to the direction of the movement. Where, θ is a random number with uniform distribution [−λ, λ]. λ is set to define the deviation from the original direction.

A colony may achieve to a position with lower cost than the imperialist while moving toward the imperialist position. In this situation, the positions of them are swapped as shown in Fig. 7
                           . Subsequently, the algorithm will continue and the colonies will be moved toward imperialists in their new position.

The revolution process aims to change the socio-political features of a country suddenly after assimilation procedure. In this regard, a change may happen to the empire’s structure with a predefined revolution rate P
                           
                              IR
                           . Furthermore, in the revolution procedure, some of the colonies are selected and then two positions of the colony’s array are chosen and these positions are exchanged, so new countries are generated and some of the weakest colonies are replaced with these countries with revolution rate P

The power of the imperialist country plays a crucial role in the empire’s total power, while the power of the colonies of an empire has a diluted impact on the total power of that empire. The equation of the total cost is defined as follows:

All empires attempt to take the possession and control of colonies of other empires. To this end, the imperialistic competition causes a gradual decrease in the power of weaker empires and an increase in the power of more powerful ones. In other word, picking some (usually one) of the weakest colonies of the weakest empire and making a competition among all empires to possess these colonies are the goals of the imperialistic competition. Although these empires will be more likely to possess them, the most powerful empires will not definitely possess these colonies.

Subsequently, by merging the new population with the old one and by sorting the countries based on their accenting cost functions, a set of sorted countries is formed. Then a number of countries equal to the old population are selected, and the rest of them are eliminated. AICA pseudo code is illustrated in Fig. 10

VNS is considered is known as one of very popular local search methods, due to its ease of use and accomplishments in problem solving (Sevkli & Aydin, 2006). During VNS process, the local optimum in each neighborhood is found iteratively and hopefully reaches the global optimum at the end (Vahdani & Zandieh, 2010). A very complete study about VNS can be found in. (Hansen & Mladenović, 2001; Mladenovic & Hansen, 1997). This metaheuristic was successfully applied to solve various supply chain problems like network design. (Amrani, Martel, Zufferey, & Makeeva, 2011) and supply chain planning problems (Lejeune, 2006; Xiao, Kaku, Zhao, & Zhang, 2011). VNS algorithm begins with the initialization process, and then utilizes a set of neighborhood structures (NSs) symbolized by N
                           
                              ns
                            (ns
                           =1, 2, …, ns
                           max) to find the near-optimal solution, where ns
                           max indicates the maximum number of neighborhood types so their implementation sequence was determined previously. The quality of responses obtained in the VNS approach is heavily based on the efficiency of the developed NSs used in neighborhood search process. Consequently, we utilize a variety of types of NSs at different parts of solution separately to generate a new solution. In this regard, while VNS’s structure is not complex and it is easily used in variety of problems, the capability of this algorithm can be enhanced in each problem by designing streamlined NSs. This paper presents copious details regarding NS in both categories, ordinary NSs (as general NS) and directed NSs (designed especially for this paper) as follows:
                              
                                 •
                                 
                                    Ordinary neighborhood structures:
                                 

(a) Swap: two units of a solution are selected randomly and their positions are swapped. (b) Reversion: in addition to swap, units located between swapped units are reversed, too. (c) Insertion: the unit in the second position is located immediate after the unit in the first location and the other units are shifted to the right hand side accordingly (Rabiee, Zandieh, & Jafarian, 2012). (d) Max/min swap: the units with maximum and minimum values are chosen and their positions are exchanged. (e) Slide: two units of a solution are selected randomly. Following, the first unit is eliminated and the other units, located in between and second in number, are traversed to first position, and finally, the first number is placed in the second number position. (f) Exchange two neighbors (ETN): first two neighbor units of a solution are selected randomly, and subsequently positions of them are changed with each other. (g) Random shuffling (RS): a part of solution with predetermined number of subsequence is chosen, then values of its positions are exchanged with others (Vahdani & Zandieh, 2010). (h) Swapping a part of solution (SPS): with this NS, a subsequence of solutions is selected and then shifted to a new position. (i) Swapping a reversed part of solution (SRPS): this policy is like SPS, with this difference that during the moving process, the subsequence selected part of solution is reversed. The ordinary NSs in sub-solution facility selection are illustrated in Fig. 11

                                    Directed neighborhood structures:
                                    
                                       
                                          (I)
                                          
                                             NSs for facility selection sub-solution: (a) Eliminate semi-idle facility: a facility that has the lowest used capacity is closed and its load is allocated to other ones. (b) Adjusting facilities load: for a facility whose used capacity exceeds its maximum capacity, its overload is allocated to a semi-idle facility.


                                             NSs in shipment process: (a) Exchange the total demand (ETD): first two columns are randomly selected then they are exchanged with each other to change the required total demand by lower-hands. (b) Exchange the total supply (ETS): first two rows are randomly selected, then they are exchanged with each other to exchange total transships supplied by upper hand members. (c) Exchange a demand for two upper-hands (EDU): a random column is elected and two random positions are swapped. (d) Exchange a supply for two lower-hands (ESL): a random row is selected and two random positions in this row are swapped to change the supply source required from a specific upper hand member. (e) Exchange two positions randomly (ETR): two position of the transship matrix are selected randomly and swapped. (f) Elimination of a semi-idle supplier for a lower-hand (ESSL): first a column is chosen randomly then the lowest value that this member requires from whole of its upper hand members is changed to zero.

By hybridizing two metaheuristics, adapted imperialist competitive algorithm (AICA) and Variable neighborhood search algorithm (VNS), a novel algorithm named HIV is produced, described in this section. The aim of the design this hybrid algorithm is to combine the strengths of AICA and VNS in order to improve the efficiency of a single approach. HIV benefits from AICA as the main loop and VNS as the local search to improve imperialists. In this regard, this algorithm initializes with a random population and improves them iteratively by AICA. Then HIV uses imperialists as initial solution of VNS. Consequently, VNS tries to improve the imperialists by preserving the number of populations.

In this solution method, the problem is divided into two phases, strategic and operational (Ross & Jayaraman, 2008). The first one optimizes the strategic decisions such as opening the facilities, establishing technology at plants and assigning customers to retailers and collection/inspection centers. The first phase is run when there is a need to update the distribution network design. Strategic decisions are taken into account as a kind of decision that may affect the future direction of the company. These decisions are made only once during any given time period because of the strategic nature of the decision making process (Jayaraman & Ross, 2003). The second phase is related to executional or operational decisions (Jayaraman & Ross, 2003). In this phase, the operational decisions, that is, manufacturing products at plants, handling products at facilities, and shipment of products through the network are optimized. As illustrated in Fig. 12
                           , in the first phase, the strategic network is designed by AICA, and then in the next phase, the operational problem is handled by VNS. The benefit of this algorithm is to reduce the problem space and solution time by dividing the problem into two phases. While it might lose the solutions which are not good in the first phase, it may result in good solutions totally in both stages. The total objective is computed by the summation of both phases’ outputs.

In this method, the problem again is divided into two phases, strategic and operational, but as illustrated in Fig. 13
                           , the second phase is placed as a nested loop in the first phase. In other words, for each solution in the first phase, the second phase algorithm is executed. In this regard, for each design in the first phase, optimal operational solution will be grasped. Consequently, the strategic network is produced by AICA and then the operational problem is optimized by VNS for that design. This algorithm is able to optimize large-size problems profoundly through searching the problem space comprehensively. However, its run is time-consuming. In this way, NIV begins with the generation of a random solution and subsequent evaluation of this solution by VNS algorithm.

This paper tries to compare the proposed algorithms with other benchmark algorithms. In this regard, an experiment was conducted to analyze the performance of algorithms. Considering the numbers of potential units in each echelon that directly indicates the complexity of the problem, the problems are classified into three scales (i.e. small, medium, and large). In each scale, eight random problems are generated (i.e., a total of 24 test problems as illustrated in Fig. 14
                        ). The details of each generated problem are shown in Tables 4 and 5
                        
                        .

The demands of customers are generated by normal distribution N (100,20). The maximum desired number of units in each stage is half of its potential units. The fixed opening costs of facilities are estimated as a random as follows:

In this section, the quality of Pareto solutions generated by aforementioned methods is compared. In the 1990s, the methods were compared visually. However, in order to compare the methods fairly, we utilize four metrics which are introduced in Table 6

Proper setting of the parameters of metaheuristic algorithms leads to a high level of performance under diverse range of conditions (Shukla, Tiwari, Wan, & Shankar, 2010). Therefore, it results in more reliable and robust solutions. Parameter tuning can considerably increase the effectiveness and efficiency of an algorithm by finding better solutions and cutting the required time to find the solution. This study utilizes the Response Surface Method (RSM) developed by Box and Wilson (Myers, Montgomery, & Anderson-Cook, 1971) as an effective method in finding the optimal values of the parameters (Myers and Montgomery, 2002). RSM, as a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques, is one of the best techniques used for determining the values of metaheuristic algorithms parameters that are effective on algorithm performance. In this technique, each factor (X

As RSM can simultaneously analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of algorithms by estimating the appropriate parameters from the aspects of objective function (i.e., utopia line point) and CPU time, input variables are estimated to produce the desired response by a multiple objective decision-making problems (MCDM). In this way, we use an MODM model based on fuzzy interactive methods (Vahdani & Zandieh, 2010), utilized to estimate the parameters as follows:

In this paper, we compare the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithms by using the proposed metrics as comparison measures and CPU time. In this regard, to assess the efficiency of each algorithm and to analyze that if there is any significant difference among the performance of algorithms, firstly, the evaluation metrics (i.e., MID, SNS, POD and DEA) are calculated based on Pareto optimal solutions for all algorithms for each problem as illustrated in Table 9
                        . Moreover, to find out the best algorithm decisively, some statistical comparisons among the algorithms based on performance measures are conducted. Consequently, the results obtained for each problem are transformed to a relative deviation index (RDI) and reported. The RDI is obtained as follows:

                         due to nature of metrics. It is clear that the lower value of RDI is preferred. Then, in order to statistically analyze the effectiveness of algorithms, the Tukey’s confidence interval of 95% for the performance metrics in all algorithms is performed. It is noticeable that if there is an overlapping confidence interval between any two means, it will be concluded that there is no statistically significant difference between them (Naderi & Ruiz, 2010).

The means plot and least significant difference (LSD) intervals for all six algorithms are illustrated in Fig. 15
                        . With respect to Fig. 15(a), it can be seen that although there is no statistically significant difference between methods HIV and HGS in MID metric, both of them are more effective than others. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 15(b), it is clear that as NIV and NGS have overlapped areas, there is no meaningful priority between methods NIV and NGS in SNS metric, but both of them statistically outperform other approaches. In addition, Fig. 15(c) illustrates performance of the algorithms based on POD. From this metric perspective, NIV statistically outperforms all the other algorithms. Last but not least, according to Fig. 15(d), there are statistically significant differences among the approaches in DEA metric. According to DEA metric point of view, NIV statistically outperforms the other methods.


                        Fig. 16
                         demonstrates the non-dominated solutions of a single run which are obtained by algorithms in problem 6 as an example. To be clear, the illustration of the Pareto front is set to only 10. As it can be seen, the solutions obtained by NIV dominate the other algorithm solutions. In addition, to validate the statistical significance of the observed differences in the efficiency of methods, a means and interval plot for small, medium and large problems in terms of RID for CPU time is presented in Figs. 17–19
                        
                        
                        , respectively. The results show that in CPU time, TST was yielded to the better solutions. Also, in this section, we evaluate the sensitivity of problem size over the different algorithms based on 95% confidence interval and a scrutiny of the influences relative to the size of problems over the CPU time. With respect to Fig. 20
                        , the difference among algorithms in the amount of CPU time between P.1 and P.14 is inconsiderable, but after P.14 computational time of AICA has exponential growth.

To evaluate the usefulness and performance of the proposed model and NIV, a real case study is provided. The case is an Iranian glass producer which is planning to redesign its SCN and to develop a closed-loop network due to the increasing demand of its customers.

In this case problem, the suppliers are assumed as given while the flow of the raw material should be determined. The network has one active manufacturing center that can be relocated and three potential ones considered to be opened as new manufacturing center(s). In addition, there are three existing distribution centers and six potential locations which can be selected to serve twenty customer zones.

This closed-loop SCN includes: (1) suppliers which are assumed as given while the flow of the raw material should be determined; (2) manufacturing centers as the main part of the network including one currently operative and three potential locations identified as candidate sites for establishment; (3) distribution centers selected to serve these customers including two active distribution centers and five candidate locations (these companies may also distribute the productions of other industries); (4) twenty drink and food producers scattered throughout the country that use glasses as the customers of the network; and (5) at the reverse logistics, the collection inspection centers, recovering and recycling centers.

At the collection inspection centers, while a percentage of EOL products are disposed, the remainder is reused in two ways: (1) unbroken glasses are washed at recovering centers and redistributed through distribution centers and (2) broken glasses are shattered and washed at recycling centers and the raw material transferred to manufacturing centers. In this industry, two types of products, i.e. heavy and light glass, require two different types of technologies which are produced by different plants. Each of these plant types has special impact on the total economic and social performance of the SCN.

                     . It is noteworthy that the fixed opening cost and emission of active manufacturing and distribution centers are equal to zero. It should be mentioned that the Iranian Rial is considered as the monetary unit.

To solve this problem, the NIV algorithm, as the best proposed approach able to handle different sizes of sustainable closed-loop SCN design problem, is utilized. NIV is streamlined to be able to find a good approximation of Pareto front for the decision maker.

Accordingly, three extreme solutions among non-dominated solutions are estimated through constructing an associated payoff table for all objectives. In other words, the problem is solved separately for each objective function (f
                     
                        i
                     ) and the resultant best value is obtained to form the anchor points in the objective space

                      (Messac et al., 2003). Then, the problem is solved for each point and the Pareto front is finally obtained (Messac et al., 2003). In this section, to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach (i.e., the NIV algorithm), we not only utilized this method to solve the case problem, but also coded and solved the problem by GAMS.

                     . Due to the behavior of objective functions, when the weight of cost function increases, the centers with lower opening and operating costs are selected. However, increasing the weight of the cost objective results in an undesired increase in the environmental impacts (as illustrated in Fig. 21
                      (a)).

Regarding the social impacts, on the one hand, centers which require lower levels of opening costs create more job opportunities, both during opening and operating, compared to centers with state-of-the-art green technologies. On the other hand, increasing the weight of cost function leads to an increase in lost days and vice versa. Consequently, this decision is a double-edged sword for social aspects; it reduces or increases the number of job opportunities and the work’s damages simultaneously (as illustrated in Fig. 21 (b)).

In addition, according to Fig. 22
                     , the results show a conflict in the importance weight of objective function. In this regard, the best results are obtained when the weight of objective cost i.e. w
                     1 is set between 0.3 and 0.5, the weight of objective environmental effect i.e. w
                     2 is set between 0.15 and 0.35, and the weight of objective social aspect i.e. w
                     3 is determined between 0.3 and 0.4.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

In this paper, the inherent multi-dimensionality of sustainability was captured by proposing a multi-objective optimization model for a general closed-loop supply chain network with six echelons. The objectives were (1) minimization of total costs, (2) minimization of total environmental impacts, and (3) maximization of social benefits. The model consists of two levels: strategic and operational. To optimize this complex problem, three proposed approaches, constructed on two popular metaheuristics (adapted imperialist competitive algorithm (AICA) and Variable neighborhood search algorithm (VNS)) are: (1) HIV benefits from hybridizing AICA and VNS, (2) TIV by which the problem is optimized in two phases: strategic and operational, and (3) NIV in which the second phase algorithm, VNS, is placed as a nested loop in the first phase, ICA. In order to test the validity of the proposed algorithm, we generated some test problems. The performance and reliability of the proposed algorithms were evaluated in comparison with available benchmark algorithms (i.e. HGS, TST and NGS). For a fair comparison, all the algorithms’ parameters were estimated by response surface method (RSM) and MODM approach based on four different comparison metrics were proposed to validate the efficiency of the algorithms. The results obtained by the NIV algorithm almost dominate the results of other approaches; however, it needs more computational time.

A direct goal for further research is to assess the performance of the proposed method in other optimization problems. In addition, it can be engaging to model the inherent uncertainty of real cases. Another extension could be the inclusion of more real-life constraints like the cross-docking operations and vehicle routing practices which can reduce the transportation total cost by using the same facility in forward and reverse logistics and can also reduce the unused capacity of vehicles. Finally, a periodic timeline can be considered for the problem to analyze the decisions related to time such as backlogging, forecasting, and ordering.
