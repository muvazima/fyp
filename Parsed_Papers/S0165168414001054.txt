                  In this paper, we propose a musical-noise-free blind speech extraction method using a microphone array for application to nonstationary noise. In our previous study, it was found that optimized iterative spectral subtraction (SS) results in speech enhancement with almost no musical noise generation, but this method is valid only for stationary noise. The proposed method consists of iterative blind dynamic noise estimation by, e.g., independent component analysis (ICA) or multichannel Wiener filtering, and musical-noise-free speech extraction by modified iterative SS, where multiple iterative SS is applied to each channel while maintaining the multichannel property reused for the dynamic noise estimators. Also, in relation to the proposed method, we discuss the justification of applying ICA to signals nonlinearly distorted by SS. From objective and subjective evaluations simulating a real-world hands-free speech communication system, we reveal that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the past few decades, many applications of speech communication systems have been investigated, but it is well known that these systems always suffer from the deterioration of speech quality under adverse noise conditions. Spectral subtraction (SS) is a commonly used noise reduction method that has high noise reduction performance with low computational complexity [1–5]. However, in this method, artificial distortion, referred to as musical noise, arises owing to nonlinear signal processing, leading to a serious deterioration of sound quality. To achieve high-quality noise reduction with low musical noise, an iterative SS method has been proposed [6–8]. Also, some of the authors have reported the very interesting phenomenon that this method with appropriate parameters gives equilibrium behavior in the growth of higher-order statistics with increasing number of iterations [9]. This means that almost no musical noise is generated even with high noise reduction, which is one of the most desirable properties of single-channel nonlinear noise reduction methods. Following this finding, the authors have derived the optimal parameters satisfying the no-musical-noise-generation condition by analysis based on higher-order statistics. We have defined this method as musical-noise-free speech enhancement, where no musical noise is generated even for a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in iterative SS [10].

In conventional iterative SS, however, it is assumed that the input noise signal is stationary, meaning that we can estimate the expectation of noise power spectral density from a time-frequency period of a signal that contains only noise. In contrast, under real-world acoustical environments, such as a nonstationary noise field, although it is necessary to dynamically estimate noise, this is very difficult. Therefore, in this paper, firstly, we propose a new iterative signal extraction method using a microphone array that can be applied to nonstationary noise. Our proposed method consists of iterative blind dynamic noise estimation by independent component analysis (ICA) [11,12] and musical-noise-free speech extraction by modified iterative SS.

Secondly, in relation to the proposed method, we discuss the justification of applying ICA to signals nonlinearly distorted by SS. We theoretically clarify that the degradation in ICA-based noise estimation obeys an amplitude variation in room transfer functions between the target user and microphones. Next, to reduce speech distortion, we introduce a channel selection strategy into ICA, where we automatically choose less varied inputs to maintain the high accuracy of noise estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a time-variant noise power spectral density (PSD) estimator [13] instead of ICA to improve the noise estimation accuracy. From objective and subjective evaluations, we reveal that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe related works on SS and the musical noise metric. In Section 3, the new musical-noise-free blind speech extraction method is proposed. In Section 4, an improvement scheme for poor noise estimation is presented. In Section 5, objective and subjective evaluations are described. Following a discussion on the results of the experiments, we present our conclusions in Section 6.

In an attempt to achieve high-quality noise reduction with low musical noise, an improved method based on iterative SS was proposed in the previous studies [6–8]. This method is performed through signal processing, in which the following weak SS processes are recursively applied to the noise signal (see Fig. 1
                        ). (I) The average power spectrum of the input noise is estimated, (II) The estimated noise prototype is then subtracted from the input with the parameters specifically set for weak subtraction, e.g., a large flooring parameter η and a small subtraction parameter β and (III) we then return to step (I) and substitute the resultant output (partially noise reduced signal) for the input signal.

In this paper, we assume that the input signal X in the power spectral domain is modeled using the gamma distribution as

In [10], we proposed musical-noise-free noise reduction, where no musical noise is generated even for a high SNR in iterative SS. In the study, some of the authors discovered an interesting phenomenon that the kurtosis ratio sometimes does not change even after SS via mathematical analysis based on (11) 
                        [9]. This indicates that the kurtosis ratio can be maintained at unity even after iteratively applying SS to improve the NRR, and thus no musical noise is generated. Following this finding, the authors derived the optimal parameters satisfying the musical-noise-free condition by finding a fixed-point status in the kurtosis ratio, i.e., by solving

                         shows an example of the kurtosis ratio in optimized iterative SS, where Gaussian noise is assumed. We can confirm the flat trace of the kurtosis, indicating no musical noise generation.

In the previous section, we assumed that the input noise signal is stationary, meaning that we can estimate the expectation of a noise signal from a time-frequency period of a signal that contains only noise, i.e., speech absence. However, in actual environments, such as a nonstationary noise field, it is necessary to dynamically estimate the noise PSD.

To solve this problem, we previously proposed blind spatial subtraction array (BSSA) [15], which involves accurate noise estimation by ICA followed by a speech extraction procedure based on SS (see Fig. 3
                        ). BSSA improves the noise reduction performance, particularly in the presence of both diffuse and nonstationary noises; thus, almost all the environmental noise can be dealt with. However, BSSA always suffers from musical noise owing to SS. In addition, the output signal of BSSA degenerates to a monaural (not multichannel) signal, meaning that ICA cannot be reapplied; thus, we cannot iteratively estimate the noise power spectra. Therefore, it is impossible to directly apply iterative SS to the conventional BSSA.

In this section, we propose a new multi-iterative blind signal extraction method integrating iterative blind noise estimation by ICA and iterative noise reduction by SS. As mentioned previously, the conventional BSSA cannot iteratively and accurately estimate noise by ICA because the conventional BSSA performs a delay and sum (DS) operation before SS. To solve this problem, we propose a new BSSA structure that performs multiple independent SS in each channel before DS; we call this structure channelwise SS 
                        [16–18]. Using this structure, we can equalize the number of channels of the observed signal to that of the signals after channelwise SS. Therefore, we can iteratively apply noise estimation by ICA and speech extraction by SS (see Fig. 4
                        ). Also, the advantage of the proposed structure is that ICA has the possibility of adaptively estimating the distorted wavefront of a speech signal to some extent even after SS, because ICA is a blind signal identification method that does not require knowledge of the target signal direction. Details of this issue will be discussed in Section 3.3. Hereafter, we refer to this proposed BSSA as iterative BSSA.

We conduct iterative BSSA in the following manner, where the superscript [i] represents the value in the ith iteration of SS (initially i=0).

In this subsection, we discuss the accuracy of the estimated noise signal in each iteration of iterative BSSA. In actual environments, not only point-source noise but also non-point-source (e.g., diffuse) noise often exists. It is known that ICA is proficient in noise estimation rather than speech estimation under such a noise condition [15]. This is because the target speech can be regarded as a point-source signal (thus, the wavefront is static in each subband) and ICA acts as an effective blocking filter of the speech wavefront even in a time-invariant manner, resulting in good noise estimation. However, in iterative BSSA, we should address the inherent question of whether the distorted speech wavefront after nonlinear noise reduction such as SS can be blocked by ICA or not; thus, we determine whether the speech component after channelwise SS can become a point source again.

Hereafter, we quantify the degree of point-source-likeness for SS-applied speech signals. For convenience of discussion, a simple two-channel array model is assumed. First, we define the speech component in each channel after channelwise SS as

                         is fixed to 1.0). Note that the TFR is highly correlated to the room reverberation and the interelement spacing of the microphone array; we determined the range of the TFR by simulating a typical moderately reverberant room and the array with 2.15cm interelement spacing used in Section 5 (see the example of the TFR in Fig. 6
                        ). For the internal parameters used in iterative BSSA in this simulation, β and η are 8.5 and 0.9, respectively, which satisfy the musical-noise-free condition. In addition, the smallest value on the horizontal axis is 3dB in Fig. 5 because DS is still performed even when i=0.

From Fig. 5(a) and (b), which correspond to relatively high input SNRs, we can confirm that the degree of point-source-likeness, i.e., 
                           COS
                           (
                           f
                           )
                        , is almost maintained when the TFR is close to 1 even if the speech components are distorted by iterative BSSA. Also, it is worth mentioning that the degree of point-source-likeness is still above 0.9 even when the TFR is decreased to 0.4 and i is increased to 6. This means that almost 90% of the speech components can be regarded as a point source and thus can be blocked by ICA. In contrast, from Fig. 5(c), which shows the case of a low input SNR, when the TFR is dropped to 0.4 and i is more than 3, the degree of point-source-likeness is lower than 0.6. Thus, less than 60% of the speech components can be regarded as a point source, and this leads to poor noise estimation.

In this subsection, we propose a channel selection strategy in ICA for achieving high accuracy of noise estimation. As mentioned previously, speech distortion is subjected to 
                           ISNR
                           (
                           f
                           )
                         and 
                           TFR
                           (
                           f
                           )
                        , and the accuracy of noise estimation is degraded along with speech distortion. Fig. 6 shows typical examples of the TFR. From Fig. 6, we can confirm that the TFRs in different combinations of microphones are not the same in each frequency subband; at a specific frequency, one microphone pair has higher 
                           TFR
                           (
                           f
                           )
                         than another pair, and vice versa at another frequency. Thus, we are able to select an appropriate combination of microphones to obtain a higher TFR.

Therefore, we introduce the channel selection method into ICA in each frequency subband, where we automatically choose less varied inputs to maintain high accuracy of noise estimation. Hereafter, we describe the detail of the channel selection method. First, we calculate the average power of the observed signal

                         is the threshold for the selection.

Finally, we perform noise estimation based on ICA using the selected channels in each frequency subband, and we apply the projection back operation to remove the ambiguity of the amplitude and construct the estimated noise signal.

In the previous section, we revealed that the speech components cannot be regarded as a point source, and this leads to poor noise estimation in iterative BSSA. To solve this problem, we introduce a time-variant noise PSD estimator [13] instead of ICA to improve the noise estimation accuracy. This method has been developed for future high-end binaural hearing aids and performs a prediction of the left noisy signal from the right noisy signal via the Wiener filter, followed by an auto-PSD of the difference between the left noisy signal and the prediction. By applying the noise PSD estimated from this estimator to (19), we can perform speech extraction. The procedure of this noise PSD estimator is described in Appendix.

We conducted objective and subjective evaluation experiments to confirm the validity of the proposed methods under the diffuse and nonstationary noise condition. The size of the experimental room was

                         and the reverberation time was approximately 200ms. We used a two-, three-, or four-element microphone array with an interelement spacing of 2.15cm, and the direction of the target speech was set to be normal to the array. All the signals used in this experiment were sampled at 16kHz with 16-bit accuracy. The DFT size was 1024, and the frame shift length was 256. We used 5 male and 5 female speakers (one utterance per speaker) as sources of the original target speech signal. The input SNR was −5, 0, 5, and 10dB.

We conducted an objective experimental evaluation under the same NRR condition. First, Figs. 7–10
                        
                        
                        
                         show the kurtosis ratio and cepstral distortion obtained from the experiments with real traffic noise and railway station noise, where we evaluate 10-dB NRR (i.e., output SNRs=5, 10, 15, and 20dB) signals processed by five conventional methods, namely, the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) short-time spectral amplitude (STSA) estimator [19], the Log MMSE estimator incorporating speech-presence uncertainty [20], single-channel musical-noise-free iterative spectral subtraction, the multichannel speech enhancement method integrating the minimum variance beamformer and the Log MMSE estimator for postfiltering, and BSSA, in addition to our proposed methods of iterative BSSA (using ICA or a time-variant noise estimator with/without channel selection). Here, we did not apply the channel selection method to the two-microphone case because ICA or time-variant noise estimation requires at least two-channel signals. Also, we applied a minimum statistics noise PSD estimator [5] to the MMSE STSA estimator and musical-noise-free iterative spectral subtraction, and we use the decision-directed approach for a priori SNR estimation in the MMSE STSA estimator and the log MMSE estimator. From Figs. 7 and 9, we can confirm that the iterative BSSA methods outperform the MMSE STSA estimator, the Log MMSE estimator, and the conventional BSSA in terms of kurtosis ratio. In particular, the kurtosis ratios of the proposed methods are mostly close to 1.0. This means that the proposed iterative methods did not generate any musical noise. However, the iterative BSSA methods lead to greater speech distortion compared with the conventional BSSA (see Figs. 8 and 10). Therefore, a trade-off exists between the amount of musical noise generation and speech distortion in the conventional BSSA and iterative BSSA methods. This result implies the disadvantage of iterative BSSA, i.e., large speech distortion, which has been theoretically predicted in Section 3.3. However, since the speech distortion of the proposed iterative BSSA with channel selection is lower than that of the original iterative BSSA, we can confirm the validity of the channel selection method.

Next, Fig. 11
                         shows the cepstral distortion separated by gender for each type of noise. Note that the cepstral distortion in Fig. 11 is the average for all input SNRs. From Fig. 11, we cannot confirm a variation in the cepstral distortion of the proposed method despite the gender differences.

Since we found the above-mentioned trade-off, we next conducted a subjective evaluation for setting the performance competition. In the evaluation, we presented a pair of 10-dB NRR signals processed by the conventional BSSA and four of our proposed iterative BSSAs (using ICA or a time-variant noise estimator with/without channel selection) in random order to 10 examinees, who selected which signal they preferred from the viewpoint of total sound quality, e.g., less musical noise, less speech distortion, and so forth.

The result of this experiment is shown in Fig. 12
                         for (a) traffic noise and (b) railway station noise. It is found that the output signals of some iterative BSSAs are preferred to that of the conventional BSSA, indicating the higher sound quality of the proposed method in terms of human perception. This result is plausible because humans are often more sensitive to musical noise than to speech distortion as indicated in the past studies, e.g., [21].

To visually understand the above-mentioned result, Fig. 13
                         shows part of the spectrograms of (a) a clean signal, (b) an observed signal, (c) a signal extracted by BSSA, and (d) a signal extracted by iterative BSSA, where the input SNR is set to 5dB with real traffic noise and the NRR is 10dB. From Fig. 13, it is confirmed that iterative BSSA reduces the number of isolated components in time-frequency domain sequences, which is a factor contributing to musical noise, compared with BSSA. Also, there are no major differences in the speech components of the clean signal, the signal processed by BSSA, and the signal processed by iterative BSSA; thus, we can conclude that the intelligibility of iterative BSSA is no less than that of BSSA.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we addressed a musical-noise-free blind speech extraction method using a microphone array that can be applied to nonstationary noise. Firstly, we proposed iterative BSSA using a new BSSA structure, which generates almost no musical noise even with increasing noise reduction performance.

Secondly, in relation to the proposed method, we discussed the justification of applying ICA to signals nonlinearly distorted by SS. We theoretically clarified that the degradation in ICA-based noise estimation obeys an amplitude variation in room transfer functions between the target user and microphones. Therefore, we proposed the introduction of a channel selection strategy in ICA and a time-variant noise PSD estimator to improve the noise estimation accuracy.

Finally, from the objective evaluation experiments, we confirmed a trade-off between the amount of musical noise generation and speech distortion in the conventional and iterative BSSA. However, in a subjective preference test, iterative BSSA obtained a higher preference score than the conventional BSSA. Thus, iterative BSSA is advantageous to the conventional BSSA in terms of sound quality.
