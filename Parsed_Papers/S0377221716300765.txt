                     Bensolve is an open source implementation of Benson’s algorithm and its dual variant. Both algorithms compute primal and dual solutions of vector linear programs (VLP), which include the subclass of multiple objective linear programs (MOLP). The recent version of Bensolve can treat arbitrary vector linear programs whose upper image does not contain lines. This article surveys the theoretical background of the implementation. In particular, the role of VLP duality for the implementation is pointed out. Some numerical examples are provided. In contrast to the existing literature we consider a less restrictive class of vector linear programs.

The recent version of Bensolve assumes further that the cone C is solid, i.e., it has dimension q, or equivalently, nonempty interior. This assumption is equivalent to 
                        
                           rank
                           Y
                           =

                     . Further, C is free of lines if and only if 
                        
                           rank

                     . This implies that necessarily o ≥ q and p ≥ q.

We close this section with some bibliographical remarks. It seems that Dauer (1987) and Dauer and Liu (1990) started to propagate the objective space approach in multiple objective linear programming, saying that on the one hand it is more efficient, and on the other hand it is sufficient in practice to generate only the minimal (or non-dominated) vertices in the objective space (or image space). The algorithms of Bensolve are based on the papers by Benson (1998a), (1998b). Since then, several extensions, simplifications and improvements have been published, among them the introduction of a dual algorithm in Ehrgott, Löhne, and Shao (2012), the extension to the unbounded case in Löhne (2011), approximate variants in Shao and Ehrgott (2008), the extension to pointed solid polyhedral ordering cones in Hamel, Löhne, and Rudloff (2014), a simplification which requires only one LP per iteration (independently) in Csirmaz (2015) and Hamel et al. (2014), and a complexity analysis in Bökler and Mutzel (2015). Recently, it was shown that Bensolve can be used to compute projections of polyhedra (Löhne & Weißing, 2015). In contrast to the literature, see e.g. Hamel et al. (2014), we make weaker assumptions: The geometric duality parameter vector 
                        
                           c
                           ∈
                           
                              R
                              q
                           
                        
                      is required to satisfy cq
                      ≠ 0 rather than 
                        
                           
                              c
                              q
                           
                           =
                           1
                        
                     . The choice of ordering cones is therefore less restricted. Moreover, we derive geometric dual programs for maximization problems as well as for problems with box constraints.

In contrast to most classical textbooks on vector optimization and multiple objective programming, Bensolve is based on a recent solution concept, which has been introduced in Heyde and Löhne (2011) and Löhne (2011). This concept entails the notions of minimality and infimum attainment, which are equivalent in the scalar linear programming case, but do diverge with increasing image space dimension. While in the classical literature essentially only minimality is taken into account, we will show in the following that both conceptions are essential for a proper solution concept. To this end, we start with the classical scalar theory and extend it to the case of multiple image space dimensions.

The generalization of minimality to higher image space dimension with respect to the ordering induced by C is a standard notion:

The generalization of the term ‘solution’, however, is not so obvious. Likewise to the scalar case, a solution to a problem should be a single entity. But, a single minimizer is not an appropriate solution, even though it is referred to as efficient solution in the classical literature. The reason is that a single minimizer can be obtained by solving a scalarized problem, which in the present setting is usually a linear program. The problem to determine a single minimizer is therefore a matter of scalar optimization. Thus, the single entity mentioned above should be a set of minimizers.

The problem to compute all extreme minimizers has been investigated, see Evans and Steuer (1973), Steuer (1989), but for many applications, this approach does not seem to be tractable. This can be seen already by considering the scalar case: The problem to compute all extreme minimizers (i.e. a representation of all solutions) of a linear program is NP hard: Consider the feasibility problem. This leads to vertex enumeration, which is NP hard, see e.g. (Dyer, 1983, Proposition 5).


                     Dauer (1987) and many followers aimed at characterizing every minimal element in the objective space. A corresponding set of minimizers is what we understand to be a solution to a vector linear program. Surprisingly this idea can be defined via infimum attainment.

Let us consider the scalar case first. An alternative characterization of a solution for (LP), which does not rely on minimality, is provided by means of infimum attainment: The image

Here, we focus on the practical implications the consideration of the upper image yields. Observe that the right hand side of inequality (3) describes all the information in the image space that matters for a solution to (LP): While the image c[S] may be a closed interval

We note here that minimality is a kind of “local” property, whereas infimum attainment characterizes the relevant parts of the image of (VLP) “as a whole.” A solution to (VLP) combines both conceptions:

It is imperative, of course, that no minimal point is lost during the transition from the image P[S] to the upper image

The preceding proposition shows that for obtaining a solution to (VLP) it is sufficient to find the vertices Px and minimal extreme directions Pxh
                      of the upper image as well as preimages x ∈ S, xh
                      ∈ Sh
                      which generate them. In fact, this is how Bensolve works: A vertex representation of the upper image is found along with corresponding preimages for the vertices and minimal directions. Actually, Bensolve does even more: The V-representation found by Bensolve is irreducible, that is, if any element of the solution is left out, it will not generate the upper image 
                        P
                      in the sense of (6).

Those extremal directions in the V-representation which are not minimal (namely those belonging to C) are not a part of the solution, but nevertheless they are necessary for a complete description of the upper image. To emphasize their significance, these directions are labeled specifically:

                        Definition 9
                        The set of extreme directions of 
                              P
                            belonging to C is called cone compartment.

Duality plays an important role for Bensolve. For the user of the software the following aspects are important:

                        
                           (i)
                           The extended image 
                                 D
                               of the dual problem contains information about the extended image 
                                 P
                               of the primal problem: Bensolve outputs a V-representation of 
                                 
                                    D
                                    ,
                                 
                               which can be used to obtain an H-representation of 
                                 P
                              . Likewise, an H-representation of 
                                 D
                               can be obtained from the V-representation of 
                                 P
                               computed by Bensolve.

A dual algorithm can be chosen, which can be advantageous for certain problem instances. The dual algorithm constructs an outer and inner approximation of 
                                 D
                               which corresponds, by duality, to an inner and outer approximation of 
                                 P
                              .

A duality parameter vector 
                                 
                                    c
                                    ∈
                                    
                                       R

                               can be chosen by the user. The dual problem and the dual solution (but not the primal problem and primal solution) depend on this vector. It has influence on numerical issues of both the primal and the dual algorithm.

                     In addition to weak and strong duality, for details see e.g. Löhne (2011), there is a third type of duality relation, called geometric duality. It states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the proper faces of the polyhedron 
                        P
                      and the non-vertical (i.e. the last component of the corresponding normal vector does not vanish) proper faces of the polyhedron 
                        D
                     . The dimension of a proper face of 
                        P
                      and the dimension of the corresponding face of 
                        D
                      add up to 
                        
                           q
                           −

                     . In particular, facets (

The next theorem is a consequence of the geometric duality theorem (Heyde & Löhne, 2008, Theorem 3.1). It points out the facts relevant for users of Bensolve and does not aim to cover the complete idea of geometric duality. For simplicity, we assume that 
                        P
                      has a vertex, which corresponds exactly to the setting of the recent version of Bensolve (Löhne & Weißing, 2015).

Statement (i) follows from Corollary 3.3 in Heyde and Löhne (2008) and Theorem 4.62 in Löhne (2011). One has to take into account the following facts: (a) If a polyhedron P has a vertex, then an irredundant V-representation of P consists exactly of all vertices and all extreme directions of P, see e.g. Schrijver (1986); (b) Every vertex of 
                              P
                            is weakly minimal (and even minimal), see e.g. (Löhne, 2011, Corollary 4.67); (c) The vertical facets are exactly the ones which are not K-maximal, see e.g. (Löhne, 2011, Lemma 4.60).

Statement (ii) follows from Corollary 3.2 in Heyde and Löhne (2008) and the following facts: (d) 
                              D
                            has a vertex, see (Heyde & Löhne, 2008, Lemma 5.2), hence an irredundant V-representation of 
                              D
                            consists of its vertices and extreme directions; (e) every proper face and hence any facet of 
                              P
                            is weakly minimal, see e.g. (Heyde & Löhne, 2008, Lemma 5.6).□

                      ≠ 0, the dual problem of (VLP) is the following vector linear program with ordering cone

                           . In the dual problem we substitute

                     Bensolve is an implementation of primal and dual Benson-type algorithms. The origin of these algorithms is discussed in Section 1. The implementation is closely related to the presentation in Hamel et al. (2014), therefore, we do not present too much details here. Bensolve can handle problems which are generalized in comparison to Hamel et al. (2014) with respect to the following two aspects:

                        
                           (i)
                           The assumption 
                                 
                                    
                                       c
                                       q
                                    
                                    =
                                    1
                                 
                               can be replaced by cq
                               ≠ 0, which allows to use arbitrary solid and line-free polyhedral ordering cones.

Maximization is covered in addition to minimization.

These generalizations can be easily realized by the transformations and the dual programs discussed in the previous section. A modification of the algorithms is not necessary.

The VLP-solver Bensolve is a C-implementation of the algorithms discussed above. In this section, we investigate and compare numerical properties of two applications of multiobjective optimization problems.

The first example (Example 13) is used to show the improvements that could be made in comparison to prior implementations. The second problem class (Example 14) with image space dimension equal to ten shows that Bensolve is well suited for problems with high image space dimensions.

The numerical examples were run on a computer with 8 gigabyte memory and an Intel® Core™ i5-4200 CPU with 1.60 gigahertz clock. The source code of Bensolve

                      was compiled with the GNU Compiler Collection gcc 5.2.1 and linked against the GNU Linear Programming Kit library libglp 4.55.

                        Example 13
                        In their paper, Shao and Ehrgott (2008), Shao and Ehrgott use a variant of Benson’s algorithm to solve MOLPs originating from a model for optimizing radiotherapy treatment planning. The clinical example (PL) from this paper has three objectives, 1211 constraints and 595 variables (which are additionally nonnegative). The constraint matrix is sparse with 153936 nonzeros, see Fig. 1
                           . Solving this problem exactly is not tractable. Thus, an approximation variant of Benson’s algorithm has been introduced in Shao and Ehrgott (2008): The algorithm stops as soon as the translation of an approximation

                           . The major difference is the use of a certain warm start heuristic in Hamel et al. (2014). Approximations for various error-levels ε were computed with both the primal and dual variant of Bensolve

                           , were we used the primal simplex as LP-solver in both cases. The run times are listed and compared with those of the implementation from Hamel et al. (2014) in Table 1
                           . It can be seen that Bensolve performs superior to the preceding implementation with regard to the run times. This might be explained partially by the speed-up gained through the transition from a Matlab® to a C-based implementation or by refinements in the algorithm itself. It should be noted that even better results are expected as soon as a warm start heuristic similar to the one used in Hamel et al. (2014) is implemented. Currently, a kind of “indirect” warm start technique is used, which is imminent in the LP-solver

                            we use for our implementation: between subsequent calls to the solver, the basis factorization of the solution found last remains in memory, hence speeding up the computation time due to the similar structure of the LP’s.

A further explanation for the improved run times is the utilization of a variant of the double description method (see e.g. Fukuda & Prodon, 1996), adapted specifically for the vertex enumeration part of Bensolve: In each iteration we are given an H-representation and a V-representation of a polyhedron P. We intend to compute the intersection P ∩ H of P with an affine halfspace H. We assume that only a few vertices of P do not belong to H. The classical variant requires a classification of vertices K
                           1 of P belonging to H and vertices K
                           2 of P not belonging to H. The adjacency relation for every pair (v
                           1, v
                           2), where v
                           1 ∈ K
                           1 and v
                           2 ∈ K
                           2, needs to be checked in order to compute the new V-representation. The new variant avoids this classification. One starts with some v
                           1 ∈ K
                           1 and checks every neighboring vertex v
                           2 whether it belongs to K
                           2 or not. If not, the procedure is repeated with v
                           2.

                            in a reasonable amount of time. Additionally, an improvement with respect to the approximation quality can be observed: both the primal and dual variants of Bensolve are able to achieve approximations of the upper image with the same approximation error ε with fewer vertices (compare Table 2
                           ) and by solving less linear programs (Table 3
                           ). This behavior can be explained by a new implementation of the vertex enumeration: If two vertices are very close to each other, they are replaced by a single one, while maintaining the outer approximation property.

In Csirmaz (2015) Csirmaz presents a rather fascinating application of Benson’s algorithm: Exploring the entropy region formed by the entropies of the nonempty subsets of four random variables, which consists basically in finding a V-representation of a 10-dimensional projection of a high dimensional polytope. Csirmaz used a revised version of Benson’s algorithm to solve several instances of vector linear programs, which are generated by a procedure involving so called “copy steps”. The problem instances have been solved with Bensolve

                            and we compared the run times with those of Csirmaz (2015) (compare Table 4
                           ). Here we used the default options of Bensolve, the primal algorithm was used with an approximation error of

                                 =
                                 
                                    10

                           . Although we used a machine with slightly higher specifications than the one used in Csirmaz (2015), our implementation seems to be much faster, especially for large problem instances. One explanation might be the adapted vertex enumeration method used in Bensolve: In Csirmaz (2015) it is stated that due to the huge number of vertices of intermediate polytopes the vertex enumeration (the double description method) becomes the bottleneck of the algorithm. It should be noted that Csirmaz (2015) put a lot of effort in reducing numerical errors to a minimum. Therefore, we also list the number of vertices and facets computed by the different implementations in Table 5
                           . While the number of primal vertices concur for all problem instances, the number of dual vertices (which corresponds to the number of facets of the upper image) differs slightly for different instances. This may be the result of numerical errors or imprecision due to the approximating character of Benson’s algorithm.
