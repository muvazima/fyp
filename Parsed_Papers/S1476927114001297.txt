                  In this study, the structural and dynamic properties of two major porins (OmpF and OmpC) in Escherichia coli are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Both porins have the extracellular loop L3 folded halfway through the pore to form a constriction area. The solute influx and efflux are controlled by the L3 movement. E296 and D312 in OmpF and homologous D299 and D315 in OmpC located on the barrel wall are found to play a key role in L3 gating activity. All possible charged states of both E296(D299) and D312(315) are applied in this study to observe changes in overall structure and especially L3 movement. The results show that different protonation states of both residues cause the large-scale deviations in structure and pore cavity especially in OmpF. Fully charged E296(D299) and D312(315) increase the protein flexibility significantly. Deprotonating at least one of E296(D299) and D312(315) helps to fasten L3 to the barrel wall and maintain pore size. Lacking of interactions with D312(315) can lead to the pore closure in OmpF. Comparing with OmpC, not only is OmpF less stable, but it is also more sensitive to the charge states of both E296(D299) and D312(315).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Porins are water-filled pore-forming proteins that reside in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. They control the influx and efflux of nutrients and metabolites (Malek and Maghari, 2007; Nikaido, 2003). Especially, porins also serve as an entryway for many antibiotics (Basle et al., 2004; Alcaraz et al., 2004; Saint et al., 1996; Schulz, 2002; Kojima and Nikaido, 2013; Nestorovich et al., 2003; Todt et al., 1992; Bonvin et al., 2000). Most porins are homotrimers and are extremely stable in a wide range of pH, organic solvents, chaotropic salts, and detergents (Phale et al., 1998). The most conspicuous structural aspect of the trimeric porins is the presence of the constriction region or ‘eyelet’ located within the hourglass-shaped channel which is lined with charged residues. This feature is conserved in general diffusion porins and is found to be important physiologically (Kindal et al., 2002). One of the most studied porins is the outer membrane protein F (OmpF) from Escherichia coli. It consists of 16 antiparallel β strands connected by turns at the periplasmic side and loops at the extracellular side (Cowan et al., 1995; Cowan et al., 1992; Hoenger et al., 1993; Darden et al., 1993; Im and Roux, 2002a; Miedema et al., 2006; Varma et al., 2006). One of the loops (L3) is folded into the lumen in each monomer. This folded L3 creates a constriction area halfway through the pore Fig. 1
                     .

In this constriction site, a strong electric field is present due to the acidic residues on L3 and the basic residues on the opposite barrel wall. This strong electric field is essential for a pore conductance. Besides, there is the so-called latching loop (L2) reaching over to the neighbouring monomers to stabilize a trimeric form.

These structural features are also conserved in the outer membrane protein C (OmpC). OmpC shares 77% sequence similarity to OmpF and it shows similar porin architecture and secondary structure element (Kumar et al., 2010). Key residues for structure and function found in OmpF are also conserved in OmpC. Despite very similar structure, OmpC is found somewhat more cation selective and has smaller pore size (Nikaido, 2003; Nikaido, 2003). Besides, OmpC is less voltage sensitive therefore it requires higher voltage for pore closure (Schulz, 2002; Saint et al., 1996). Thus, OmpC is preferentially expressed under extreme conditions (e.g., high temperature, toxic agents, or osmolarity), whereas OmpF is repressed (Forst et al., 1989). Moreover, both porins also show different characteristics in solute uptake (Saint et al., 1996), but the origin of these differences is not well understood.

OmpF have been widely studied since the 20th century. Some key residues for both trimer stability and transport function were identified. For example, a series of saltbridges, E71(from adjacent monomer)-R100 and E71-R132, was found to involve in trimer stability (the locations of these residues are shown in Fig. 6) (Liu and Delcour, 1998a; Liu et al., 2000; Phale et al., 1998; Varma et al., 2006). Moreover, the effects of constriction loop L3 on pore gating activity are also of interest (Benz et al., 1985; Cowan et al., 1992; Im and Roux, 2002b; Karshikoff et al., 1994). The movement of L3 was found to play a role in ion selectivity and pore cavity (Im and Roux, 2002b; Karshikoff et al., 1994). Based on the crystal structure (Cowan et al., 1992), The tip of L3 is expected to interact with the opposite barrel wall via hydrogen bonds involving E117 on L3 and 2 other residues E296 and D312 on the adjacent wall (see Fig. 6 for locations). Several OmpF experiments revealed that D312 and E296 on the opposite barrel wall are crucial for L3 flexibility (Basle et al., 2006; Cowan et al., 1992; Karshikoff et al., 1994; Liu and Delcour, 1998a). All key residues for both structure and function are also conserved in OmpC as seen in Fig. 1E. Like OmpF, OmpC employs L3 for gating activity. Based on key residues found for trimer stability and function, the electrostatic interactions seem to be the major driving force. Therefore, the charge states of key ionisable residues become important. Previous pK
                     a calculations of OmpF indicated the uncommon charge states of important residues such as E296 and D312 (Karshikoff et al., 1994). Many studies suggested possible charged states of the two residues. Initially, both E296 and D312 were computationally found to be protonated at physiological pH (Im and Roux, 2002b; Karshikoff et al., 1994; Miedema et al., 2006; Alcaraz et al., 2009; Tieleman and Berendsen, 1998; Schirmer and Phale, 1999; Humphrey et al., 1996). Later, protonating either E296 or D312 and deprotonating both residues were also employed in some simulations (Varma et al., 2006; van der Straaten et al., 2002; Biro et al., 2010). Nonetheless, based on a previous patch clamp study, deprotonating D312 only becomes more reasonable (Liu and Delcour, 1998a). The patch clamp work revealed that the D315A mutation in OmpC (D315 is homologous to D312 in OmpF) resulted in an increase in the frequency of pore closures. This indicates the key role of charged D315 on tethering L3 to the opposite wall. Hence, it is thought that homologous D312 in OmpF should act in the same manner. To date, it seems that the suitable charge states of the two residues and especially clear molecular details responding to different protonation states remain obscure. So, this study aims at understanding the structural responses when all possible protonation states of E296(D299) and D312(D315) are applied in both OmpF and OmpC (the residue number in a bracket represents the homologous residue number of OmpC). The differences in structure and dynamics (especially the trimeric stability and L3 motion) affected by different protonation states of the two are investigated.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used in a number of earlier studies to investigate the dynamic properties of OmpF. A 1ns MD study of the trimeric OmpF revealed deviations of dynamical structure relative to the crystal structure. It also showed that L3 flexibility affected a change in pore cavity (Humphrey et al., 1996). MD simulations were also successfully used to observe the solute (such as antibiotics) passage through OmpF in comparison with experiments (Malek and Maghari, 2007; Kumar et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2013; Ziervogel and Roux, 2013; Mahendran et al., 2010). OmpF are computationally well studied whereas few computational studies on OmpC are found. Recently, the accelerated MD has revealed the antibiotic permeations through both OmpC and OmpF (Kumar et al., 2010). They observed the more extended but narrower constriction area and the more antibiotic specificity of OmpC (Kumar et al., 2010). Furthermore, MD simulations were used to study the influence of protonation states of titratable residues on the OmpF function (Im and Roux, 2002a; Im and Roux, 2002b; Varma et al., 2006; van der Straaten et al., 2003; Berendsen et al., 1984). It appears that key aspects of the protein behavior can be captured on the MD timescale. Therefore, MD simulations are employed in this study to examine the effect of different protonation states of E296 and D312 (homologous to D299 and D315 in OmpC) on trimer stability and L3 activity in both porins in atomic level. This study has no intention to predict the suitable charge states for the two key residues. It is aimed at understanding the nature of OmpF and OmpC in microscopic detail when some unusual charged residues suggested from previous studies are applied. This study may partially reflect the structural responses from both porins at different pH.

The trimeric OmpC (2J1N, resolution 2.0Å) and OmpF (2OMF, resolution 2.4Å) crystal structures consisting of 346 and 340 amino acids in each monomer respectively were used in this study. The charges of E296 and D312 in OmpF and D299 and D315 in OmpC were set separately, whereas the rest ionisable residues were set as a common state at physiological pH. All possible protonation states of E296(D299) and D312(315) were set in this study. These 4 different protonation states for both porins were: (i) fully charged E296(D299) and D312(315) (NP); (ii) protonated E296(D299) and charged D312(315) (P299); (iii) protonated D312(315) and charged E296(D299) (P315); (iv) protonated E296(D299) and D312(315) (P299–315). Overall, each porin was set into 4 simulations with different protonation states of E296(D299) and D312(315). Each system was embedded in a pre-equilibrated dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer (pre-equilibrated by running a 2ns simulation). The solvent-accessible molecular surface of both OmpC and OmpF were used as templates to remove lipids and perform short steered MD simulations of the solvated proteins as described in detail by Faraldo-Gomez et al. (Faraldo-Gomez et al., 2002). This generated a cavity into which proteins were inserted. Water and counter ions were then added into each system. Ions were added by replacing selected water molecules. For each system, a 0.2ns equilibration of protein restrained dynamics simulation was conducted with a force constant of 1000 kJmol−1
                        nm−2, followed by a 10ns unrestrained MD production run.

All simulations were performed using the GROMACS 4 simulation package (www.gromacs.org) (Lindahl et al., 2001) with an extended united atom version of the GROMOS96 forcefield (Bonvin et al., 2000). To relax steric conflicts generated during setup, all energy minimizations used up to 1000 steps of steepest descent. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method (Darden et al., 1993) with a short range cutoff of 1nm, a Fourier spacing of 0.12nm, and fourth-order spline interpolation. All simulations were performed in the constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature (NPT) ensemble. The temperature of the protein, DMPC, solvent, and ions were each coupled separately using the Berendsen thermostat (Berendsen et al., 1984) at 300K with a coupling constant τ
                        t
                        =0.1ps. The pressure was coupled using the Berendsen algorithm at 1bar with a coupling constant τ
                        p
                        =1ps. The time step for integration was 2fs. Coordinates were saved every 2ps for subsequent analysis. To check the consistency of all simulations, 2 samples of OmpF and OmpC runs were extended to 25ns. No major change was observed.

The results were analyzed by GROMACS and locally written code. Molecular graphic images were prepared using VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996). All results shown here are an average among all monomers.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Overall, the RMSDs, calculated on alpha carbons, demonstrate that the barrel wall of OmpC is more stable than that of OmpF. Importantly, different protonation states of E296 (D299 in OmpC) and D312 (D315 in OmpC) do influence the structural stability, especially in fully charged E296(D299) and D312(D315) (NP). However, this protonation variation appears to have more impact on loop stability. The high RMSDs of NP clearly indicate the increase in protein fluctuation in both porins (Fig. 2
                        ; blue line). Especially, L8 in both porins, L2 and L3 in OmpC, and L1 and L6 in OmpF appear to be more mobile (Fig. 2). As evident from the plot, NP appears to generate the large-scale deviation in such loop regions. On the other hand, when either D312(315) or E296(D299) gets uncharged, the small fluctuated RMSDs are observed. This finding clearly displays the significance of protonated states of the two acidic residues on protein stability. The result agrees well with previous studies (Karshikoff et al., 1994; Liu and Delcour, 1998a; Gallivan and Dougherty, 1999). Fully charged NP seems to enhance protein flexibility significantly. Considering L3 flexibility, only NP in OmpC can promote an increase in L3 movement, whereas for OmpF, NP and P299–315 cause more mobile L3 (Fig. 2). Not only do different protonation states of E296(D299) and D312(315) contribute to the deviations of L3 flexibility, but they also influence the overall structural stability. To maintain structure stability in both porins, the results clearly demonstrate that at least one of E296(D299) and D312(315) should be left uncharged.

Considering the flexibility of individual regions, L4 in OmpC is found to be the most fluctuated in all monomers (Figs. 2 and 3
                        ). L4 in OmpC is 14-amino acids longer than OmpF. This extended length can cause the larger fluctuation (RMSD ∼0.2nm and RMSF ∼0.3–0.4nm). This finding was also observed by others (Kumar et al., 2010; Varma and Jakobsson, 2004). The interesting difference between OmpC and OmpF is the fluctuations of L7 and L8. Unlike OmpC, L7 (1-amino acid shorter) and L8 (3-amino acid shorter) in OmpF show unexpected behavior. The RMSDs display the unexpectedly much more rigid L7 in OmpF (∼0.05nm for OmpF and ∼0.1nm for OmpC), whereas L8 shows the larger fluctuation when compared with that of OmpC (∼0.15–0.30nm), especially in NP (Fig. 2). Previous studies suggested that L8 might be a part of voltage gating or pH sensitivity (Basle et al., 2004; Benz et al., 1985; Delcour, 2003). So, the large fluctuation of L8 in OmpF may reflect the more susceptibility of OmpF to voltage and pH. Among monomers, RMSF analysis indicates the non-identical protein flexibility of each subunit. Each of them seems to behave individually. Some different patterns of loop fluctuations in each monomer can be observed.

Not only do different protonation states of D312(315) and E296(D299) impact on overall protein flexibility, they also influence the pore size. Since both E296(D299) and D312(315) are involved in the hydrogen-bonding network for L3-wall attachment, especially D312(315) (Karshikoff et al., 1994; Varma and Jakobsson, 2004), the diverse charged states of such residues should directly affect changes in pore size. In OmpF, the pore dimensions are varied based on different protonation states of D312 and E296. The pore profiles are shown in Fig. 4
                        . OmpC has the average pore radius of ∼0.25nm, while OmpF has a spectrum of pore radii ranging from 0.22nm to 0.3nm (Fig. 4B and C). It is clear that OmpF has a larger pore size in average where the widest is obtained in P315 and the smallest is in NP (Fig. 4C). The obvious pore reduction in NP may be a sign for pore closure in OmpF. The number of hydrogen bonds between L3 and the rest of the protein appears to be a good indicator to show how tight L3 binds to the wall. NP in OmpF generates the lowest number of hydrogen bonds (∼18 hydrogen bonds) which is no doubt why it gives the narrowest pore, whilst ∼23 hydrogen bonds are found in P315 leading to tight-bound L3 on its adjacent wall and consequently the largest pore cavity (Fig. 4E). The OmpF pore size can be categorized as: NP<P299–315<P299<P315. For OmpF, it is no doubt that the charged states of D312 and E296 truly affect the pore cavity. On the other hand, the pore radii of OmpC are frozen to ∼0.25nm although various protonation states of D315 and D299 are applied. The charge variations of D315 and D299 in OmpC seem to have minute impact on pore cavity. The pore size of OmpC is preserved by ∼22 hydrogen bonds even though it is below 20 at 5–7ns for NP (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, double-site deprotonation (NP) seems to promote a pore closure in OmpF, while it shows insignificant effect in OmpC. The variations of pore cavity when different charged states are applied may reflect the more pH-sensitive properties of OmpF.

To better understand the effects of protonation states of E296(D299) and D312(315) on structure and function, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to C-alpha atoms in all cases to observe the protein motion. The analysis shows that the first eigenvector accounts for majority of all motions (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary information). Based on the first eigenvector, the motion of L3 and wall is captured as time-dependent cartoons in Fig. 5
                        . Typically, comparing with OmpF, OmpC appears to be less mobile in membrane layer, except P299–315 where small fluctuation can be observed. Also, L3 in all charge states are quite quiet, except L3 in one monomer in NP (Fig. 5B). No significant L3 motion is active. This immobile L3 clearly explains the preserved pore cavity in OmpC. The more rigid protein structure in OmpC also implies the more stable structure. On the contrary, OmpF behaves differently. The first eigenvector in all charge states suggest the more flexible OmpF structure. Most of L3 loops are found to move toward pore cavity during simulations, especially the tip of L3. This observed L3 motion indicates the key role of the tip of L3 in controlling a pore size in a constriction region. Like OmpC, P299–315 in OmpF appears to show larger mobility in both L3 and barrel regions. Admittedly, the observed motions of each monomer in both porins extracted from the first eigenvector seem to occur differently. This can confirm the non-identical behavior of each subunit in both porins. Moreover, the different pronation states of E296 and D312 in OmpF seem to have a high impact on the movement of extracellular loops whereas the loops of OmpC are quieter (Fig. S2 in supplementary information). The extracellular loops become very quiet when either D299 or D315 get protonated in OmpC. However, P299–315 appears to cause the largest loop displacement in both porins. The mobility of extracellular loops in OmpF seems to be more sensitive to protonation states of E296 and D312.

In Table 1
                        , the percentage of key hydrogen bonds occurring in each simulation is determined. These hydrogen bonds are an average across all monomers. Considering the interactions on a latching loop L2, the permanent interactions (∼90%) of R100(92)-D126(118) and R132(124)-E71*(66*) are observed in both porins (see Fig. 6
                         for a location of each residue and the asterisk indicates a residue from an adjacent monomer). These two interactions seem to serve as the crucial interactions to tether L2 to its neighbor unit and consequently sustain trimeric stability. Apart from interacting with R132(124), the backbone of E71*(66*) from adjacent unit is also able to interact with D126(118) in most cases although ∼50% of interactions are lost in P315 and P299–315 of OmpC. Interestingly, the variation of charge states of E296(D299) and D312(315) has no effect on both R132(124)-E71*(66*) and R100(92)-D126(118) interactions. Both persistent interactions at the base of L3 seem to highlight their role in trimeric attachment rather than contribution to loop L3 flexibility.

Considering L3-wall interactions, when at least one of E296(D299) and D312(315) gets protonated (P299, P315, and P299–315), the consistent hydrogen bonds (ranging from ∼84% to ∼99%) between these two residues are observed. Different protonation states seem to give diverse interaction networks. When D312(315) is charged (NP and P299), D312(315) strongly hydrogen bonds with the backbones of E117(109) and F118(110) (above 90% interactions), except E109-D315 in NP of OmpC is nearly vanished. The interactions with the backbones of E117(109) and F118(110) seem to serve as a key player for L3-wall attachment and then gating activity. This can reflect insignificant role of sidechains of E117(109) and F118(110) on anchoring L3 to E296(D299) and D312(315) on the wall. This finding should explain why E109Q mutation in previous OmpC study (Liu and Delcour, 1998) shows no effect on gating activity. P299 is the only one that can provide the tight binding of D312(315) to both E117(109) (>95% hydrogen bonds) and F118(110) (>95% hydrogen bonds) in both proteins. When only D312 is uncharged (P315), OmpF employs E296 to mainly interact with E117 (81.17%) and F118 (98.32%). These persistent interactions with E296 cause the tip of L3 moves towards the barrel wall resulting in the widest pore in P315. In case of P315 in OmpC, D315 remains interacting with E109 (91.74%) where F110 interacts with D299 instead (28.74%). As a rule, D315 in OmpC is able to prolong at least one interaction with E109 or F110. This interaction can prevent the shift of the L3’s end. OmpC therefore shows a small variation in pore size. In case of P299-D315 in both porins, the free carboxylate groups of both E296(D299) and D312(315) are still able to form hydrogen bonds with their nearest residues at the end of L3 although most interactions are weakened. For example, ∼50% of D312(315)-E117(109) and >50% of D312(315)-F118(110) in both proteins are lost during simulations (Table 1). Besides, the transient interaction (∼25%) of E296(D299)-E117(109) is occurred. Overall, P299 in both protein appears to fully support the permanent interactions of D312(315) to E117(109) and F118(110), whereas NP causes the end of L3 to move towards the pore area and therefore affect the pore size, especially in OmpF.

The final orientations of L3 and key residues are presented in Fig. 6. The Figure clearly shows some twisted orientations of the tip of L3 in both porins. This confirms the movement of the tip of L3 obtained from the hydrogen bond analysis. Considering the orientations of residues in a constriction site, Fig. 6 also reveals the interesting orientation of aromatic ring of F110 in OmpC. The phenyl ring of F110 points towards the barrel wall in the similar direction throughout all simulations, whilst the random ring orientation of homologous F118 is captured in OmpF. Basically, the phenyl rings of F110 in OmpC and F118 in OmpF are surrounded by aromatic and non-polar residues. Only in OmpC, K317 is found to reside nearby F110. The constant and short distances within 0.6nm (the efficient distance for cation-pi interaction is 0.6nm based on previous study (Gallivan and Dougherty, 1999) between K317 and F110 may indicate the possibility of cation-pi interaction which can help to strengthen L3-wall attachment for OmpC (Fig. S3 in Supplementary information). This interaction may be one of the key interactions that differentiate OmpC from OmpF and promote the less sensitivity of OmpC. However, the forcefields used in this study are unable to clearly identify the presence of a cation-pi interaction. More advanced quantum techniques are required.

Like earlier studies (Kumar et al., 2010; Dhakshnamoorthy et al., 2010; Heller and Wilson, 1981), this study can also confirm that OmpC is more structurally stable than OmpF. Its pore size is also slightly smaller than that of OmpF. However, this study focuses on the effect of ionization states of E296(D299) and D312(315) at the barrel wall on L3-wall attachment in both OmpC and OmpF. It is interesting that the different protonation states of only two ionisable residues (E296(D299) and D312(315)) can give a clear visible effect on structure and dynamics. It is evident that OmpF is more dependent on the protonation states of these two residues. The pore size is controlled by interactions between the L3’s tip and the wall in both porins. Interactions with D312(D315) on the wall are found to be important for controlling pore cavity. One of the major differences between OmpC and OmpF is the interaction of D312(315). To fasten L3 to the wall, OmpC employs D315 mostly in all cases, while OmpF uses both E296 and D312 depending on the ionization states. E296 is in used when D312 is uncharged. Owing to the different locations of both E296 and D312, this therefore generates the variation in pore size in OmpF. On the contrary, L3 in OmpC is pinned up on the barrel wall by D315 in all cases therefore frozen pore size is obtained. Seemingly, the ability to maintain interactions with D315 in OmpC may explain the lower frequency of pore gating and probably the less pH dependence. The results also show that either E296(D299) or D312(315) being charged is crucial for maintaining L3-wall coupling. P299 seems to provide the most rigid L3 and fixed pore size in both proteins.

However, mutagenesis study is required for further work to bring new knowledge into how these charge states impact electrostatic feature and then solute conductance in both porins. Moreover, the questions on structural and functional differences between OmpC and OmpF remain challenging.
