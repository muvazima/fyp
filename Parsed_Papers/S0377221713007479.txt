                  This paper examines the relationship between seasonality, idiosyncratic risk and mutual fund returns using multifactor models. We use a large sample containing the return histories of 728 UK mutual funds over a 23-year period to measure fund performance. We present evidence that idiosyncratic risk cannot be eliminated, we also find evidence of seasonality in all fund categories. Specifically, we find a close relation between the seasonality and the end of the tax-year. We document that the idiosyncratic risk puzzle cannot explain seasonality in fund performance in the UK. Although, we do find that idiosyncratic risk can account for the seasonality in the month of April. Thus, the results show a link between the tax-loss selling hypothesis in April and idiosyncratic risk in that month. Finally, we report evidence that idiosyncratic risk is negatively related to expected returns for most fund classes.
               
            

The aim of this paper is to contribute to our understanding of fund return seasonality, the idiosyncratic risk puzzle in mutual funds, and the relationship between returns and idiosyncratic risk in fund performance. The motivation is that there are calendar anomalies that affect stock returns and it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that they might affect returns on mutual funds in a similar way. In this paper we empirically test whether there is monthly seasonality as well as idiosyncratic risk in fund performance, and their relationship.

Despite idiosyncratic risk in stock returns has been widely tested, there have been few papers that use idiosyncratic risk to explain the cross-sectional differences in expected returns among fund categories. The empirical literature has not examined general idiosyncratic risk across funds. Investors usually consider that a mutual fund is a well-diversified portfolio in which all idiosyncratic risk is eliminated.

After the finding of seasonality in stock returns in the mid-seventies there have been several papers that explain calendar and size effects. In one of the early papers, Gultekin and Gultekin (1983) found a January effect in sixteen countries, even if the tax-year-end was not December. Since returns are affected by systematic and idiosyncratic risk, idiosyncratic risk may provide meaningful information on the observed seasonality of returns.

Most studies examining seasonality or idiosyncratic risk are based on USA data. Studies of the UK market are more limited and have mainly focused on the analysis of stock returns. This paper aims to add to the existing literature about mutual funds, looking at the relationship between idiosyncratic risk and seasonality with regard to performance of UK mutual funds, using a larger data set than previous studies on UK mutual funds. Furthermore, the issue of fund classification is taken into consideration.

The motivation behind fund classification is that the fund category is also an important component of stock returns. Investors who cannot diversify their stocks are influenced by industry-specific and idiosyncratic volatilities, as well as market volatility. The price of a fund depends on the total volatility of the fund return, including industry-specific and idiosyncratic volatility, in addition to market volatility.

The study reports the following results. First, idiosyncratic risk cannot be eliminated for most funds categories. Second, idiosyncratic risk can explain the seasonality in the month of April for all fund categories for which this month presents seasonal effects. Thus, the results show a link between the tax-loss selling hypothesis and idiosyncratic risk in April. Third, idiosyncratic risk is negatively significant in predicting market returns in most fund categories. We also document no evidence that funds with high idiosyncratic risk have higher returns. Finally, we find that idiosyncratic risk can forecast fund returns after controlling for macroeconomic variables.

The risk-return relation is an important topic in asset pricing. Merton (1973) showed a positive relation between risk and return in the stock market. However, after a long empirical literature, there is no a clear consensus about the tradeoff for stock market indices.

The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) assumes that all investors hold the market portfolio. Then, only systematic risk is considered. For several reasons, investors may not hold perfectly diversified portfolios. There are various asset pricing models in the literature that consider idiosyncratic risk. Some theories predict that idiosyncratic risk is positively related to expected stock returns. Levy (1978) and Malkiel and Xu (2006) state that the idiosyncratic risk is important as many investors do not hold diversified portfolios. Similar to Merton (1987), they create a CAPM model where investors hold undiversified portfolios. The new model relates the beta of the stock to the market and with a measure of idiosyncratic risk. Mayers (1976) incorporates a human capital factor in a CAPM and reaches a similar pricing model.


                        Campbell, Martin, Malkiel, and Xu (2001) study long-term trends in firm and market volatility in United States stock markets from 1962 to 1997. They find a significant positive trend in idiosyncratic firm-level volatility, while market volatility has no significant trend using monthly data from 1926 to 1997. The authors argue that the correlations among individual stock returns have declined in the last decades, as the trend in idiosyncratic volatility has increased relative to market volatility. They suggest several causes, like the preference for firms to access the stock market earlier, executive compensation schemes that reward stock volatility, and large conglomerates broken into smaller corporations. In contrast, Bekaert, Hodrick, and Zhang (2012) show that there is no upward trend in idiosyncratic volatility anywhere in the developed world. They find that idiosyncratic volatility is well described by a stationary regime-switching, mean reverting process with occasional shifts to a higher-mean, higher-variance regime. They point that idiosyncratic variability is highly correlated across countries, and this correlation has increased over time. Brandt, Brav, Graham, and Kumar (2013) present new evidence about the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle, they show that by 2003 volatility falls back to pre-1990s levels. They also find that the increase and subsequent reversal is concentrated among firms with low share prices. They suggest that the increase in idiosyncratic volatility through the 1990s was an episodic phenomenon rather than a time trend, and was partially associated with the trading of retail investors.


                        Goyal and Santa-Clara (2003, hereafter GS) find a new approach to test the relevance of a time-series relationship between risk and return in the aggregate stock market. Their relevant contribution is to consider average stock risk for predictability. They compute average stock risk for each month as the cross-sectional average of the variances of all the stocks traded in that month. Consistent with some previous studies, they show that the lagged variance of the market has no predictive power for the market return. However, GS find a relevant positive relation between the equal-weighted average stock volatility and the value-weighted portfolio returns.

Many authors do not agree with CAPM or Merton (1973), among them Campbell (1987), Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (1993), and Whitelaw (1994) discover that there is no relation between risk and return or exist a negative tradeoff in the time-series data. Early empirical research that rejected the model include Lintner (1965), Douglas (1969), Miller and Scholes (1972). Douglas (1969) argues that residual variance is also priced according to average returns in a single cross-sectional regression. Fama and MacBeth (1973) create a new cross-sectional test and reject the role of idiosyncratic risk in the CAPM. Miller and Scholes (1972) find that different bias may exist, like errors in measuring beta, correlation between betas and residual variances, and omitting the risk free rate. King, Sentana, and Wadhwani (1994) study the volatility relation among national stock markets, they find that idiosyncratic economic shocks are priced and that the price of risk differs across stock markets. Falkenstein (1996) provides evidence that idiosyncratic volatility influenced the equity holdings of mutual fund managers.


                        Wei and Zhang (2005) have re-examined the result of GS in an extended sample period from 1963 to 2002, an additional three years, and in contrast with GS, they did not find significant positive relationship between average returns and pre-determined average return volatility measures. Another study by Bali, Cakici, Yan, and Zhang (2005) find that GS results are not robust for different stock portfolios and sample periods. They find that GS result is due to small stocks traded on the Nasdaq, and is partly driven by liquidity premium.


                        Guo and Savickas (2006) argue that idiosyncratic risk, jointly with stock market risk and liquidity risk, is a significant determinant of the equity premium. Furthermore, they show that idiosyncratic volatility is negatively related to future stock returns. Similarly, Easley, Hvidkjaer, and O’Hara (2002) and Ang, Hodrick, Xing and Zhang (2006), Ang, Hodrick, Xing and Zhang (2009) find that stocks with high past idiosyncratic volatility have lower future returns compared to stock with relatively low past idiosyncratic volatility. Chen, Huang, and Jha (2012) show that the variation in idiosyncratic return volatility from 1978 to 2009 is attributable to managerial discretion in accruals after controlling for operating uncertainty. They state that the findings hold during various subperiods, including the recent financial crisis, and after controlling for a number of alternative explanations.


                        Ang et al. (2006) provide empirical evidence suggesting that US stocks returns are negatively related to lagged idiosyncratic volatility. They find a large difference in average returns between stocks with low and high idiosyncratic volatility. Another paper of Ang et al. (2009) show that the negative relation between lagged idiosyncratic volatility and future average returns exists in a sample of international markets. Strong negative relation between lagged idiosyncratic volatility and average excess returns is observed in each of the largest seven equity markets (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK) and also in a larger sample of 23 developed markets. They point out that the idiosyncratic volatility effect strongly co-moves with the low returns earned by stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility around the world. Hueng and Yau (2013) find that lagged idiosyncratic volatility is a better proxy for expected idiosyncratic risk in the country-level data than in the firm-level data. They point that, in the case of global equity indices, past idiosyncratic volatility is a good predictor of expected idiosyncratic volatility.


                        Eiling (2013) relates human capital to the premium for idiosyncratic risk that is shown in several empirical papers. She shows that when (industry-specific) human capital is excluded from the benchmark used to measure systematic risk, the resulting residual risk affects the cross-section of expected returns. Furthermore, the importance of the idiosyncratic risk premium depends on the exposure to human capital returns. Panousi and Papanikolaou (2012) show that the negative effect of idiosyncratic risk on investment is stronger when executives own a larger part of the company’s shares, they point that this negative effect arises from poor managerial diversification. Although, the effect of insider ownership on the investment–uncertainty relation disappears if institutional investors form a large part of the shareholder base, possibly due to more effective monitoring of managerial decisions.

Seasonality in equity returns results from a seasonality effect in the action of investors. A growing number of authors suggest that share turnover may have a relevant role in determining assets price movement. Many studies, including Karpoff (1987), state that turnover and return are positively correlated using daily or monthly data and that past turnover have predicting power for future returns (see Baker and Stein (2004) or Piqueira (2005)).

The three most common explanations found in the literature for seasonality are holiday effect, window dressing, and tax-loss selling. The holiday effect improves a stock performance in the month prior to the holiday period, and leads to a lower than normal performance in the month after the holiday period. Window dressing consists in adjusting a portfolio in a specific time period, usually in the last few days before the end of a fiscal year. Tax-loss selling leads a stock’s performance to be lower than normal in the month in which investors sell their stocks for tax-loss purposes.

There is a growing research that evaluates the relation between variation in the trading patterns of investors and seasonality in equity returns. Some relevant contributions include Gibson, Safieddine, and Titman (2000) who find seasonality in fund trading activity prior to the tax year end, which is consistent with selling underperforming stocks more quickly than other stocks. Carhart, Kaniel, Musto, and Reed (2002) find evidence of the inflation of stock prices held by US mutual funds at the end of each quarter, as a consequence of managers following aggressive trading strategies. Ng and Wang (2004) find that US institutional traders are more active in sales of small loser stocks in the last quarter of the year, then institutions buy both winner and loser small stocks in the following quarter. They argue that the January effect is due to the institutional trading behavior amongst small stocks. In a similar way, using Finnish data, Grinblatt and Keloharju (2004) show that investors incur tax-loss selling before tax-year end.

In a recent paper, Hong and Yu (2008) investigate seasonality in stock trading activity associated with summer vacation. Using turnover and stock data from 51 stock markets, they discover that turnover is lower for the summer period compared to the rest of the year by an average of 7.9%. They define summer as three months period, being July August and September for Northern Hemisphere and January, February and March for Southern Hemisphere. They also find that stock returns are lower in the summer, the mean monthly value-weighted market return being lower during the summer by 0.90%. Both effects, the turnover and the stock return, are larger for the ten biggest stock markets, and more significant for North America and Europe. This is related to other papers on the summer effect, one of them is Bouman and Jacobsen (2002), which documents that stock returns are lower from May to October than during the rest of the year for a cross-section of 37 countries. They find this ‘Sell in May’ effect to be more important in European countries and constant over time. They provide sample evidence of a ‘Sell in May’ effect noticeable in the UK stock market since 1694, in several other countries has been noticeable for a very long time. Another paper that considers summer seasonality is Kamstra, Kramer, and Levi (2003), they argue that seasonal affective disorder (SAD) affects stock market returns during the summer. They explain that research in psychology has found a relationship between depression and lowered risk-taking, then seasonal variation in the length of days can influence equity returns. They consider stock markets data from countries around the world, and affirm that there is an important effect of seasonal affective disorder on stock returns in all markets. Garrett, Kamstra, and Kramer (2005) question whether the Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) can be explained by a conditional asset pricing model with a risk premium varying over time. They study daily and monthly stock market returns for a number of countries, including US, Sweden, New Zealand, UK, Japan and Australia. Following Bekaert and Harvey (1995), they find that a conditional version of the CAPM, which takes into account the SAD, allows for time-variation in market risk and a time-varying price of risk.


                        Kelly and Meschke (2010) re-examine the SAD effect by replicating and extending Kamstra et al. (2003) paper. They show that the SAD hypothesis is unsupported by the psychological literature, that there is no relation between the stock returns and the prevalence of SAD in the general population, and that the econometric specification of the SAD model creates the statistical significance cited as evidence for the SAD effect. They state that an association between sentiment-affecting events and stock prices is not enough to establish a causal link between the two. They explain that papers that investigate whether investor sentiment influences stock returns focus on identifying events that affect mood and are unlikely to affect economic opportunities. They state that these papers do not take into account three relevant aspects by not investigating whether the event induced mood change affects investor perception of financial risk or return, whether this change is reflected in trading behavior, and whether these sentiment-based trades affect stock prices.

One of the common forms of seasonality in stock returns in the literature is the “January effect”. An early study by Dyl (1977) showed that capital gains taxation on stocks influence investors’ year-end decisions, as capital gains taxes give investors an incentive to realize capital losses, and this has an effect on the trading volume in December. He finds abnormal trading volume in December, with low volume for stocks that have appreciated during the year, and high volume for stock prices that have decreased in the year, showing tax loss sales at the end of the year. Ritter (1988) is another relevant paper that studies the “January effect”, he argues that investors sell stocks in December, which have experienced a decline in price during the year in order to realize losses for tax purposes. Then, investors wait until January to invest their profits in a wide range of small stocks, creating the “parking the proceeds” hypothesis. He suggests that the January effect may be increased by cash injections from year-end bonuses and from sales of larger companies. Haug and Hirschey (2005) also provide evidence of the January effect using large capitalization and small stocks for the period 1802–2004. They find a persistent January effect for small capitalization stocks even after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. They confirm that Fama and French (1993) size and book factors foster the January effect for small cap stocks. They also show a persistently negative January effect for momentum stocks. The authors conclude stating that the January effect is mainly driven by small stocks, and has not been influenced by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.


                        Yao (2012) investigates the causes of the success of long-term contrarian and intermediate-term momentum using several tests. They find that long-term contrarian is due entirely to the January size effect. He shows that the January contrarian strategy is extraordinarily profitable, while the contrarian strategy outside of January is economically and statistically unprofitable. His findings are robust to different subperiods. He points that his findings answer the question raised by Novy-Marx (2011) about the heavy dependence of momentum on intermediate-term prior returns. In a series of tests, he shows that the superior performance of intermediate-term prior returns in momentum is due to the January seasonality profits neutralizing the well-known January momentum losses.


                        Zhang and Jacobsen (2012) state that seasonal monthly anomalies strongly depend on the sample period considered. They show that few calendar months have significantly outperform, or underperform persistently over 300years. They interpret that their result confirms the potential problems caused by data snooping, noise and selection bias, and highlights the importance of studying long time series. They point that many if not all calendar month anomalies may be spurious. Their overall conclusion is that monthly seasonals might simply be in the eye of the beholder.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present a theoretical analysis, including a link between fund return seasonality and idiosyncratic risk. In Section 3, we introduce the data set and present some preliminary analysis. In Section 4, we describe the methodology used in the research. In Section 5, we examine and discuss the empirical results. Concluding comments are contained in Section 6.

Evidence from psychology and financial decision making states that investors change their risk-taking behavior when decisions are taken in a multi-period scenario. Thaler (1985) explains that financial decisions concerning multiple periods are examined in intertemporal mental accounts, and the results from last period influence the risk-taking tendency in the subsequent period. Barberis and Huang (2001) explain that mental accounting by investors is relevant for understanding stock return anomalies such as the value effect. Thaler and Johnson (1990) show that after gaining in the lottery, individuals become more risk seeking in the following lottery games, this is known as the “house money effect”. They also show that after a loss and being offered the option to break even, individuals are also more willing to continue gambling, this is known as the “break-even effect”. Several authors, including Ackert, Charupat, Church, and Deaves (2006), O’Connell and Teo (2007), and Liu, Tasi, Wang and Zhu (2010), find evidence supporting these effects in several markets. Thus, if the turn of the New Year is the starting point for a new round of investing, we would expect that changes in risk-taking behavior happen more often at the start of the New Year.

We can conclude that theoretical models suggest that investor risk-taking preference can impact equilibrium asset prices. The finance literature has paid increasing attention to return anomalies in recent years, as we have mentioned in the introduction there are several patterns unexplained by systematic factor models. Research evidence in individual risk taking shows that investors exhibit stronger risk-taking preferences at the turn-of-the-new-year. Thus, we expect stocks to outperform at this time of the year as a consequence of an excess demand from investors. We investigate this hypothesis using UK mutual funds.

A recent body of empirical literature has arisen about the hypothesized link between seasonality and idiosyncratic risk. Doran, Jiang and Peterson (2012a,b, hereafter DJP) show that the volatility-return relation can be better understood by taking into account January from non-January months. The authors provide evidence that the underperformance of stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility is mainly in the non-January months, what they call the “non-January idiosyncratic volatility puzzle”. In January highly volatile stocks normally outperform low volatile stocks. However, there is a significant underperformance of high idiosyncratic volatility stocks when January returns are not included. This study is the first to research the relation between idiosyncratic volatility and stock returns for January and non-January months. DJP state that since highly volatile stocks tend to be small companies and past losers, they are likely to be exposed to the January effect. This fosters a positive relation between returns and idiosyncratic volatility for January. Finally, they provide evidence showing that some highly volatile stocks have better than expected earnings and return performance near earnings announcements. Thus, they state that their evidence is consistent with behavioral models, proving that high idiosyncratic volatility is associated with systematic over- and under-pricing.

In a recent study, the same authors (Doran, Jiang and Peterson (2012a,b, hereafter DJP 2012)) provide an explanation for the positive volatility-return relation of January, they argument that the January volatility effect is due to stocks with lottery returns. Usually these stocks trade at low prices and have negative and skewed returns during the rest of the year. DJP 2012 argument that two characteristics make low-price and high-volatility stocks so attractive for individual investors at the beginning of the New Year. First, investors have a preference for stocks with lottery features, as recent research shows that investors tend to prefer positively-skewed returns (see Barberis and Huang (2008)). The second characteristic of their conjecture is the “mental accounting” of financial investments. It is normal that individuals take New Year’s decisions about investments, as they do about family or health, and start with these plans in January. Hence, at the beginning of a new year investors will have a stronger preference for lottery-type stocks and will impact stock prices more than at other periods of the year. DJP 2012 make the assumption that the large allocation of individual investor funds in lottery-type securities at the beginning of the New Year can create abnormally high January returns in stock with high idiosyncratic volatility and low prices.

The data consists of a sample of multi-sector mutual funds for the UK over the period January 1987 to December 2010. The fund names, ISIN codes, and fund classifications are obtained from Bloomberg, and the returns are from Datastream. We study local currency returns for all the mutual funds in the UK (728), including non-surviving funds. We divide the funds in sub-samples of multi-sector funds classified as per Bloomberg as: (a) Value (37); (b) Small capitalization (110); (c) Large capitalization (93); (d) Growth (223); (e) Emerging markets (34); (f) Multi capitalization (118); and (g) Global equity (143). These sub-samples account for around half of the whole sample of funds, the other funds might fall under other Bloomberg classification, which we are not going to consider for this study. We focus on the fund categories used by institutional investors.

The fund data comprises monthly prices and returns for all the active and non-surviving mutual funds in our fund categories over the sample period. The monthly returns measure the performance of the fund, assuming that dividends are re-invested to purchase additional units of the funds at the closing price applicable on the ex-dividend date. The one-month UK Treasury bill rate is used as a proxy for the risk-free rate. The return on FTSE All Shares Index is used as a market return proxy. The FTSE All-Share Index is a capitalization-weighted index, which is an aggregation of the FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and FTSE Small Cap Indicescomprising around 800 of more than 2000 companies that are traded on the London Stock Exchange, which represents 98–99% of the UK market capitalization.

The focus is on monthly returns for three reasons. First, monthly returns do not reflect short-term asymmetric information and changes in liquidity around earnings announcement dates. Second, monthly returns are a common unit for financial economists and permits easy comparison to existing patterns. Third, considering a short window around the earnings announcement date misses much of the premium, this is relevant as missing the premium does not provide sufficient window to measure seasonality. A month window is more informative than a shorter window, as prior to the announcement day, there is an important pre-event run-up, and a positive drift after the announcement.

We specify a local version of the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model to estimate idiosyncratic risk. We use the FTSE All-Shares Index to calculate the market factor, the FTSE Small Cap Index monthly return minus the FTSE 100 Index monthly return yield the country-specific factor SMB, and the monthly return of the MSCI UK Value Index minus the monthly return of the MSCI UK Growth Index will yield the value factor HML (see Banegas, Gillen, Timmermann, and Wermers (2013)). We will use these monthly data for the three factors for the whole period of the study. The data for these indices is obtained from Datastream.


                     Table 1
                      presents summary statistics for the fund returns for each sub-sample, it provides mean returns and standard deviations of returns for each of the fund categories. The standard deviation of a funds’ return series gives an indication of the risk for each group of funds over the period, it measures the investment’s volatility. There is a positive relationship between fund return and risk. Although the risk-return trade off is not proportional across all sub-samples of funds, some fund categories have lower returns while present a higher risk than others. For example, large capitalization funds earn a return of 0.422 with a standard deviation of 1, while multi-capitalization funds present an average return of 0.384 and a standard deviation of 1.053.

There is a moderate variation in the average returns across the sub-sample of funds. The average return ranges from 0.384 for multi-capitalization funds to 0.671 of the emerging market funds. Although, the whole sample of funds presents a return of only 0.482, while the FTSE All Share Index shows a return of 0.342. Thus, an investor will earn a higher return if he replicates our sub-samples of funds that if he invests in a fund that replicates the whole sample or the FTSE All Share Index. This could be due to the fact that, usually, funds in each sub-sample have a more active fund manager than the rest of the funds in the entire sample. Thus, these fund managers succeed in beating the market as well as other funds which follow a more passive strategy.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

In this paper we investigate the relationship between seasonality and idiosyncratic risk in the cross-section of expected fund returns in the UK. We use panel data analysis for estimation of empirical results. We use fixed effects to estimate a separate intercept for each fund and to create a consistent estimator. The number of funds is not constant over the consecutive years of the study. This is generated by two major reasons. The first reason is that some funds, which have consistent negative performance, cease to exist or merge with other funds. Besides, new funds started during the studying period. Thus, we obtained an unbalanced panel.

We choose to consider the newly initiated funds and the ceased ones in the sample in order to deal with the issue of survivorship bias. When the estimation of average returns does not consider the performance of the liquidated funds causes return overvaluation. We try to mitigate this problem by taking into account the returns of the ceased funds.

Inspired by the literature on seasonality in asset pricing models, we test the differences in month-to-month mean returns based on the approach of Gultekin and Gultekin (1983):

                         is the usual error term and it is expected to have zero mean. The coefficient of interest is the one in front of the seasonal dummy, which tells us how returns differ in that month as compared to the rest of the year. The dummy variable takes the value of 1 when month t falls on a specific month. I.e. the February dummy receives the value of 1 if the return of a fund refers to February and zero otherwise. The intercept of model reflects the average return on January and comprises the comparative basis for the other monthly dummies. The coefficients, ai
                        (i
                        =1,2,3,…,12) represent the difference between the return of January and month t. The null hypothesis to be tested is that all dummy variables coefficients are equal to zero. Indication of a negative value of a dummy coefficient would be proof of a January effect. The estimation of the coefficients in Eq. (1) will specify which months have lower or higher average returns than the ones obtained in January. The January returns are chosen as the comparative benchmark since the literature documents the existence of a strong positive January effect in stock returns. In the analysis of fund returns, seasonal effects might play a very important role, and the seasonal variations can be easily examined with the use of dummy variables.

The FTSE All Share Index is the benchmark for normal performance that controls for equity market seasonality. If the returns of funds varies across calendar months due to seasonality in equity returns, then so will the benchmark.

                         represent the returns on portfolios formed to capture the size effect and the book-to-market equity effect. The country specific Rsmb
                         is the return of the FTSE Small Cap Index less the return of the FTSE 100 index. The value of Rhml
                         is the return of the F MSCI UK Value Index less the return of the MSCI UK Growth Index.

The idiosyncratic risk for each month is measured as the standard deviation of the residuals εi

                         after estimating Eq. (2) using monthly excess returns over the entire period of study.

The current literature tends to measure idiosyncratic risk using this model. Although it is difficult to interpret the residuals from the CAPM or a multi-factor model as only showing idiosyncratic risk. As these residuals could only represent omitted factors, it can only be stated that the residuals from a market model measure idiosyncratic risk in the context of that model.


                        Elton, Gruber, Das, and Hlavka (1993) show that multifactor models do a better job capturing the return-generating process of mutual funds. The three-factor model of Fama and French (1993), Fama and French (1996) includes terms that capture the differential dynamics of small cap stocks relative to large cap stocks (SMB) and high book-to-market stocks relative to low book-to-market stocks (HML) in addition to the market factor. Malkiel and Xu (2006) argument that both, companies’ systematic volatilities (β) and idiosyncratic volatilities influence the individual stocks’ expected returns.

We estimate idiosyncratic risk for each sub-sample of funds considering that large portfolios make estimates of the residual variance more accurate. Due to diversification effects, when there are too many stocks in each portfolio, idiosyncratic risk does not have much variability across portfolios. Thus, forming sub-samples of funds by categories helps to differentiate the variability of idiosyncratic risk due to specific stock characteristics.

We use panel data analysis as it is useful in predicting long-term or cumulative effects which are normally hard to analyze in a cross-sectional study, and it allows the study of the dynamic behavior of the parameters.

We explore the linkage between idiosyncratic risk and funds returns for all months, including the ones that present seasonality. We regress returns on each category of funds on the lagged idiosyncratic risk measure a set of risk factors. The basic relationship between average returns and average idiosyncratic risk is reflected in the sign of the slope coefficient of the idiosyncratic risk factor in the following time-series regression:

                           Table 2
                            reports summarized seasonality results based on the estimation of regression (1). Statistically significant seasonal effects in January exist for all funds categories. Continuing the analysis, we estimate alternative versions of regression (1) where instead of excluding the dummy variable for the January returns, we now exclude the dummies for the months that returns appear not to be statistically significant.

We have found significant effects occurring in February and May for all fund categories, except for Emerging Market funds in May, while for six out of seven cases we have found significant effects for April (Value, Multi Cap, Large Cap, Growth, Global Equity and Emerging Market Funds). A Special case is the Emerging Market Funds, for which there is also evidence of seasonality in December.

There is a stronger evidence of the January effect in Value, Small and Emerging Market Funds. As expected, the January effect in small-capitalization and value stock returns is remarkably consistent over time. When individuals reinvest their funds, they tend to do it in small and value stocks (see Reinganum (1983)). This is why small stocks as a group outperform large stocks in January.

Rules for the tax-year-end in the UK are not straight forward. For most individuals the tax-year ends on 5th April, except for the self-employed. For companies and institutional investors the end-of-tax year is their own accounting year-end and may be any month of the year. Most companies have either March-end or December-end as their accounting year-end. Tax-year-ends occur mainly at the end of December for institutional investors. Thus, the distribution of share-ownership is very important in assessing the role of tax on the seasonality of stock returns in the UK. Consequently, for the London market the tax-loss selling hypothesis would predict a higher January and April effect.

The January effect is mainly due to institutional window dressing. The window-dressing was suggested as a cause of the January effect by Haugen and Lakonishok (1988). Lakonishok, Shleifer, Thaler, and Vishny (1991) show that US portfolio managers sell stocks that have performed poorly in the past compared to their holdings at the end of their reporting periods. Window dressing involves an institutional investor changing portfolio composition for reporting purposes. Portfolio managers have framed their portfolio’s assets into “winners” and “losers” and it is hypothesized that they sell their “losers” at the end of the calendar year and purchase “winners” with the funds generated from selling the “losers”, hoping to increase the attractiveness of their portfolios by having more “winners” in the portfolio than previously. The February seasonality could be explained as the January effect spilled over into February (see Cooper, McConnell, and Ovtchinnikov (2006)). Although monthly returns in February are not greater than January returns.

Regarding the April seasonal effect there exists two main informational effects. First, the UK government announces the annual budget including all the government’s income plans and information on fiscal and monetary policy and targets in the month of March. Second, April is the end of the tax year in the UK. Thus, it is possible that this period can be perceived as a riskier period in the British economy, as information released in the budget will cause investors to reassess the performance of the economy in the near future. It is likely that companies’ investment and production plans will be affected by changes in the March budget, through changes in macroeconomic or fiscal policy. Any unexpected changes will cause investors to reassess the future cash flows of companies, thus investors require a larger expected return to hold this risk.

In this study, the tax-loss selling hypothesis is a correct representation of seasonality in stock returns, as it is possible to appreciate both conditions for this hypothesis. A drop in return at the end of the tax-year, December and March, and a significant increase at the beginning of the new tax-year, January and April. The tax-loss selling effect causes investors to sell their losing positions at the end of the tax year. The January/April Effect is predicated on the idea that these stocks, which have been sold off to realize the tax losses, will be at a discount to their market value. Any deviation from these trends would reduce the explanatory ability of the tax-loss selling hypothesis.

Seasonality in the month of May can be explained as the tax-loss selling effect extended into May. The “sell in May” effect is not a possible explanation, as our results for the month of May present higher abnormal returns than other months, and the “sell in May” hypothesis suggests that average returns are higher during the period November–April than during the period May to October.

Regarding seasonality on emerging markets funds, we find further seasonality in the month of December. It is difficult to find an explanation for this effect, as there are funds included from different countries. There has not been so much empirical evidence regarding seasonality on emerging equity markets compared to existing results from both developed and developing markets.

The seasonality found in emerging market funds is probably due to the information hypothesis (Keim (1983)) in many emerging stock markets. Thus, relatively inefficient stock markets can provide ample opportunity for investors to time their stock investments to earn abnormal returns.

We find that idiosyncratic risk cannot be eliminated in UK mutual funds. Campbell et al. (2001) find that idiosyncratic variation in US stock returns have increased over the long-term. As a mutual fund is a portfolio of stocks, when idiosyncratic risk increases in stock returns, idiosyncratic risk of mutual funds should also increase except when it can be eliminated by a well-diversified portfolio, which is not the case in this study. We find that monthly idiosyncratic risk reach the highest level for the years 1999 and 2000. Mutual funds may often hold portfolios of stocks from similar industries, thus the idiosyncratic risk cannot be eliminated.

Across fund categories, there is no evidence that funds with high idiosyncratic risk have higher returns. In fact, we find mixed evidence, which means that months with high idiosyncratic risk present both positive and negative returns. Goyal and Santa-Clara (2003) find a significantly positive relationship between average stock returns and average return volatility measures. The result is interpreted as evidence that idiosyncratic risk matters in asset pricing. Examining the issue for different fund categories, we find that the positive relationship is not confirmed. While high returns across funds categories are concentrated mainly from January to May, and in December, high idiosyncratic risk months are founds across the year, except July and August. For instance, there is high idiosyncratic risk during the months of October and November for most fund categories, while the majority of them present negative average returns for these months. Overall, we find a positive relationship between returns and idiosyncratic risk for February. In contrast, there is no strong evidence of high idiosyncratic risk for January, while returns are usually the highest for the calendar year. Thus, the trading strategy suggested by Goyal and Santa-Clara would not yield sustained economic gains if it were implemented in the UK fund industry. Considering the average monthly fund performance, we find a positive relationship in Small Cap funds, these show higher idiosyncratic risk and higher returns, but this evidence is not sustained by all fund categories. Thus, it cannot be confirmed that high idiosyncratic risk funds on average outperform low volatility funds. Table 3
                            shows idiosyncratic risk across fund categories. The table presents the results of the average idiosyncratic risk measure per month as obtained from regression (2).

Given the mixed evidence found from the results, the conclusion reached by Ang et al. (2009) cannot be confirmed either. They show that stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility around the world have lower returns than stocks with low idiosyncratic volatility. Their paper is interesting for comparison, as they use regional versions of the Fama and French factor model.

In previous studies small and growth companies are usually expected to show higher idiosyncratic risk. This is confirmed in our case, as these fund categories present the highest idiosyncratic risk. Malkiel and Xu (1997) argument that portfolio size and idiosyncratic volatility are highly correlated, then it is possible to conclude that the idiosyncratic risk captures the size effect. Therefore, the size variable may be a proxy for the idiosyncratic risk variable.

Our results indicate that the idiosyncratic risk puzzle cannot explain seasonality in fund performance in the UK. There is not clear evidence of any relationship between seasonality and idiosyncratic risk, mixed evidence is present. From Table 3
                           , it is possible to appreciate that the month of January does not show, in general, an idiosyncratic risk above the average for the year, in contrast most fund categories appear to have an above average idiosyncratic risk in February. Again, we find no significant relation for the tax-year-end in April, although five out of seven fund categories show high idiosyncratic risk in April, and three out of seven in the months of May, only three fund categories show high idiosyncratic risk for both months. In the case of Emerging Markets funds, high idiosyncratic risk is only present in three out of seven months where there is seasonality: January, February and December. Thus, the empirical evidence is controversial, the positive relationship is not substantiated.

Since prior literature documents a number of January anomalies, a natural question is whether the January idiosyncratic risk puzzle can explain the returns seasonality. DJP indicate that there is positive relation between returns and idiosyncratic risk in the USA. The results, shown in Table 3, clearly suggest that there is no January idiosyncratic risk effect that can explain seasonality in returns for funds in UK. We find a significant positive relationship for Small Cap funds for the month of January, but not for the other categories of funds. In this sense, it cannot be confirmed a strong positive relationship for January.

Consistent with previous studies on the dynamic relation between stock returns and idiosyncratic risk, we focus on one-period forecasts by regressing excess fund returns on lagged idiosyncratic risk. Our one-month-ahead predictive regression approach has been widely used in the finance literature. We re-examine the dynamic relation between idiosyncratic risk and market returns by exploring the linkage with fund returns seasonality. Table 4 presents the results of regressions for the monthly mutual fund return, as shown in the table, idiosyncratic risk cannot explain seasonality for most months in the different fund categories. Overall, idiosyncratic risk and the expected returns of funds will be unrelated for most months. However, we do find that it is useful in explaining the seasonality effect in certain months, especially the month of April. The literature presents conflicting results on the sign of this coefficient in the stock market. Goyal and Santa-Clara (2003) show that the average standard deviation is positively significant in predicting market returns, whereas Kearney and Poti (2008), and Guo and Savickas (2006) find a significantly negative relation. For our data and sample period, we find both, positive and negative significant coefficients. This means highly idiosyncratic risk may increase or reduce next month mutual fund returns depending on the fund category.

The beta variable for idiosyncratic risk is statistically significant for five out of six fund categories that present April seasonality. A strong negative relation between idiosyncratic risk and average returns exists in four fund categories, and a positive relation exists for Growth funds. Therefore, the evidence suggests that the tax-loss selling hypothesis in April appears to be important in explaining the idiosyncratic risk in that month, however we find no evidence for the January effect. An exception is the Emerging Markets funds, as idiosyncratic risk does not account for seasonality in April, instead it is statistically significant and negative for January. A possible explanation for this finding could be due to the fact that most emerging markets like China, Russia or Brazil have tax-year-end on December 31st. In our analysis we control for market, size, value, and momentum factors. Controlling for these factors does not remove the explanatory power of idiosyncratic risk. Examining the coefficient on factor loadings, there is a statistically significant size and book-to-market effects for most months in all fund categories. There is also a strong evidence of momentum across all fund categories.

The tax-loss selling hypothesis predicts that stocks that have fallen during the year face downward price pressure near year-end as investors sell them to realize capital losses to minimize tax payments, and in the month immediately following the tax year-end, abnormal returns of small firms will be larger relative to other months and larger firms. This is confirmed in our study, however idiosyncratic risk falls slightly below the significance level for January, thus it cannot account for the seasonality in this month.

In summary, our empirical results show that (1) idiosyncratic risk by itself is important in explaining expected returns in specific months, it has strong predictive power and can account for seasonality in the months that the tax-loss selling hypothesis is more important as well as the main cause of seasonality in stock returns; (2) its explanatory power is not taken away by other variables, such as size, book-to-market, and momentum; and (3) the findings are robust to return data from different fund categories.

Thus, the result clearly shows that the claim that idiosyncratic risk matters in asset pricing can be substantiated.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we investigate the relation between seasonality and idiosyncratic risk in mutual fund performance. Employing monthly data from 728 mutual funds registered in the UK, we group them into fund categories according to their characteristics and examine the roles of idiosyncratic risk and seasonality in each fund portfolio. We first determine whether there exist a seasonal pattern in the UK fund market, and the presence of idiosyncratic risk in our funds, then we test for a hypothetical link between both market anomalies. Finally we discuss the implications of our main findings for portfolio management and asset pricing.

We find evidence of seasonality in all fund categories. The seasonal pattern is usually in the months of January, February, April and May. The findings indicate a close relation between the seasonality and the end of the tax-year. We also find that there is substantial difference in the period January–May and the remainder of the year. Our evidence from the results show that during the period January–June and for the month of December returns are positive, while for the period July–November returns are negative for most fund categories.

Regarding idiosyncratic risk, we do not find any significant relation, positive or negative, between fund returns and idiosyncratic risk. Furthermore, we find no evidence of a significant link between seasonality and idiosyncratic risk, mixed evidence is present. The results show that the idiosyncratic risk puzzle cannot explain seasonality in fund performance in the UK. However, we do find that idiosyncratic risk can account for the seasonality in the month of April for all fund categories for which this month presents seasonal effects. The results present a negative relation between idiosyncratic risk and average returns for April in four fund categories, and a positive relation exists for Growth funds. Thus, the evidence suggests that the tax-loss selling hypothesis is relevant to explain the idiosyncratic risk in April.

Consistent with a higher-moment CAPM, we confirm that idiosyncratic risk is negatively related to expected returns for most fund categories, except for Value and Small capitalization funds, for which is positively related. Thus, idiosyncratic risk cannot be eliminated by a well-diversified portfolio. We also find that idiosyncratic risk is related to market fundamentals, which means that it is influenced by fluctuations on macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, idiosyncratic risk, as already shown by previous studies, predicts future fund returns.

Our empirical results are important for asset pricing as they provide new evidence on the performance of mutual fund returns. At a practical level, the results are important as they provide important information to investors regarding the best time to buy and sell mutual funds investment products. More generally, this study suggests that we need more models that can explain the role of market anomalies and expected returns. Future research could examine patterns in trading volume and explain seasonal patterns in expected returns in terms of disaggregated idiosyncratic risk measures.
