                  This paper develops an analytical representation of conformal mapping for genus-zero implicit surfaces based on algebraic polynomial functions, and its application to surface shape similarity assessment. Generally, the conformal mapping often works as a tool of planar or spherical parameterization for triangle mesh surfaces. It is further exploited for implicit surface matching in this study. The method begins with discretizing one implicit surface by triangle mesh, where a discrete harmonic energy model related to both the mesh and the other implicit surface is established based on a polynomial-function mapping. Then both the zero-center constraint and the landmark constraints are added to the model to ensure the uniqueness of mapping result with the Möbius transformation. By searching optimal polynomial coefficients with the Lagrange–Newton method, the analytical representation of conformal mapping is obtained, which reveals all global and continuous one-to-one correspondent point pairs between two implicit surfaces. Finally, a shape similarity assessment index for (two) implicit surfaces is proposed through calculating the differences of all the shape index values among those corresponding points. The proposed analytical representation method of conformal mapping and the shape assessment index are both verified by the simulation cases for the closed genus-zero implicit surfaces. Experimental results show that the method is effective for genus-zero implicit surfaces, which will offer a new way for object retrieval and manufactured surface inspection.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Shape similarity assessment methods for spatial surfaces in different poses have been broadly investigated and applied in variousengineering fields, such as Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacture (CAD/CAM), computer graphics, robot vision, and pattern recognition. Currently, two major ways are taken to measure the similarity between surfaces. One way is using a distance after registration (localization, alignment or pose estimation), such as the Euclidean distance, the Minkowski distance, or the Haussdorff distance, between points on one surface and the corresponding closest points on the other. The other way is using the local or global correspondence algorithms, with which the geometric shape properties of surfaces are utilized directly to compare surfaces without fine registration. The similarity metric is usually established based on the geometric shape properties that are invariant and insensitive to rigid transformation.

Implicit surface matching has been widely investigated in 3D object recognition, since implicit equations that describe implicit surfaces are able to elegantly represent complex closed surfaces and analytically calculate surface geometric properties. In general, surfaces are acquired in the format of point sets by some contact-type or optical measurement devices, such as the Coordinate Measurement Machines (CMM), laser tracker systems, and structured-light 3D scanners. The smooth representations of surfaces, such as NURBUS surfaces, have been intensively investigated in the fields such as CAD. Besides this parametric method, another popular smooth representation of surfaces is obtained by using least-square fitting methods, in which the point sets are adequately approximated by algebraic equations. One of the most popular least-square fitting approaches is to fit implicit polynomial (IP) surfaces to point sets  [1]. The IP surface is a surface represented by a zero set of a polynomial, which is one of the most available and valuable representations. Its representation ability is supported by smoothing noisy point sets, interpolating missing data, and depicting both open and closed surfaces. The geometric properties of the implicit surfaces can be effectively and accurately calculated in the procedures of surface alignment, surface recognition, etc. For instance, by using the implicit equation representation, it is convenient to determine the algebraic distance from a point to a surface and to check whether the point is on the surface or not. Numerous improvements of implicit polynomial fitting method are proposed, which make the surface representation more effective, robust, and accurate.

Global one-to-one correspondence between implicit surfaces in dissimilar shapes can hardly be guaranteed by using existing rigid registration methods. Most researches on implicit surface matching are concentrated on the alignment or pose estimation based on algebraic equations, which are primarily suitable for the matching of surfaces in similar shapes. Different target distance functions result in different shape similarity metrics that are sensitive to rigid transformation, though optimal alignment of two surfaces in pose can provide a minimized distance for shape difference measurement. The surface registration is a distance-based optimization process, in which the correspondence relationship is described by the closest point pairs. With the registration methods, the similarity comparison between surfaces in dissimilar shapes can hardly be robustly performed. Global one-to-one correspondence is a key issue in surface matching, since it can be used for comparison between surfaces in similar shapes or dissimilar shapes.

Global one-to-one correspondence between surfaces can be achieved by using the theory of conformal mapping  [2]. However, existing approaches on conformal mapping are mainly proposed for surfaces represented by triangle meshes. Few methods of conformal mapping are introduced in the implicit surface matching. Moreover, few analytical representation methods for conformal mapping have been proposed in the related work. For the implicit surfaces that are represented by algebraic equations, one-to-one correspondence between surfaces can be described in a continuous manner, and even can be expressed by analytical functions to reveal the intrinsic principle of the point-correspondence relationship between implicit surfaces.

In this study, the conformal mapping is introduced to the implicit surface matching and an analytical model of conformal mapping is developed. Based on the conformal mapping, a shape similarity assessment index for implicit surfaces is established. By using existing triangulation methods for implicit surfaces, one of the two implicit surfaces is firstly discretized by a ‘well-shaped’ triangle mesh, for it is hard to determine conformal mapping directly between arbitrary-shape implicit surfaces. Then, one of the existing conformal mapping methods for mesh surfaces is exploited in the matching between the mesh and the implicit surface, where a polynomial-function mapping is constructed. The optimal polynomial-function mapping is approximately considered as the conformal mapping between the original two implicit surfaces. Finally, a shape similarity assessment index for implicit surfaces is established by calculating the differences between shape index values of all the corresponding points on the two surfaces.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Related research work on shape similarity comparison between general 3D objects is introduced in Section  2. Some preliminaries or mathematical backgrounds of our method are addressed in Section  3. An analytical representation method for conformal mapping between two implicit surfaces and a shape similarity assessment index are both proposed in Section  4. Cases of the determination of conformal mapping for closed genus-zero IP surfaces and some discussions are presented in Section  5. Conclusions are drawn in Section  6.

In this section, related research on shape similarity comparison between surfaces is introduced. The section contains three aspects: the implicit model recognition, shape analysis using conformal mapping and the general 3D object recognition. The first aspect is focused on the recognition methods for objects represented or modeled by zero sets of polynomials. The second refers to graceful and insightful geometric approaches for one-to-one and onto mapping between surfaces and their applications. The third concerns the recognition algorithms for freeform objects represented by points, meshes, parametric expressions, etc. In the general 3D object recognition, some techniques of the registration or extraction of invariants can be helpful for the establishment of shape similarity assessment method for implicit surfaces.

The IP curve/surface is represented by a zero set of polynomial with two or three variables in any degree. The implicit curve/surface primarily refers to the IP curve or surface in our study. Existing methods for implicit curve/surface recognition include the extraction of invariants based on IP expressions and the alignment of two IP models. The IP curve/surface recognition techniques have also been investigated in manufacture inspection engineering  [3–5] besides in computer engineering.

Invariants are good descriptors for object recognition. There are local invariants (e.g., curvature) determined by the local behavior of the curve or surface and global invariants depending on all the points of the object. For instance, algebraic invariants are expressed as simple explicit functions with respect to polynomial coefficients  [6].

One of the earliest algorithms about shape similarity comparison or recognition of IP curves or surfaces was proposed by Subranmonia et al.  [7]. Algebraic invariants of IP models were obtained from a probabilistic framework. Distinct methods for object recognition were presented according to different representations of IP expressions. Unel et al.  [8] and Tarel et al.  [9] introduced a method for pose estimation and object matching based on the complex representation of 2D IP curves. The tensor representation  [10] of the IP coefficients was utilized to establish an intrinsic center vector and an intrinsic orientation matrix, by which translation vector and rotation matrix between two IP surfaces can be derived in a closed-form manner. The distance between the aligned surfaces was used to measure shape similarity. Besides, Ben-Yaacov et al.  [11] utilized the tensor representation of IPs to derive rotation invariants in closed-form expressions. Surface recognition was performed after pose estimation based on the method of IP recognition of its 2D projections. Wolovich et al.  [12], Unel et al.  [13,14], and Tarel et al.  [15] performed the decomposition of IPs, on one hand to establish intrinsic feature points, which provided the corresponding relations between points on two IP surfaces for IP curve/surface alignment, and on the other hand to construct invariants, which can be used to perform surface recognition directly. In addition, Unel et al.  [16] proposed a method for 3D object recognition based on the comparison of invariants of their 2D projection curves fitted by IP equations.

Other work did not directly handle the IP expressions. Ünsalan  [17] proposed pose estimation and rotation invariant object matching methods based on IP modeling of the data sets. He directly presented a least square based rigid transformation parameter estimation method. In addition, some iterative algorithms for IP surface shape comparison were presented. Zheng et al.  [18,19] proposed an IP surface registration algorithm based on minimization of energy function of approximate distances by using IP gradient field. Furthermore, they  [20] recently presented a coarse-to-fine method with multiple IPs from low degree to high degree in order to improve the accuracy and the robustness for IP surface registration. Another similar registration method was proposed by means of the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm  [21].

Existing methods for implicit curve/surface recognition are mainly focused on the extraction of invariants and the pose estimation according to algebraic equations. Little work has been performed by using geometric methods to conduct shape difference comparison between implicit surfaces. It is attractive to assess shape similarity between implicit surfaces from the viewpoint of surface geometric structure, though surfaces represented by implicit equations provide excellent analytical expressions that can be utilized to determine local and global geometric properties continuously. To establish one-to-one correspondence between points on two surfaces is a critical link in the surface comparison pipeline, which is also valuable in the effectiveness and unification of the comparison between surfaces in arbitrary shapes. Therefore in this study, the shape similarity assessment between implicit surfaces can be basically perceived as achieving some one-to-one mapping technique from geometric point.

In the past decade, the computational conformal geometry has been extensively and deeply investigated by Xianfeng David Gu’s research team. The aim is to compute parameterization canonical domains for surfaces represented by triangle meshes in arbitrary topologies and shapes. A one-to-one and onto mapping between an arbitrary surface and a universal covering domain can be established using the theory of computational conformal geometry. There are three major approaches for surface conformal mapping which is angle-preserving. They are proposed based on harmonic mapping  [2,22], holomorphic differential forms  [2,23], and discrete surface Ricci flow  [24,25] respectively. The method proposed based on the harmonic mapping, which is obtained by the minimization of global stretching energy, has clear physical meaning and is only suitable for genus-zero surfaces  [22]. Conformal mapping using discrete Ricci flow is a unified approach for arbitrary surfaces, e.g. spherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic surfaces. Recently, a general framework for discrete surface Ricci flow  [26] and state-of-the-art numerical computation algorithms for surface conformal mappings  [27] are presented.

It is reasonable to apply conformal geometry to 3D shape matching and recognition, for one-to-one and onto correspondence between surfaces can be established. A computationally efficient shape matching framework using least-square conformal maps was proposed  [28], which simplified the 3D surface matching problem to a 2D image matching problem and is mainly suitable for 3D faces and genus-zero brains. A general framework for 3D analysis was presented using surface Ricci flow  [29], which also converted all 3D problems into 2D domains. Li et al.  [30] proposed a segmentation and local mapping approach for arbitrary surface matching. For direct corresponding between two surfaces to be matched, some brilliant research works have been performed. Li et al.  [31] attempted to rigorously and numerically compute globally optimal mapping between surfaces in arbitrary topologies. Wu et al.  [32] proposed a framework aiming at determine a conformal mapping directly in a 3D-to-3D manner, efficiently avoiding local optimum caused by the closest-point search and potential difficulties when dealing with intersections, discontinuity along partition boundaries, etc.

Most of the existing conformal mapping methods are presented for the parameterization of a surface into a canonical domain in a discrete manner, for the surface in arbitrary shape can be represented by a triangle mesh. Although sufficient number of triangles can approximate a smooth surface, more computational time will be consumed in geometric processing. While numerous approaches and algorithms are proposed for surface matching in a discrete sense, other eyes also ought to be focused on the matching of surfaces represented by analytical functions or equations, for these facilitate the efficient and accurate computation of surface geometric properties, e.g., curvatures and distances from points to a surface.

The 3D object recognition/inspection is to measure shape similarity or dimension error between a selected object and a preserved one. The objects can be in arbitrary shapes and represented in any formats. In this subsection, the survey on 3D object recognition is mainly concentrated on the freeform objects/surfaces  [33]. A number of algorithms for freeform object shape comparison are established based on registration, which can be termed localization, alignment, pose estimation, etc. For two surfaces both represented by point sets, a celebrated registration algorithm called the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) was proposed  [34,35]. For the comparison between a point set and a parametric surface, numerous effective registration algorithms were proposed and commonly applied in the industrial inspection field  [36–39]. Li et al.  [40] presented a comprehensive literature review of methodologies, techniques, and various processes of inspections of parts with freeform surfaces. Another category of algorithms for the surface shape comparison was proposed according to intrinsic signatures/descriptors of surfaces  [41,42].

For the searching of point correspondence before fine registration and the establishment of point or surface signatures, there are various methods for extraction of surface local and global invariants  [43,44]. Among them, invariants based on differential geometry are naturally focused on in the literature. In Ref.  [45], local and global evaluation methods for the shape error of freeform surfaces were presented. The changes in the principal curvatures are utilized in the local evaluation method. The aggregate normal vectors for the characterization of the representative direction of the portion of surfaces are used in the global evaluation method. In Ref.  [46], the local invariants or intrinsic shape properties of surfaces, e.g. Gaussian and mean curvatures, were regarded as object features for registration. In Ref.  [47], the integral of Gaussian curvature was utilized to measure the shape similarity of freeform surfaces without registration. In addition, for the 3D objects represented by polyhedrons, there are also many algorithms for shape similarity comparison. One method was proposed based on Euclidean distance between the local curvature distributions over the mesh representations of two objects  [48]. Other improving algorithms for deciding the similarity of polyhedral objects were presented by Sun et al.  [49] and Mukai et al.  [50].

In the existing approaches of shape similarity comparison between 3D objects, curvatures and their combinations, which describe local shape information of a surface, have been broadly employed. This provides a reference for developing a shape similarity assessment method for implicit surfaces. The curvature formulas for object surfaces fitted by implicit algebraic equations can also be obtained in a closed form, though they are commonly derived for explicit parametric surfaces. This is valuable in the calculation of local geometric properties of IP surfaces for surface recognition or comparison.

The implicit polynomial surface fitting aims at finding the best polynomial that describes the point set by means of its zero set. The value of the polynomial function should reach zero at the location of the given data points. A fitting criterion is utilized to measure the closeness of the zero set to the given point set, which is also expressed by a residual error as

                         points. This error is referred to as the algebraic distance. Obviously, another kind of error is the geometric distance, which is the sum of squares of orthogonal distances between given points and the zero set of the polynomial. However, the orthogonal distance between a point and an algebraic surface cannot be analytically obtained. Generally, it is computed by the non-linear iteration algorithm. Therefore, in the implicit polynomial fitting algorithm, the algebraic distance is employed when computation efficiency is a priority, and the geometric distance is utilized when the fitting accuracy is most required. For both efficiency and accuracy, other fitting residual errors were proposed based on approximate distance  [1], simple distance estimation  [51], etc.

Around the year 2000, an effective, stable, and high-degree available algorithm for fitting implicit polynomial curves/surfaces to data was first proposed by Blanne et al.  [52]. This algorithm is called the

                         is a diagonal matrix  [53]. Moreover, in order to improve the accuracy of the 
                           3
                           L
                         algorithm, an algorithm  [54] was proposed in recent years, in which the additional constraints are released so that the 
                           ±
                           c
                         values in 
                           
                              b
                           
                         are independently adjusted for each point. If only one polynomial is employed to approximate the acquired point data of an object surface, the global fitting accuracy can hardly be guaranteed for an arbitrary and complex object, although the degree of the polynomial is sufficiently high. Therefore, an IP-segment representation method  [55] was proposed by Zheng et al.

In this section, an analytical representation of conformal mapping for genus-zero implicit surfaces is developed, which provides continuous and global one-to-one correspondence between the points on two surfaces. A shape similarity assessment index is established by calculating the difference of shape index values of the corresponding points. Our general ideas for developing the analytical model of conformal mapping between two implicit surfaces are shown in Fig. 1
                     . By using the existing triangulation methods for implicit surface  [57,58], one of two implicit surfaces is firstly discretized by a ‘well-shaped’ triangle mesh, as it is hard to determine the analytical conformal mapping directly between two implicit surfaces in arbitrary shapes according to their algebraic equations. A polynomial-function mapping from the mesh to the other implicit surface is constructed. One of the existing conformal mapping methods for mesh surfaces is exploited in the matching between the mesh and the implicit surface, which is the harmonic mapping obtained by minimizing a stretch energy. The optimal polynomial-function mapping is approximately considered as the conformal mapping between the original two implicit surfaces. Additionally, all the surfaces in this work are assumed to be orientable, compatible, closed and genus-zero.

In this subsection, an optimization algorithm is developed for the minimization of the discrete harmonic energy  [59,60], which is established based on the polynomial-function mapping from a mesh surface to an implicit surface. A few key steps of the algorithm are shown in Fig. 2
                        . The two surfaces to be matched are firstly preprocessed by repositioning, scaling, and reorientation. A polynomial-function mapping 
                           
                              φ
                           
                         from the preprocessed mesh surface to the preprocessed implicit surface is constructed. The discrete harmonic energy model 
                           E
                         is then developed based on the total stretch energy among all image points under the polynomial-function mapping 
                           
                              φ
                           
                        .

In the optimization of the discrete harmonic energy, some equality constraints are added to ensure that the image points appear on the implicit surface and also the obtained mapping be unique. As Gu et al.  [22] indicated, in order to determine a unique solution under the Möbius transformation, some constraints have to be added. The first constraint is the above mentioned preprocessing of two surfaces, which provides the preferable intimal conditions for the iteration optimization and makes the final result a local minimum with Newton method. The second one is the zero center constraint, which means the center of the preprocessed Surface

                                       ̄

                         should be coincident with the center of the preprocessed Surface 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                    
                                    
                                       ̄

                        . This constraint can be satisfied if the above preprocessing is implemented and the image points are all on Surface 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S

                        . The last but not least is the landmark constraint. We select sufficient points on a closed curve (i.e. the landmark curve) obtained by cutting the preprocessed Surface

                         denotes the coordinate value of a point. Lagrange multipliers are employed to establish a Lagrange optimization model 
                           L
                         according to the abovementioned constraint equations. Finally, by taking the identity mapping as the initial mapping, the optimization model

                         is solved with the Newton method, thus the optimization result is attained at the local minimum of the harmonic energy, and a unique mapping is obtained under abovementioned constraints that are the repositioning, reorientation, scaling, zero-center constraint, and landmark constraint.

At the first step of this algorithm, surfaces should be preprocessed to achieve preferable initial conditions for the iteration optimization process. Assume that sufficient points

                         is the direction cosine matrix of the local body-fixed frame on the surface relative to the global frame and is determined as follows. The directions of three coordinate axes of the local frame can be obtained by calculating the areas of three orthogonal planes that intersect at one corner point of the bounding box. In this method, we use the normal of the plane with the maximum area among the three as the direction of X axis and the normal of that with the minimum area as the direction of Z axis. Moreover, we determine their positive directions by comparing them with the direction from box center

In the above subsection, the global and continuous one-to-one correspondence between implicit surfaces is established. In this subsection, the shape similarity between implicit surfaces is measured by comparing all the local geometric properties of corresponding points on the two surfaces. The shape index  [44], which is the local shape property of a surface, is exploited in this paper and rewritten as

The mathematical models of conformal mapping and shape similarity assessment for the implicit surfaces are presented in Section  4. In this section, based on the models, the algorithm for the cases is programmed in MATLABTM language and conducted on the Macbook with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4258U CPU @2.4 GHz and RAM 8G. Some data of point sets or triangle meshes are acquired from AIM@SHAPE.

                      This section contains two parts. In the first part, an ordinary case for the determination of the conformal mapping from an ellipsoid to a unit sphere is presented. In the second part, the final simulation results of the other cases for complex IP surfaces are presented and visualized. The degrees of the polynomial functions used to approximate conformal mappings are set by trial and error in our experiments, and are generally more than 5. In most cases, the higher the degrees of polynomial functions are, the closer the obtained mappings are to be conformal, but more computational time will be consumed. The detailed expressions of analytical functions of conformal mappings are not presented in this section, for they are pretty complex. In addition, in order to check how the obtained mapping is close to be conformal, we define the angle distortion ratio as follows:

An implicit surface is discretized by a triangle mesh that contains a lot of vertices and triangle faces. In general, the more vertices the surface has, the closer the obtained mapping is to be conformal, but much more computational time will be consumed. In our cases, the number of vertices of a triangle mesh is moderately set as about 2000. In our simulations, the sparse matrix function, sparse(), in MATLAB is utilized to create or convert matrices to large sparse matrices. Eq. (17), which is actually a large sparse linear system, is solved by the method analogous to Eq. (5). The back slash instead of the inverse operator in MATLAB language is utilized to solve Eq. (5). The iteration stopping criteria is that the norm of gradient, which is the right side of Eq. (17), should be less than 0.05 or the difference of norms of gradients in the adjacent iteration steps should be less than 0.025.

In this subsection, the conformal mapping from an ellipsoid to a unit sphere is determined. The ellipsoid is represented by a quadratic algebraic equation denoted by the equation

For this case, the degrees of polynomial functions are set as 7 and the identity mapping is taken as the initial mapping. The parameters and results for the simulation of the conformal mapping from the ellipsoid to the sphere are listed in the second row of Table 1
                        . It takes 4 iteration steps and about 43 s to achieve the local minimum of discrete harmonic energy. The obtained mapping is conformal as the angle distortion ratio is 0.0216. The obtained conformal mapping, which is one-to-one correspondence between points on the ellipsoid and points on the unit sphere, is visualized in Fig. 4. The conformal mapping image on the unit sphere is shown in Fig. 5
                         involving shape index distribution information on the original ellipsoid.

In this subsection, we tested the algorithm on ten genus-zero IP surfaces that are shown in the first column of Fig. 6
                        . Three of them, which are the rounded octahedron, the tooth surface and the McMüllen K3 surface, can be expressed in simple implicit polynomial equations. Others are those roughly fitted to mesh data that are acquired from AIM@SHAPE shape repository by using the

                         (see Eq. (13)), is taken as the initial mapping for the spherical, the elliptic, and the cubic parameterizations. Namely, in the initial step of the iteration algorithm, surfaces are mapped onto themselves. The simulations are converged and the computed mapping images are visualized in the second, the third and the fourth column of Fig. 6, respectively, where the colors of points on the surfaces refer to the shape index values of surfaces at any points. Therefore, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified. For all the cases, the analytical expressions of the obtained conformal mappings are complex and thus not presented in this paper. The results for computing the conformal mapping from genus-zero IP surfaces to the sphere, the ellipsoid and the cube are shown in Tables 1–3
                        
                        , respectively. In order to analyze the appropriate degrees of polynomial functions for the spherical conformal mapping of IP surfaces, experiments are conducted about the accuracy analysis for the conformal mappings from the IP surfaces to the sphere considering different polynomial degrees. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 7
                        , according to which the appropriate degrees of polynomials are set and shown in Table 1.

Based on the obtained one-to-one correspondence between points on the IP surfaces and those on the sphere, the ellipsoid, or the rounded hexahedron, the values of shape similarity assessment index are calculated by using Eq. (21) and shown in the last columns of Tables 1–3. The results show that the octahedron is most similar to the sphere, the ellipsoid or the cube among the ten given genus-zero closed surfaces; the apple surface is more similar to the sphere than to the ellipsoid or the cube; the synthetic surface 1 is more similar to the ellipsoid than to the sphere or the cube; and the tooth surface is more similar to the cube than to the sphere or the ellipsoid. However, this is a coarse comparison of shape similarity between surfaces, for only a local solution for minimizing harmonic energy between implicit surfaces is obtained. If the global solution without the consideration of landmark is obtained, the proposed similarity assessment index could be also used for the fine comparison of shape similarity between surfaces, which ought to be invariant to rigid transformation.

Furthermore, by using the existing spherical parameterization method  [22,63] proposed completely for mesh surfaces, the triangle meshes of these IP surfaces are mapped to the unit sphere. Their mapping images are shown in the last column of Fig. 6, which are almost the same as the corresponding ones in the second column. Simulation results of the spherical parameterization completely for the meshes of the IP surfaces are shown in Table 4
                        . In the cases for meshes, we develop a simple method to obtain an appropriate and folding-free initial mapping for the spherical parameterization algorithm  [22,63]. Firstly, we utilize the method illustrated in Section  4.1 to conduct the repositioning, the reorientation and the scaling of the meshes. Secondly, similar to the landmark constraint method, we create a spatial closed polyline and project it onto the X–Y plane. The obtained 2D closed polyline is mapped to the planar unit circle by performing the 2D version of our algorithm for computing the analytical representation of conformal mapping, in which the identity mapping is also taken as the initial mapping. Thirdly, the vertices of the meshes except those on the segmentation polyline are mapped to a planar unit disc by using the discrete harmonic mapping method  [60]. Finally, the harmonic mapping image points on the planar disc are mapped to the unit sphere by using the stereographic projection method.

Simulation results in Tables 1 and 4 show that the obtained spherical mappings for the IP surfaces (especially, Nos. 0, 1, 2, 4, 9 and 10) by using our method are close to be conformal as those by using spherical parameterization method for meshes. Results in Fig. 6 show that our method is suitable for the determination of mapping from complex surfaces to some relatively-simple canonical surfaces, while the existing parameterization methods are mainly proposed for the mapping from arbitrary mesh to the sphere. This is because the target surface is represented by implicit equation and equality constraints are added in the iterative optimization algorithm of this method. In addition, we find that, for some round-shape surface such as the surfaces of Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 9, the obtained mappings from them to the sphere are closer to be conformal than those to the ellipsoid or cube. For some long-shape surfaces such as the surfaces of Nos. 3, 6 and 7, the obtained mappings from them to the ellipsoid are closer to be conformal than those to the sphere. For the cubic-shape surface such as the surface of No. 10, the obtained mapping from it to the cube are closer to be conformal than that to the sphere. Therefore, the experimental results also show that the appropriate canonical domain for the conformal parameterization depends on the shape of a surface.

Our method can also be employed in the determination of conformal mapping from complete mesh surfaces to the sphere. We tested the method on two mesh surfaces that are the complex bunny (1889 vertices) and the bolt (1967 vertices). Some of the experimental results are shown in Fig. 8
                        . The middle column of Fig. 8 shows the spherical images of the two surfaces obtained by using our method. The right column shows those obtained by using existing spherical parameterization method. The simulation results show that the spherical images obtain by using our method are almost the same as those obtained by the spherical parameterization method for meshes. However, in the highly dense region of the image such as the complex bunny’s ears, the mapping obtained by using our method cannot guarantee one-to-one correspondence. This also happens for two or three images in Fig. 6, for generally, the algebraic polynomial function approximation method may not work in the local region with highly dense points and it can only guarantee the one-to-one correspondence as a whole. In the future, more complex and accurate functions could be utilized to exactly approximate the one-to-one mapping for the dense region.

In addition, our method can be applied to the determination of conformal mapping from a complex mesh to a complex implicit surface, in the case that the mesh is similar to the implicit surface. We test the method on two implicit surfaces and the results are shown in Fig. 9
                        , where the source surfaces are the meshes (Fig. 9(a): 1905 vertices, Fig. 9(b): 1958 vertices), the target surfaces are the implicit surfaces (Fig. 9(a): degree-10 IP surface, Fig. 9(b): degree-8 IP surface) represented by meshes (i.e. obtained conformal mapping results), and colors of points on the surfaces refer to the signed distances from the points on the meshes to their corresponding ones on the implicit surfaces. The sign distances are obtained after the quaternion-based best registration  [64] of the meshes to the implicit surfaces, where positive/negative distances mean the points on the meshes are outside/inside the closed implicit surfaces. The two cases can also be regarded as the manufactured surface inspection. By using this method, the real manufactured surface, which can be acquired by scanning and represented by mesh, is mapped onto the theoretical surface represented by implicit equation, where global one-to-one correspondence between points on the scanned surface and those on the theoretical surface can be guaranteed.

In this study, we concentrate on the effective determination of conformal mapping expressed by analytical functions for genus-zero implicit surfaces. Meanwhile, we find that the initial mapping could not be arbitrarily constructed, otherwise the simulation is time-consuming and even an incorrect solution is obtained. For the complex surfaces with long and thin branches, Gaussian mapping results have flip-overs. Therefore, when taking the Gaussian mapping as the initial mapping, the obtained harmonic map can have flip-overs. In the recent paper of Lai et al.  [65], a method was proposed that iteratively removes flip-overs by taking advantages of the weighted Laplace–Beltrami eigen-projection, though the Gaussian mapping was taken as the initial mapping in the harmonic energy optimization algorithm. Floater et al.  [62] indicated that the obtained harmonic mapping from a triangle mesh to a planar domain can guarantee one-to-one correspondence between points on a mesh and those on the plane, if the triangle mesh is well-shaped. However, global one-to-one and onto (bijective) mappings from complex surfaces to simple closed surfaces and those directly between two dissimilar complex surfaces cannot be easily obtained. Related methods for obtaining the bijective mappings (without consideration of the artificial method  [23]) have rarely been reported. Recently, Schneider et al.  [66] and Lai et al.  [65] respectively proposed the methods for obtaining the folding-free global bijective mappings. Wan et al.  [67] presented an effective spherical mapping algorithm by which a bijective and lowly-distorted mapping was generated. They tested the algorithm on some complex shapes, and demonstrated that the spherical mapping results had no flip-overs. Besides, Wan et al.  [68] utilized a polycube as the regular and simple intermediate domain for the parameterization of a complex shape. In the future, we will also intensively investigate to obtain a global conformal mapping for complex implicit surfaces with long and thin branches, and to introduce the discrete conformal mapping method to the matching between two complex piecewise implicit surfaces in an analytical manner.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

An analytical representation method of conformal mapping for genus-zero implicit surfaces is developed based on algebraic polynomial functions. Global and continuous one-to-one correspondence between two surfaces is described by the analytical conformal mapping functions. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by the simulation cases for the closed genus-zero implicit surfaces. The main contribution of this work is the novel representation method of conformal mapping between two genus-zero implicit surfaces. Our method is suitable for the determination of conformal mapping from complex surfaces to some simple canonical surfaces besides the commonly-used sphere, and can also be applied to the determination of conformal mapping from a complex mesh to a complex implicit surface, in the case that the mesh is similar to the implicit surface. In the future, we will try to generalize our method to determine the analytical representation of conformal mapping for complex piecewise implicit surfaces or implicit surfaces of non-zero genus, and apply it to computer-aided inspection of manufactured surface.
