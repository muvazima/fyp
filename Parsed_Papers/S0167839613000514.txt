                  This paper is devoted to introducing a new approach for computing the topology of a real algebraic plane curve presented either parametrically or defined by its implicit equation when the corresponding polynomials which describe the curve are known only “by values”. This approach is based on the replacement of the usual algebraic manipulation of the polynomials (and their roots) appearing in the topology determination of the given curve with the computation of numerical matrices (and their eigenvalues). Such numerical matrices arise from a typical construction in Elimination Theory known as the Bézout matrix which in our case is specified by the values of the defining polynomial equations on several sample points.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The problem of computing the graph (even topologically) of an implicitly defined algebraic plane curve has received special attention from both Computer Aided Geometric Design and Symbolic Computation, independently. For the Computer Aided Geometric Design community, this problem is a basic subproblem appearing often in practice (see, for example, Bajaj et al., 1988; Keyser et al., 2000; Song et al., 2004; Farouki et al., 2005 or Hass et al., 2007). For the Symbolic Computation community, on the other hand, this problem has been the motivation for many achievements in the study of subresultants, symbolic real root counting, infinitesimal computations, etc. By a comparison between the seminal papers Arnon and McCallum (1988); Gianni and Traverso (1983); Roy (1996); Sakkalis (1991); Cellini et al. (1991); Cucker et al. (1991); Feng (1992) and Roy and Szpirglas (1990) and the more renewed works of Gonzalez-Vega and El Kahoui (1996), Hong (1996), Gonzalez-Vega and Necula (2002), Busé et al. (2005), Seidel and Wolpert (2005), Eigenwillig et al. (2007), Lionel et al. (2008), Kerber (2009), Alcázar and Díaz-Toca (2010) and Cheng et al. (2010), one can see how the theoretical and practical complexities of the algorithms dealing with this problem have been dramatically improved.

This paper is devoted to introducing a new family of methods for determining the topology of a real algebraic plane curve presented either parametrically, 
                        (
                        x
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        ,
                        y
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                     , or defined by its implicit equation 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                        =
                        0
                     . The main difference between our approach and those previously mentioned is the fact that here we completely replace the algebraic manipulation of the polynomials (and their roots) with computations of numerical matrices (and their eigenvalues). This is motivated by the fact that we prefer to deal with numerical matrices of moderate size instead of high degree polynomials. This is typically a better strategy from the numerical point of view when the coefficients of the polynomials in the parametrization 
                        (
                        x
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        ,
                        y
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                      or of the implicit equation 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                        =
                        0
                      are floating point real numbers.

But there is a stronger motivation behind the new approach to be introduced here. In many practical situations the polynomial 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                      or the polynomials in 
                        (
                        x
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        ,
                        y
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                      appear presented in a non-expanded form which if expanded in the standard monomial basis produce polynomials of high degree, with big coefficients whose manipulation is a difficult task. For example, when computing the intersection of two surfaces, or when computing offset curves (for more examples see Diaz-Toca et al., 2013). Otherwise, if the polynomials describing the considered curve are presented by their values then they can be easily evaluated at any desired point with a reasonable computational cost. This is our starting point: we do not assume that we have an explicit description (in the standard monomial basis) of the polynomial 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                      or of the polynomials in 
                        (
                        x
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        ,
                        y
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                     . We do only require, first, the knowledge of an upper bound for the degree of the polynomials which describe the considered real algebraic plane curve and second, the mathematical tools to evaluate those polynomials at any desired point.

Another application of the approach presented in this paper is to generate the points of an offset curve which is at distance δ from a parametric curve 
                        (
                        x
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        ,
                        y
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                      described by its values. Typically, the implicit equation of such an offset curve is either complicated to compute or is a dense bivariate polynomial of big size. A point 
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                      is on the offset if, for some t, the following equations are verified:

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 1, we detail some standard facts about the Bezoutian which is a tool from Elimination Theory. In Section 2, we introduce the linearization tools which are going to be used to determine the roots of the determinant of a matrix polynomial without computing the determinant. In other words, instead of computing the determinant and then its roots we compute the so-called generalized eigenvalues of a matrix pencil (in this context known as the companion matrix pencil). In Section 3, we give an explicit description of how to compute the Bézout matrix for a pair of univariate polynomials and the companion matrix pencil associated with a matrix polynomial, in the Lagrange polynomial basis. In Section 4, we summarize the standard strategies used for computing the topology of 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                        =
                        0
                     ; we show how algebraic manipulation of polynomials can be replaced with the computation of the Bézout matrix by values and the corresponding generalized eigenvalues. Sections 5 and 6 are devoted to introducing the algorithms for computing the topology of a real algebraic plane curve presented by its implicit equation 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                        =
                        0
                      or by its parametrization 
                        (
                        x
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        ,
                        y
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                      in the Lagrange polynomial basis. Both sections include a detailed description of the corresponding algorithm together with several examples and the results coming from our tests and experimentations. Section 7 shows how to compute the topology of a real algebraic plane curve presented by its parametrization 
                        (
                        x
                        (

                        t
                        )
                        )
                      in the Lagrange polynomial basis by applying the same algorithm used for the implicit equation case in Section 5; in this case it is enough to show how to evaluate the implicit equation 
                        f
                        (
                        x

                        )
                        )
                      without computing 
                        f
                        (
                        x

                        y
                        )
                     , explicitly. In Section 8, we briefly discuss some numerical issues posed by our algorithms. Finally, in Section 9, we summarize the results and highlight several points where we believe our approach can be improved.

Standard definitions of the Bezoutian make explicit reference to the monomial or power basis (see, e.g., Barnett, 1990). However, all constructions of the Bézout matrix make use of the so-called Cayley quotient which makes no reference to any particular basis in which the given polynomials are represented.

The construction of the Bézout matrix using the Cayley quotient in the monomial basis (i.e., power basis) is classic (see for example Barnett, 1990). The computation of the Bézout matrix in the Bernstein and Chebyshev bases have been studied in Bini and Gemignani (2004) and Barnett (1989), respectively.

                     . We may, if we choose, order the construction of the quadratic form for the Bezoutian in such a way as to reverse the row order of the entries of the nullspace.

Finally the next proposition and corollary show how the structure of the nullspace for the Bezoutian can be very helpful to deal with the computation of multiple roots (under certain additional hypothesis).

In this section we review some of the main properties of generalized eigenvalues to be used in the next sections. See Amiraslani et al. (2009), Corless et al. (2007) for a more detailed discussion.

                      There is an extensive literature on such problems; theoretical results about solutions of polynomial eigenvalue problems are available in Gohberg et al. (1982), Manocha and Demmel (1995). Moreover, standard algorithms exist for polynomial eigenvalue problems expressed in the power basis through linearization, i.e., finding an associated pair of companion matrices that defines a generalized eigenvalue problem. The finite generalized eigenvalues of such a pair are exactly the polynomial eigenvalues of the matrix polynomial

There are several applications of Bézout matrices for bivariate polynomials given by samples in each variable. The natural basis is the tensor product of the Lagrange basis in each variable. Before discussing such applications we review some theories and facts about the Lagrange interpolation problem (for the proofs and a more detailed discussion see Shakoori, 2007; Corless, 2004). We consider the so-called barycentric representation of the Lagrange basis which is known to have numerical advantages over the familiar standard definition (see Berrut and Trefethen, 2004; Schneider and Werner, 1984 and Section 8 below).

As we showed in Proposition 4, to compute the diagonal entries of the Bézout matrix in the Lagrange basis, we need to calculate

                              ′

                              q
                           
                           
                              i
                           
                           
                              ′
                           
                        
                      (

                        d
                     ). In fact, we need to have a systematic way of computing all the derivatives of the polynomial interpolant on the given sample points. Next we introduce a formula which is the main tool in computing the diagonal entries of the Bézout matrix in the Lagrange basis.

                            because the sum interpolates t. By replacing the right hand sides of Eqs. (18) and (19) in Eq. (17), the proof is complete.  □

Although the purpose of the present paper is not to discuss methods for solving generalized eigenvalue problems, we will make some brief considerations in Section 8.

The goal of this section is to recall the main ideas of the usual method for computing the topology of algebraic curves, from which our method has, in some sense, evolved. This will make the exposition clearer, and the paper self-contained. The characterization of the topology of a curve

                      is usually based on the location of the critical points of f with respect to y (i.e., singular points or points with a vertical tangent) and on the study of the halfbranches (i.e., simple arcs of curve starting from a point) of

Steps 1 and 2 provide the vertices of a graph representing the topology of

                      such as the one in Fig. 3. For the purpose of tracing the curve numerically, this graph is of much importance because it helps us understand how to proceed when we approach a complicated point on the curve.

In this section we summarize two usual different approaches for solving steps 1 and 2. The main difference between the two approaches is that in the method we choose in order to determine the x-coordinates of the critical points: we can either choose to explicitly compute the discriminant of 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                      with respect to y, or we can avoid such computation. Although these two methods use the monomial expression of 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                     , their presentation here is necessary to understand the rationale behind the method presented in Section 5 in which we do not have the monomial expression of 
                        f
                        (
                        x

If the curve is not in generic position then we apply the linear change of coordinates

                         and restart the process with the new polynomial. Alternatively, one may apply a rotation with a randomly chosen angle between 0 and π. After a finite number of such transformations the curve will be in generic position. Notice that these changes of coordinates do not modify the topology of the curve, and the transformation can be reversed at the end.

                                 (
                                 −
                                 1
                                 ,
                                 −
                                 2
                                 )
                               and 
                                 (
                                 −
                                 1
                                 ,
                                 2
                                 )
                               with algebraic multiplicity 2, and 
                                 (
                                 −
                                 1
                                 ,
                                 0
                                 )
                               with multiplicity 0. Similarly for 
                                 x
                                 =
                                 1
                               (see Fig. 1
                              , left). Thus, the curve is not in generic position. On the other hand, for 
                                 α
                                 =
                                 ±
                                 6.236475953965871
                              , the y-coordinate of the only double point is the complex number 
                                 β
                                 =
                                 8.688945478749457
                                 i
                              .

If one transforms the polynomial using (22) then the leading coefficient with respect to y annihilates at 
                                 x
                                 =
                                 0
                              , and the first condition in the generic position definition is not satisfied (see Fig. 1, center). By applying the transformation (22) once more, we obtain the curve in generic position (see Fig. 1, right).

The third step is accomplished by computing the number of real roots of the squarefree polynomials

                      is assumed to be in generic position (see Section 4.1); later in Section 5.5 we present a method for checking whether or not a given curve is in generic position, in this context. As usual, we will also demonstrate that by making a simple linear change of coordinates we put the curve in generic position, if not already in such a position.

We recall that the Bézout matrix of a pair of bivariate polynomials is a matrix polynomial. Therefore, each entry of such Bézout matrix is a univariate polynomial. The following proposition presents a degree bound for the polynomial entries of the Bézout matrix of

The first problem is solved by increasing the number of precision digits, and repeating the computation of the generalized eigenvalues.

In some cases, the nongeneric position of the curve is detected when certifying the critical points (see 5.2.1). In other cases, one has to check conditions 1 and 2 in Definition 7. To check the first condition, for each generalized eigenvalue α we must determine that the leading coefficient of 
                           f
                           (
                           x

                           y
                           )
                         with respect to y does not vanish when 
                           x
                           =
                           α
                        . To obtain the leading coefficient we use the following proposition whose proof follows directly from Definition 4.

If the precision has been increased sufficiently (up to 200 digits) but the desired condition is not yet satisfied conclude that the curve is not in generic position. In this case, apply a linear transformation as explained in Section 5.5 and restart the algorithm with the transformed polynomial.

                               has 53 terms and degree 10. The curve is in generic position, but the Top algorithm has trouble checking the generic position. Note, that there are two consecutive critical points whose x-coordinates are rather close, as it can be seen in the right hand side image of Fig. 4. In addition, depending on the precision, the topology obtained with the Top algorithm may be wrong.

The corresponding examples have been chosen from Manocha and Demmel (1995), Gonzalez-Vega and Necula (2002) and Labs (2010). The graphs of these examples are presented in Figs. 5 and 6
                        
                        . To show that the curve of Example 5 has three closed components, we show two zoom views of details in Fig. 7
                        . This example illustrates the accuracy of the method since it distinguish different critical points which are very close to each other. It is clear that most of the computation time is taken by the computation of the generalized eigenvalues. The companion matrix pencils are very big, but they are highly structured and sparse. For the testing we have used the Eigenvalues procedure provided by Maple, but an ad-hoc procedure that takes advantage of the sparseness of the companion matrix pencil would considerably improve efficiency.

The topology of the same examples have been computed using the Top algorithm presented in Gonzalez-Vega and Necula (2002). The results are shown in Table 2
                        . The big difference in performance is due to the computation of the generalized eigenvalues. The accuracy of the resulting topology is the same with both algorithms.

In this section we consider the same problem as in Section 5. However, the curves to be considered in this section are neither known implicitly nor by explicit parametric descriptions but defined parametrically only by some data samples (coming from their parameterizations). Let 
                        C
                      be a real curve parametrized by 
                        φ
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        =
                        (

                        (
                        t
                        )
                        ,
                        y
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                        ,
                        t
                        ∈
                        R
                     , where 
                        x
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      and 
                        y
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      are polynomials described by values. In addition, we suppose that the curve is proper. Recall that a parametrization is said to be proper if it is injective for almost all the points of 
                        C
                     . That implies that there is at most a finite number of points of 
                        C
                      generated by more than one value of the parameter t.

Our goal is to obtain the topology of 
                        C
                      assuming that the parameterization is not available or costly to be either computed or used. Instead it is possible to compute their evaluations. Moreover, it is known that the degrees of 
                        x
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      and 
                        y
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      with respect to t are respectively bounded by m and n, and 
                        d
                        =
                        max
                        (
                        m
                        ,
                        n
                        )
                     .

In this section, to compute the topology of planar curves parametrized by polynomials we follow the methodology presented in Alcázar and Díaz-Toca (2010). However, unlike Alcázar and Díaz-Toca (2010), here, we assume that the parameterization is not available or costly to be either computed or used.

The set of the critical points of the curve 
                              C
                            is formed by ramification points and singular points. The ramification points are those points satisfying

Following the above notation, in Pérez-Díaz (2007) one can find the following result which characterizes the singular points of a rational parametrization. To state the result precisely we introduce some notations which are used throughout this section. Let

                                          r
                                          (

                                          )

                                          0
                                        then the parametrization is not proper and so our methodology cannot be applied; else, i.e., 
                                          r
                                          (

                                          0
                                        then, there are no singular points.

There are eigenvalues; in this case, we discard complex non-real and infinite eigenvalues and those remaining are the parameter values which generate the affine singularities of the curve.

To find the ramification points one must solve the following equation
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             x
                                          
                                          
                                             ′
                                          
                                       
                                       (
                                       t
                                       )
                                       =
                                       0
                                       .
                                    
                                 
                               Since we do not have the polynomial expression of 
                                 x
                                 (
                                 t

                               in the monomial basis, to solve this equation we construct the corresponding companion matrix pencil 
                                 (

                                       0
                                    
                                 
                                 ,

                                 )
                               from the values 
                                 
                                    
                                       x
                                    
                                    
                                       ′

                                 )
                               at the nodes. In this case, the companion matrix pencil is of size 
                                 m
                                 +
                                 1
                              . Then, we compute the generalized eigenvalues and discard those complex non-real and infinite.

The coordinates of the critical points are obtained by substituting the values of t in the evaluation formula in Definition 4. We shall take into consideration that those eigenvalues which generate the singular and ramification points must be grouped together. In other words, we need to deal with the eigenvalue clustering problem (i.e., we must distinguish those eigenvalues coming from the same roots). To achieve this goal we follow the methodology introduced in Corless et al. (2002).

Once we obtain the finite real generalized eigenvalues, we then need to compute the coordinates of the corresponding points; to compute the correct number of critical points, we must, on the one hand, obtain the x-coordinates of the critical points, and on the other hand, to identify those points corresponding to self-intersections of the curve. In performing all these tasks, once again, we follow the methodology of Corless et al. (2002).

Whether there are less critical lines than supposed to be because the x-coordinates of critical points have been wrongly separated in Step 3(d) and one or more critical lines have not been computed. Here however, if such lines define the extremes of the graph, the error will not be detected in the last step.

Whether the number of point on a noncritical point is greater than supposed to be (Step 5).

In this section, we present a new approach for computing the topology of a curve specified by its parametrization 
                        (
                        x
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        ,
                        y
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                      in the Lagrange polynomial basis. The main algorithm to be used here is the same presented in Section 5. We show how to evaluate 
                        f
                        (
                        x

                        )
                      without explicitly computing it. These evaluations are essential to the idea of determining the topology of 
                        f
                        (
                        x

                      by using the algorithm presented in Section 5 (see 5.6). To apply such an algorithm we need to evaluate the partial derivative of 
                        f
                        (

Finally, we note that the graph obtained by following this approach can contain isolated points (with real coordinates) generated by complex, non-real values of the parameter t. They are real points on the curve

                      but they are not in the image of the parametrization

                        Example 5
                        We consider the same curve as in Example 4; here, we do not intend to develop the example completely. We only show the main parts of the computation of the topology of a curve by using its implicit equation.

                            From this matrix, we may compute the graph of the curve without the explicit computation of the implicit equation of such a curve. This is the matrix that can be used to evaluate the implicit equation of the curve according to Eq. (43).

In this section we make some short considerations on the numerical methods used in our algorithms.

It is known that the conversion between different polynomial bases can be unstable, and the instability increases with the degree (see, for example, Hermann, 1996). Hence, when the data is given by values, working directly in the Lagrange basis is usually better than working in other bases, even in the Bernstein one (see Berrut and Trefethen, 2004; Higham, 2004; Corless and Watt, 2004; Corless, 2006; Shakoori, 2007).

                      are known. In addition, it is known that the evaluation using the barycentric form is numerically more stable (see Berrut and Trefethen, 2004).

Without a doubt, the crucial step in the presented algorithms is the computation of generalized eigenvalues and for this task, we have used the existing routine in Maple which is quite successful in most cases. The stability of the rootfinding problem for univariate polynomials by way of standard methods to compute eigenvalues of companion matrices has been studied for the monomial basis (see Edelman and Murakami, 1995; Toh and Trefethen, 1994), and for the Bernstein basis (see Jónsson and Vavasis, 2004). For the bivariate case (expressed in the monomial basis), in Jónsson and Vavasis (2005), the authors propose the use of the Macaulay resultant and analyze the error due to roundoff of the QZ method for computing generalized eigenvalues. However we have not found in the literature studies of stability of the QZ method for the matrix pencil in the Lagrange basis. The QZ method requires

                         flops for the arithmetic. However, for our particular structure of the matrix pencil, the storage cost should be

                        Bini, Gemignani and Pan (2005) implemented a fast and numerically stable QR-based algorithm for computing all eigenvalues of a generalized companion matrix, for a class of structured matrices including the kind of companion matrix pencils of a polynomial (
                           r
                           =
                           1
                        ) considered in the present paper. The QR iteration preserves the structure of the matrices. Each iteration requires 
                           O
                           (
                           d
                           )
                         arithmetic operations, using 
                           O
                           (
                           d
                           )
                         memory storage. The method could probably be extended to the computation of eigenvalues of a matrix polynomial.

In Corless (2006), the author extends the results of Corless and Watt (2004) to matrix polynomials expressed in the Lagrange basis, and investigates the effect of the geometry of the nodes on the conditioning of the problem. As in the monomial basis, he points out the importance of the scaling operation. The generalized eigenvalues remain unchanged if in (21) all the blocks 
                           
                              
                                 B
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                         are multiplied by any nonsingular matrix. The last r rows of 
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                         can also be multiplied by any nonsingular matrix without changing the generalized eigenvalues. It is usually advisable to do a suitable scaling to improve accuracy. However, we scaled the sample matrices and the nodes on examples which needed more precision, and we did not appreciate much improvement.

Another issue mentioned in Corless (2006) is the possibility of roots at infinity caused by oversampling. Our algorithms clearly present such a problem and we are studying the use of the dynamic evaluation to solve it.

After eliminating the infinite eigenvalues, it is common to find certain clusters of eigenvalues. The generalized eigenvalues in one of those clusters come from the same root of the determinant of the Bézout matrix. In the complex plane, they appear in a cross or star-shaped distribution, close to each other, with a real point at the center, and the whole cluster is replaced by this real value.

Conditioning of a problem measures the sensitivity of the solution to perturbations of the data. To decide whether a basis is well-conditioned or ill-conditioned one needs estimates of some condition number. Dividing an evaluation condition number by the norm of the derivative gives a rootfinding condition number. For the evaluation of a function, we can use one of the following condition numbers (see Lyche and Peña, 2004). Let 
                           U
                         be a finite-dimensional vector space of functions defined on 
                           Ω
                           ⊂

                        , and let

                         This condition numbers can be used for polynomials represented in the Lagrange basis.

The importance of the geometry is remarked in Corless (2006). The roots inside a region defined by the interpolation nodes tend to be well-conditioned, whilst roots outside this region can be badly conditioned. To take advantage of this observation, when a high precision is needed, we should redefine the nodes inside the region defined by the computed solutions and repeat the computations.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

We have presented several approaches for computing the topology of a given real algebraic plane curve described by its values in the Lagrange polynomial basis. The first algorithm is designed for problems in which the given data corresponds to an implicitly defined algebraic curve. The second algorithm however, is designed to be used for parametric curves. In both cases, the defining polynomial equations are specified only by their values at some sample points. Moreover, the degrees are known, can be deduced or are upper bounded. The key idea is to find the roots of the determinant of a particular Bézout matrix without computing the determinant. This is achieved by computing the generalized eigenvalues of a companion matrix pencil associated with the Bézout matrix. If the precision and other numerical parameters are adjusted appropriately, the algorithms presented here are very accurate. They are also efficient, always in the parametric case, and for moderate degrees in the implicit case. The size of the companion matrix pencil could be quite big in the implicit case, producing an increase in the computational cost.

One of our next goals is to reduce the computational time by using better methods for computing the generalized eigenvalues. These methods should take full advantage of the particular structure of the companion matrix pencil. Using such a particular structure, we also expect to find a practical bound which allows us to confidently discard large generalized eigenvalues as infinite ones. The desired bound for generalized eigenvalues may follow from Hadamardʼs inequality for determinants when applied to the companion matrix pencil in the Lagrange basis (see Corless et al., 2002 for the monomial case).

In addition, it would be interesting to study which properties of curves (normality, for instance) can be determined by values.
