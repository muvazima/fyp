                  Objective
                  To determine the relationship between CD28 polymorphisms, rs3116496, and cancer.
               
               
                  Design
                  Meta-analysis.
               
               
                  Methods
                  PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane library databases were searched to identify studies reporting the association between CD28 polymorphism and cancer. Two authors selected identified studies, extracted, and analyzed the data independently.
               
               
                  Results
                  Individuals carrying a T allele (TT homozygotes and TT+TC heterozygotes) at rs3116496 had a lower incidence of cancer than carriers of a C allele. Subgroup analysis showed that this association held true for Asians, but not Europeans.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  CD28 polymorphism, rs3116496, contributes to cancer susceptibility in the case of multiple cancers.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Tumorigenesis can occur on successful avoidance of immunosurveillance, the immune mechanism that limits tumor occurrence and progression through the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, promotion of differentiation of immunosuppressive cells, and inhibition of immunostimulatory substances [1–6]. Although tumorigenesis can be influenced by multiple factors such as genetic and environmental variations, perturbation of a tightly controlled immune system can greatly increase cancer risk [7–9]. Cell-mediated immunity is a critical antitumor defense mechanism in which cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells are major effectors. CTLs and NK cells use perforin, granzyme, FasL, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand to eradicate tumor cells [10–12]. Genetic variation in genes that govern T cell and NK cell function may contribute to increased susceptibility to cancer [13].

Immune responses are partly regulated by the immunoglobulin superfamily, including antigen receptors, antigen-presenting molecules, coreceptors, costimulatory molecules, and antigen receptor accessory molecules [14]. Costimulatory molecules play crucial roles in regulating T and B cell immune responses and homeostasis [15–19]. In particular, members of the cluster of differentiation (CD) family, including CD28, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, and inducible T-cell costimulator, are major costimulatory molecules [15–20]. CD28 is constitutively expressed on the majority of naïve T cells, while the others are expressed on activated T cells [21–25]. CD28 interacts with B7-1 and B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and induces T cell differentiation and proliferation [15,20,26–30]. In addition, CD28 has been shown to enhance glucose uptake, glycolysis, production of cytokines such as interleukin-2, and cell survival through induction of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-XL [31–42]. Studies have shown that memory T cells require CD28 costimulation for maximal expansion and pathogen clearance, and decreased CD28 expression on peripheral blood T lymphocytes is observed in patients with neoplastic diseases. Thus, CD28-mediated costimulation is critical for T cell proliferation and survival and for the activation of effector functions, including cytolysis of cancer cells [31,43,44].

The human CD28 gene maps to chromosome 2q33 [45] and is composed of four exons encoding the leader, V-like, connecting, transmembrane, and intracytoplasmic regions. Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms in the CD28 gene are associated with autoimmune disorders. For instance, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in rs1980422 or rs3116496 has been linked to rheumatoid arthritis, and an rs3116496 SNP is associated with Bechet׳s disease [5,14,46]. Many studies have examined the association between CD28 polymorphism and cancer incidence in various populations. Polymorphisms in rs1181388, rs1181390, rs3116487, rs3116494, rs3116496, rs3181097, rs3181098, rs3181110, rs3181101, rs3181107, rs3181113, rs3769684, rs3769686, rs4673259, rs10932017, rs12693993, and rs35593994 affect the incidence of breast cancer [15], non-small cell lung cancer [28], cervical cancer [23,47], malignant melanoma [48], colorectal cancer [49], B cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia [50], and other cancer types. In particular, polymorphisms in rs3116496 have been widely studied for their connection to cancer, while polymorphisms in other positions are quite limited in numbers. Nevertheless, the results of the studies reporting the association of rs3116496 polymorphism with cancer have been variable, and the lack of statistical power in most studies has precluded reliable conclusions. Taking into consideration the limitations of a single study and the significant role played by CD28 in the antitumor response, a meta-analysis was performed in order to investigate whether CD28 rs3116496 polymorphisms contribute to cancer susceptibility.

A literature search was conducted in the PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health), EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane library databases using the following terms: (“polymorphism, genetic” or “genetic polymorphism” or “polymorphism” or “variant” or “mutation” or “single nucleotide polymorphism” or “SNP”) and (“neoplasm” or “cancer” or “carcinoma” or “carcinogenesis” or “tumor”) and (“antigen, CD28” or “CD28 antigen” or “CD28” or “cluster of differentiation 28”). All studies published until October 23, 2013, were eligible, and there was no language restriction. All studies that showed an association between the CD28 polymorphism and cancer were retrieved. Additional studies were also found by scanning references citing important studies and reviews. Studies included in the meta-analysis met the following criteria: (1) the association between CD28 genetic polymorphism and cancer was evaluated; (2) the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) values, or sufficient data to calculate these, were reported; (3) genotyping and statistical methods were clearly described; and (4) the participants in the control group were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Studies were excluded if they were (1) non-case control studies; (2) duplicates of previous reports; (3) based on partial data; or (4) meta-analyses, reviews, or letters. Literature search and selection were performed by two authors (J.B. and H.L.) independently.

The following data were gathered from each study: first author׳s name, year of publication, country, ethnicity of study patients, genotyping method, cancer type, definition of the study patients (cases), source of the control group (controls), frequency of genotypes, sample size, and evidence of HWE in the controls.

ORs with 95% CI were used to assess the strength of the association between the CD28 rs3116496 polymorphism and cancer. The genetic models that were evaluated for pooled ORs were TT vs. TC, TC vs. CC, TT vs. CC, TT+TC vs. CC, TT vs. TC+CC, and T vs. C. Higgins׳ I2 statistic and the chi-square-based Q-test were used to assess heterogeneity among studies [51]. A P value<0.10 for the Q-test indicated significant heterogeneity, and at these instances, the random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) was used to calculate the pooled ORs; otherwise, the fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) was used [52–56]. In a fixed-effect model, for any observed effect

                        [52]. The statistical significance (P<0.05) of pooled ORs was determined by the Z-test. Publication bias in the literature was assessed by Egger׳s linear regression test, and visual inspection of asymmetry was performed in funnel plots [57]. If publication bias existed, p values examined by Egger׳s test would be resulted in less than 0.05 [57]. In order to correct publication bias, we employed ‘trim and fill’ method which was made to correct the funnel plot by imputing where the missing studies would be likely to be placed [58]. The correction for missing studies could lead to make relevant changes about the weighted mean effect, and thus, the influence of the publication bias for the statistical significance in the overall effects was evaluated [59,60].

All statistical tests were performed using the Review Manager (version 5.2; The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) and Comprehensive Meta Analysis (Biostat, Englewood, USA) software.

Of these, 615 were excluded by screening titles and keywords, 42 were excluded by reviewing the abstracts, and the remaining 15 were reviewed in detail based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. As a result, eight articles were ultimately selected for the meta-analysis of the CD28 rs3116496 polymorphism and cancer. The eight independent studies were based on three Asian and five European patient populations. The cancer types were breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, B cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. All DNA samples were extracted from blood, and various genotyping methods were used, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism, the multiplex PCR SNaPshot method, and allele-specific PCR. The genotype distributions among the control subjects in all the studies were in HWE. 
                        Table 1 lists the characteristics of each article.

Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger׳s test. Funnel plots in which the standard error of the log(OR) of each study was plotted against the associated standard error were visually inspected (
                        Fig. 2). Asymmetric plots were observed in some models; for instance, TT+TC vs. CC, TC vs. CC, and TT vs. CC, suggesting a possible publication bias. However, with the small number of studies included in the analysis, it was possible that the statistical power was too low to distinguish real asymmetry; therefore, Egger׳s test was also used.

The models TT+TC vs. CC and TC vs. CC showed asymmetry in the funnel plot with p values of 0.028 and 0.039 after calculation by Egger׳s test, respectively, while models TT vs. TC+CC, TT vs. TC, TT vs. CC, and T vs. C had no publication bias (
                        Table 2). After trim and fill procedure, we found that three studies have been missing and relevant changes in overall pooled ORs for both genetic models evaluated. For TT+TC vs. CC model, unadjusted pooled OR was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.57–1.23) and bias-adjusted pooled estimate was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.68–1.37). According to the TC vs. CC model, unadjusted pooled OR was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.66–1.46) and bias-adjusted pooled OR was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.79–1.64) (
                        Table 3). Through comparing calculated statistical significance by p value from the Z test with those unadjusted and bias-adjusted pooled ORs, we found that the publication bias of TT+TC vs. CC and TC vs. CC models did not affect statistical significance of overall effects. According to the results of TT+TC vs. CC model, unadjusted p value of pooled OR was 0.36 and the p value of bias-adjusted pooled OR was 0.85. In addition, unadjusted p value for TC vs. CC model was 0.91 and bias-adjusted p value was 0.50.

In addition, a heterogeneity test was performed to determine the similarity between the eight studies before they were combined for meta-analysis. There was no heterogeneity for models TT+TC vs. CC (P=0.81; I
                        2=0%), TT vs. CC (P=0.78; I
                        2=0%), and TC vs. CC (P=0.80; I
                        2=0%), as determined by the Cochrane Q test and Higgins׳ I2 statistic, while models TT vs. TC+CC (P=0.01; I
                        2=62%), TT vs. TC (P=0.01; I
                        2=61%), and T vs. C (P=0.01; I
                        2=60%) showed moderate heterogeneity.

In total, 2577 cancer cases and 3614 controls from eight case control studies were retrieved for analysis. Evidence of an association between the CD28 rs3116496 polymorphism and overall cancer incidence was observed for TT vs. TC+CC (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64–0.99; P=0.04) and T vs. C (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67–0.98; P=0.03), indicating that individuals who were T homozygous (TT) and heterozygous (TT+TC) carriers had 20% and 19% lower incidence of cancer, respectively, than carriers of the C allele (TC+CC) (
                        
                        Figs. 3 and 4). However, the other models showed no significant association between the CD28 polymorphism and cancer (Table 2). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, a lower cancer incidence was observed among Asians for TT vs. TC+CC (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.5–1.06; P=0.05) and T vs. C (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54–0.98; P=0.04), but not among Europeans (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting the possibility of ethnic differences in cancer. The results of the meta-analysis are summarized in Table 2. We then further analyzed the distribution information of rs3116496 in normal Asians (Han Chinese in Beijing, Chinese in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado, and Japanese in Tokyo) and Europeans (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry, and Tuscan) using Hapmap database and R (version 2.14.1). The result shows that there is a statistical difference in T allele frequency between Asians and Europeans in normal population [0.86 (Asians) versus 0.80 (Europeans); p<0.01 by 2-sample test for equality of proportion], indicating that the ethnic differences in cancer could be due to the result of distribution difference between two races in normal populations.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

A highly coordinated immune response is important for host defense against tumors. In particular, tight control of cellular immunity by CTLs and NK cells is a critical factor for antitumor immunity, and an increasing number of studies have reported an association between various cancers and polymorphisms in genes that control T cell and NK cell function.

CD28 is constitutively expressed on the T cell surface and provides costimulatory signals required for T cell activation. Interaction with the ligands B7-1 and B7-2 on APCs promotes the formation of an immunological synapse, thereby lowering the threshold of T cell receptor signaling required for effective cytokine production or proliferation. In accordance with the predominant function of CD28 as a positive regulator of T cells, studies have found possible associations between polymorphisms in the CD28 gene and incidence of various cancer types, including breast cancer, malignant melanoma, and cervical cancer. However, the data have been controversial, and a meta-analysis was undertaken in order to obtain more conclusive results.

Although 18 SNPs have been identified on the CD28 gene, only rs3116496 has been widely studied, with most other SNPs being examined by fewer than two studies. Meta-analysis of CD28 rs3116496 showed a reduced incidence of cancer associated with the T allele (TT homozygotes and T allele carriers). Furthermore, in a subgroup analysis by ethnicity, lower cancer incidence was seen for Asians, but not Europeans. When we further analyzed the distribution information of rs3116496 in normal Asians and Europeans, we found that T allele frequency was higher in Asians in normal population. This result indicates that distribution difference between two races results in the difference between Asians and European in cancer. However, the decrease in cancer in Asians would not solely be attributed to higher T allele frequency, since there are other factors affecting cancer. Similar ethnic differences have been observed in other meta-analyses and may result from interactions between genetic and environmental or cultural factors [6,61,62]. Given the small number of studies and sample sizes included in this analysis, a large-scale study with a broader representation of ethnicities is required to assess the effect of ethnic differences in this polymorphism on cancer.

Some additional limitations in the current analysis need to be addressed. First, the analysis comprised only published studies; thus, the exclusion of unpublished negative or non-significant findings would lead to an inevitable bias in the results. Second, the studies were restricted to Asian and European populations, thereby limiting the applicability of the findings to the general population, especially given the ethnic differences that were suggested by the present results. In addition, a stratified analysis—specifically, a subgroup analysis by cancer type—could not be performed, due to an insufficient number of studies, and the lack of relevant information such as age, gender, and drinking and smoking habits in the original articles. Finally, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions were not taken into account in this analysis.

Despite these limitations, this meta-analysis suggests that the CD28 polymorphism contributes to genetic susceptibility to multiple cancers. Further studies examining a larger and more diverse patient population are required to address the issue of ethnic differences in cancer susceptibility, as well as the association between the CD28 polymorphism and specific types of cancer.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

As a costimulatory molecule, CD28 provides co-stimulatory signals required for T cell activation and proliferation. Given the predominant function of CD28 as a T cell positive regulator, studies have shown that polymorphisms in CD28 gene may contribute to cancer, but the results are conflicting. In this meta-analysis, we found that individuals who carried T allele (TT homozygotes and TT+TC heterozygotes) had a decreased incidence of cancer compared with those who carried C allele. Our findings are important, because we resolve the importance of CD28 polymorphism in cancer.
