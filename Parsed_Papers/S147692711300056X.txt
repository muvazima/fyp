                  Reptin functions in a wide range of biological processes including chromatin remodelling, nucleolar organization and transcriptional regulation of WNT signalling. As β-catenin dependent transcriptional repression and activation events involve binding of Reptin and histone deacetylase 1 to APPL endocytic proteins, this complex has become an important target to identify molecules governing endocytic processes and WNT signalling. Here, we describe the structural basis of APPL binding to Reptin to explore their mode of binding in context with APPL1/APPL2 dimerization. There is an evidence that both PH and BAR domains of APPL proteins exhibit alternately conserved regions involved in hetero-dimerization process and our in-silico data also corroborate this fact. Moreover, APPL2PH domain binds to the BAR domain region encompassing a nuclear localization signal. We conclude that APPLPH binding to BAR domain and Reptin is mutually exclusive which regulates the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Reptin. Furthermore, Reptin is unable to bind with membrane-associated APPL proteins. These observations were further expanded by experimental approaches where we identified a novel point mutation D316N lying in the APPL1PH domain which resulted in a significantly reduced binding with Reptin. By luciferase assays, we observed that overexpression of APPL1D316N and APPL1WT stimulated β-catenin/TCF dependent transcriptional activity in a similar manner which suggested that binding of Reptin to APPL1 is not necessary for β-catenin dependent target gene expression. Overall, our data attempt to highlight a comparative role of APPL proteins in controlling β-catenin dependent transcription mechanism which may improve our understanding of gene regulation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

APPL (Adaptor protein containing PH domain, PTB domain, and Leucine zipper motif) proteins are multifunctional adaptors and effectors of small GTPase Rab5 (Miaczynska et al., 2004). Being capable of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, these proteins act as novel activators of β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription (Jonsson et al., 2004). APPL proteins directly interact with Reptin via PH domain and overexpression of either APPL1 or APPL2 protein reduces Reptin-mediated transcriptional repression which correlates with the reduced amounts of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and β-catenin associated with Reptin. Thus APPL proteins exert their stimulatory effects on β-catenin/TCF dependent transcription by reducing the activity of a Reptin-containing repressive complex (Rashid et al., 2009). Reptin belongs to the AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) family and required for the structural integrity and catalytic activity of several chromatin remodelling complexes (Torreira et al., 2008). This protein has a general role in the assembly and regulation of several protein complexes like telomerase (Boulon et al., 2008) and those which are involved in small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein assembly (Gallant, 2007). Moreover, it is involved in diverse cellular processes including DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, protein folding, growth regulation, transcriptional regulation, histone H2A/H4 acetylation and control of gene expression (Ikura et al., 2000; Blanc et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2006; Jha et al., 2008; Huber et al., 2008).

Recently, overexpression of Reptin (RuvBL2, TIP49b, and TIP48) has been reported in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Rousseau et al., 2007). In another study, microarray data analysis revealed a deregulated expression of this protein in bladder cancer and melanoma (Blanc et al., 2005). Intriguingly, a potential role of this protein in reverting cancer phenotype has also been reported, where its reduced expression resulted in decrease of tumour cell growth due to a high rate of apoptosis in vitro (Carter, 1986). Thus this protein may qualify as a potential therapeutic target for oncologists.

To gain a deep insight into the functional implication of APPL proteins and Reptin binding, we performed a detailed in silico analysis using the knowledge of APPL1/2 heterodimerization and inferred that binding of APPLPH to BAR domain and Reptin is mutually exclusive which may facilitate Reptin in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Taken together our data provides new insights into the distinctive characterization of APPL-β-catenin-Reptin-HDACs ternary complex in terms of target gene regulation and transcriptional mechanisms which would provide the basis for novel therapeutic approaches.

In the absence of a well-defined or experimentally determined structure, comparative modelling is one of the most accurate computational approaches to generate reliable tertiary protein structure through sequence information (Tramontano, 1998). Primary sequence of Reptin (463 AA) was retrieved through Ensembl genome browser (ID: ENSP00000473127) and subjected to similarity search against PDB database (www.pdb.org) (Bernstein et al., 1977). Pontin (PDB ID: 2C9O, resolution: 2.20Å) (Matias et al., 2006), being a close homolog of Reptin was selected as the best template for homology modelling (Lambert et al., 2002). Missing residues were incorporated by de novo prediction methods (http://robetta.bakerlab.org/
                        ) (Kim et al., 2004). The RMSD between the minimized target and template protein structures was found to be 1.4Å.

3D structures of APPL1BAR-PH domain and APPL2BAR-PH domains were retrieved from PDB database with PDB IDs: 2Q13 and 4H8S, respectively. Missing residues were modelled by homology modelling using Modeller 9.10 (Eswar et al., 2006). For mutated structure, Asp316 was replaced by Asn followed by remodelling with calculated RMSD value of 0.52Å between wild type and mutated APPL1PH. In this study, normal and mutated PH domains were designated as PHWT and PHD316N, respectively. Remodelled structure of Reptin and PH were validated using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), ERRAT (Colovos and Yeates, 1993), VERIFY-3D (Eisenberg et al., 1997), and WHAT-IF tools (Vriend and Graph, 1990) (Table S1 and Figs. S1 and S2). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values derived from the C-alpha/backbone of the predicted models and corresponding templates were calculated by superimposing the respective structures. Furthermore, PROSA (Sippl, 1993; Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007) test was applied to the final models to check energy criteria against the potential of mean force derived from a large set of known protein structures.

In step 2 sequence–structure alignments of BAR-PH domains of APPL1 and APPL2 were carried out for their comparative analysis to assess the conservation of significant structural folds across BAR-PH domain family.

Molecular docking assays for individual PH domains (APPL1-PHWT and APPL1-PHD316N and APPL2-PH) against Reptin were carried out using AutoDock4.0 tool (Morris et al., 2009) on OpenSUSE 11.2 containing Intel(R) Core (TM) i5-2300 CPU system. Removal of water molecules and addition of solvation parameters were performed using the corresponding modules in AutoDock tools. To prepare the receptor and ligand, polar hydrogens were added and Kollman united atom partial charges were assigned. The empirical free energy function and Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) were applied with the following parameters: population of 50 randomly placed individuals, a maximum number of 27,000 generations, a mutation rate of 0.02, a crossover rate of 0.80, and number of energy evaluations were 2.5×106. 100 independent docking runs were carried out for each ligand with a grid spacing of 0.675Å. AutoDock uses pre-computed affinity grid maps for each atom type to score the conformations of the ligand found during the genetic algorithm.

Subsequently, results were clustered according to the RMSD criterion and the best docked conformations of ligands were selected on the basis of binding free energy values to evaluate the Reptin-APPL1-PHWT, Reptin-APPL1-PHD316N and Reptin-APPL2-PHWT bindings. The ranked docked complexes were isolated from the pool of docking solutions and were subjected to manual editing. Individual chain IDs were assigned to the candidate proteins of respective complexes. Reptin-APPL1-PHWT, Reptin-APPL1-PHD316N and Reptin-APPL2-PHWT complexes were then analyzed in parallel to monitor the differences in binding by PyMol (Warren, 2002) and Chimaera 1.5.2 (Pettersen et al., 2004). The surface residues of all the complexes were investigated by InterproSurf (Negi et al., 2007). Finally, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions were monitored by Dimplot (Wallace et al., 1995). Furthermore, hydrophobic and electrostatic maps were generated by AutoDock 4.0 (Morris et al., 2009).

By site directed mutagenesis (Carter, 1986), Aspartic acid at 316 position of APPL1 was substituted by Asparagine, referred as APPL1-PHD316N. N-terminal fragments for both normal and mutated GST (Glutathione S-transferase)tagged APPL1 (1–428 AA) proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). GST tag consists of 220 amino acid residues which helps in solubility and purification of tagged protein. In brief, Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.5mM was used to induce the expression. The purified GST-APPL1 proteins bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated overnight at 4°C with lysates of HA-Reptin transfected HEK293 cells. After washing with 150mM NaCl, 10mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5mM EDTA, 5mM dithiothreitol and 0.1% Triton X-100, the beads were collected and tested for the bound proteins by immunoblotting with anti-HA-specific antibodies.


                        In vitro translation reactions were carried out in a TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate, using the Transcend non-radioactive translation detection system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) pull-down was performed as described. Briefly, 2–5μg of purified His6-Reptin or His6-β-catenin proteins were incubated with 4μl in vitro translated proteins including APPL1-PHWT, APPL1-PHD316N, myc-APPL1- PHWT and myc-APPL1-PHD316N, plasmids in 300μl of binding buffer 2 (20mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20mM imidazole, 120mM potassium acetate, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 1h at 4°C. Beads were washed three times, and bound proteins were eluted by Laemmli sample buffer. Products were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with specific antibodies. The following antibodies were used: anti-Reptin (Abcam), anti HDAC1 (Abcam), anti- β-catenin (BD Bioscience), anti-APPL (Abcam).

Luciferase assays were performed in 50% confluent HEK293 cells transiently transfected with SuperFOPflash (0.1μg), SuperTOPflash reporter (0.1μg), Renilla luciferase (0.1μg), β-catenin (0.3μg), Reptin (0.5μg), APPL1-PHWT and APPL1-PHD316N (0.5μg and 1μg) plasmids as indicated. Transfections of plasmids were made using Lipofectamaine2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). In all assays, amounts of DNA transfected were kept constant by empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid. Values are mean ±S.D. from three independent transfections performed in parallel and are representative of three experiments. Data are normalized to the luciferase activity stimulated by β-catenin alone, which was arbitrarily set to 1 unit of relative activity. After 48h, the transfected cells were lysed and the lysates were subjected to luciferase activity assay.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Primary sequence alignment and structural superimpositions of APPL1BAR-PH and APPL2BAR-PH domains were carried out to explore the sequence to structural dynamics. Overall sequence similarity between APPL1BAR-PH and APPL2BAR-PH is 55% (Fig. 1a). At structure level, we monitored several unique features in APPLBAR domain regions implicated in binding with PH domain. For example, Two Bar domain regions (15–20 AA) and (149–156 AA) (yellow highlighted) have significant interaction with two PH domain regions (312–316 AA) and (334–342 AA) indicated by green shade and are substantially conserved (Fig. 1a) (Zhu et al., 2007; King et al., 2012). More interestingly, this region also encompasses a nuclear localization signal (NLS) “PKKKENE” only sensitive to APPL2 protein (Fig. 1a).

Subsequent 3D structural alignment of APPL1BAR and APPL2BAR domains revealed an RMSD score of 1.23Å which suggests a high similarity in BAR domains (Fig. 1b). Both BAR domains consist of four α-helices designated as α1, α2, α3 and α4, while connecting loops were labelled after the preceding α-helix. There is a slight deviation in L2 loop region, which contains a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Fig. 1b-I and II). Previously, this loop region has been reported to mediate interaction with PH domain region located between β3 and β4 (Zhu et al., 2007). Generally, PH domains of APPL1 and APPL2 exhibit less conservation specifically at the loop regions with an overall RMSD value of 1.28Å (Fig. 1c). The core structure of APPL1PH domain consists of seven β-sheets (β1–β7) and a C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 1c-I), while APPL2PH domain comprises of five β-sheets (β1-β5) and a C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 1c-II). The connecting loops were named after the preceding β-strands.

Signal generated in response to extracellular stimuli at the plasma membrane are transmitted to the nucleus through cytoplasmic transduction cascades. APPL1 and APPL2 are essential for cell proliferation and its function as both proteins target to the cell membranes via Rab5 binding (Miaczynska et al., 2004; King et al., 2012). It has been reported that APPL1BAR-PH domains function in dimer form. APPL1BAR-PH and APPL2BAR-PH domains interact in vivo and transduce the signal either in the form of homotypic or heterotypic manner (Fig. 2
                        ), thereby interacting with other proteins of signal cascade (Chial et al., 2010). BAR domains of APPL proteins adopt a typical crescent shape in dimerization form with the PH domains located at the distal end of dimer (Fig. 2). In case of APPL1, the two regions of BAR domain (15–21, 149–156 AA) are involved in interaction with the 312–316 AA and 334–342 AA regions of PH domain, respectively (Zhu et al., 2007). Likewise nearly the same regions of APPL2BAR domain (16–21, 148–153 AA) are involved in interaction with evolutionary conserved PH domain regions (312–316, 334–339 AA) (King et al., 2012) as indicated in Fig. 2.

In order to investigate how APPL proteins bind with Reptin and exert their stimulatory effects on β-catenin/TCF dependent transcription by reducing the activity of a Reptin-containing repressive complex (Torreira et al., 2008), we performed a comparative analysis of APPL1PH and APPL2PH domains for binding with Reptin. Our docking results demonstrated that almost same regions of Reptin (lying between α1, β5, β6, β7, α22 and α23) are involved in binding with APPL1PH and APPL2PH domains (Fig. 3a and b). However, in case of APPL1PH domain, the diversity of interacting residues encompassing interactions with Reptin was higher as compared to APPL2PH domain by higher number of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction (Fig. 3a and b). In total, five hydrogen bonds were present in Reptin-APPL1PH binding. The amino acid residues of Reptin including Pro11, Ala198, Leu411, and Arg414 have hydrophobic interaction with Phe301, Phe303, Met310, Gln312, Asp324 residues of APPL1PH domain. Moreover, Lys9, Glu12 and Lys415 residues of Reptin were involved in hydrogen bonding with Gly306, Asp326, Asn308, Ala313 and Arg314 of APPL1PH domain, respectively (Table 1
                        ). In case of Reptin-APPL2PH, we observed that Lys9, Pro11, Pro150, Val158, Met178, Asp196, Lys197, Ala198, Thr199, Arg414 and Thr419 residues of Reptin were involved in hydrophobic interaction with Asn288, Glu298, Leu300, Thr304, Gln305, Gly306, Pro313, Ala318, Leu321, Ile322, Pro347, Asn348, and Ile377 residues of APPL2PH domain. However, only two hydrogen bonds were present among Ser156 and Lys417 residues of Reptin with Gln279 and Leu286 residues of APPL2PH domain, respectively (Table 1).

By site directed mutagenesis, we revealed a novel point mutation (D316N) in APPL1PH domain. D316 residue is evolutionary conserved among PH domains of multiple species which further divulge its structural and functional importance (Fig. S3). To gain insight into the probable binding conformations of APPL1PH domain with Reptin and to monitor the effect of D316N mutation on the binding of PH domain to Reptin, we isolated recombinant proteins. The results of pull-down and in vitro binding assays established that Reptin binding to APPL1-PHWT was higher as compared to the PHD316N (Fig. 4a). However, binding of HDAC1 was not affected by D316N mutation in GST-fused APPL1-N terminus (Fig. 4a). Similarly, full length APPL1 was specifically retained on Reptin-containing Ni2+-NTA beads, whereas no unspecific binding was detected to empty beads (Fig. 4b). These data demonstrated that PHD316N domain exhibited a reduced binding with Reptin as compared to PHWT.

To further validate our observation, we performed luciferase assays using full-length APPL1 clones (APPL1-PHWT and APPL1-PHD316N) in β-catenin activated HEK293 cells. In agreement with our previous findings, overexpression of both APPL1-PHWT and APPL1- PHD316N constructs resulted in upregulation of β-catenin dependent reporter activity (Fig. 4c).

In order to further refine our experimental results, we have modelled APPL1-PHD316N and performed molecular docking studies. Surprisingly we obtained consistent results with in vitro experimental investigations and established that Reptin-APPL1-PHWT binding is reasonably strong involving higher hydrophobic interactions and five hydrogen bonds (Table 1) compared to Reptin-APPL1-PHD316N which has two hydrogen bonds and few hydrophobic interactions (Fig. S4). In Reptin-APPL1- PHD316N complex, Lys9, Pro150, Ser156, Val158, Arg414 and Lys417 of Reptin were having hydrophobic interactions with Phe301, Phe303, Arg338, Glu358, Gln364 and Cys368 residues of APPL1-PH domain. Moreover, Asp15 and Thr176 residues of Reptin were involved in hydrogen bonding with Arg314 and Lys367 of PHD316N domain, respectively.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Here we report the structural basis of APPL and Reptin binding by exploring their mode of interaction and characterizing the effect of APPL1/2 heterodimerization in Reptin binding. To monitor the differences of APPL specific BAR-PH dimer form at structural level, we superimposed these domains derived from APPL1 and APPL2 (Fig. 1). In contrast to the first three α-helices of BAR domain which superposed well, the fourth α-helix did not show conservation at structural level. Generally, this α-helix of BAR domain is located at the convex side and extends away from the first three α-helices. It has been reported previously that this α-helix has no contribution in maintaining the structural organization of concave inner face (Zhu et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007). Moreover, APPL1PH domain directly connects with the L2 loop (between α2 and α3) and α1 helix (15–20 AA) of BAR domain via its L3 (312-316 AA) and L5 (334–342 AA) regions, respectively and attains a stable conformation in heterodimeric form (Zhu et al., 2007). In case of APPL2, two regions of BAR domain including 16–21 AA (α1) and 148–153 AA (L2) interact with 312–316 and 334–339 amino acid residues of PH domain, respectively (King et al., 2012). These connecting regions of BAR and PH domains are highly conserved at sequence level (Fig. 1). Notably, we observed that binding of Reptin to PH domain occurs at similar regions which are implicated in interactions with BAR domain. Accordingly, Gly306, Asn308, Ala313, Arg314 and Asp326 residues of APPL1PH domain formed hydrogen bonds with Reptin, while Phe301, Phe303, Met310, Gln312, Asp324 residues of APPL1PH monomer were found to be involved in hydrophobic interactions. Similar observation was noticed in case of APPL2PH domain which suggests that Reptin binding to PH domain perturbs the BAR-PH dimerization process. Further support of the notion that binding of PH domain to Reptin and BAR domain in APPL1/2 dimer form occurs at the same sites comes through the analysis of APPL1-PHD316N which exhibited a reduced binding with Reptin. Interestingly, APPL1-PHD316 residue is involved in interaction with BAR domain (Zhu et al., 2007); however, in case of APPL2, this residue is replaced by Alanine which may be associated with interaction specificities. This fact also signifies that Reptin is unable to bind with the membrane-associated APPL proteins which require heterodimerization of BAR and PH domains.

In homodimeric form, both BAR and PH domains of APPL1 are involved in Rab5 binding; where BAR domain of one monomer and PH domain of the other monomer interact with GTP-bound Rab5 located at each end of the curved BAR-PH dimer (Zhu et al., 2007). Despite the fact that GTP-Rab5 interacts with both APPL1 and APPL2 (Miaczynska et al., 2004), a direct association of GTP-Rab5 with APPL1 homodimers, APPL2 homodimers or APPL1/2 heterodimers has not been reported. Clearly, dimerization process of BAR domain and phosphoinositide binding regulates the dynamic association of APPL proteins to the cell membrane. Previously, both APPL1 and APPL2 minimal BAR domains lacking the fourth α-helix have been reported to associate with curved cell membranes (Chial et al., 2008), which potentiates that APPL minimal BAR domains are sufficient to mediate APPL-APPL interactions (Chial et al., 2008). Moreover, in vivo binding assays of APPL1 or APPL2 minimal BAR domain monomers to the cell membranes further describe the implication of Rab5 dependent homodimerization and heterodimerization processes (Chial et al., 2010). However, Reptin's enrichment on the endosomal membranes has not been detected in the cells overexpressing Rab5Q79L constitutively active mutant (Rashid et al., 2009), which delineates the absence of Reptin and APPL1 interaction at cell membrane. Consistently, APPL1-PHD316A substitution resulted in significant reduction of APPL1 binding to Rab21 (Zhu et al., 2007) which specifies the functional contribution of D316 residue in binding. In our luciferase assays, APPL1-PHD316N had shown a similar stimulation pattern of β-catenin/TCF dependent reporter activity (Fig. 4) to that of normal which indicated that binding of Reptin to APPL1 is not required for β-catenin target gene expression. This observation further implies that Reptin binding to APPL1 and APPL2 may depend on their localization due to the presence of nuclear localization signal (151PKKKENE157) in the L2 loop (interacting region with PH domain) of APPL2BAR domain (King et al., 2012) and that BAR-PH dimerization prevents APPL2 nuclear localization. Thus based on the common binding sites of APPL2PH domain to Reptin and BAR domain, we speculate that Reptin binding to APPL2PH domain prevents its association with BAR domain and exposes the corresponding NLS-containing region which may facilitate the Reptin in nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. It is possible that both BAR and PH domains contribute in binding of APPL proteins to β-catenin and alteration of Reptin binding to APPL1 is not sufficient to disturb the repressive function of Reptin. Taken together, elucidation of D316N point mutation in mediating BAR-PH dimerization needs more attention to explore the β-catenin/TCF dependent gene regulation.
