               Abstract
               
                  Sleep apnoea is a very common sleep disorder which is able to cause symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, irritability and poor concentration. This paper presents a combinational feature extraction approach based on some nonlinear features extracted from Electro Cardio Graph (ECG) Reconstructed Phase Space (RPS) and usually used frequency domain features for detection of sleep apnoea. Here 6 nonlinear features extracted from ECG RPS are combined with 3 frequency based features to reconstruct final feature set. The nonlinear features consist of Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Correlation Dimensions (CD), 3 Large Lyapunov Exponents (LLEs) and Spectral Entropy (SE). The final proposed feature set show about 94.8% accuracy over the Physionet sleep apnoea dataset using a kernel based SVM classifier. This research also proves that using non-linear analysis to detect sleep apnoea can potentially improve the classification accuracy of apnoea detection system.
