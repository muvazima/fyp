                  The objective of this study was to examine the effects of different types of insoles on postural stability in older adults. Four types of commercially available insoles were selected including the cupped insoles, textured insoles, rigid insoles, and soft insoles. The experiment included a static stance session and a walking session. In the static stance session, the participants stood upright on a force platform as still as possible, with feet together, arms by the side and looking straight ahead. The mean velocity of center-of-pressure time series obtained from the force platform was used to assess static postural stability. In the walking session, the participants walked on a treadmill at their self-selected comfortable speed for 4.5 min in each insole condition. Dynamic postural stability was assessed using the margin of stability. It was found that static postural stability was not affected by insoles, but cupped insoles improved dynamic postural stability, and rigid insole was associated with better dynamic postural stability compared to soft insoles. These findings can aid in better understanding the insole design features associated with improved postural stability in older adults.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Maintaining postural stability is a fundamental functional ability of humans to manage activities of daily living. Aging is often associated with decreased postural stability (Du Pasquier et al., 2003) that has adverse effects on older adults' function and quality of life. In fact, postural instability has been recognized a major risk factor for frequent falls among older people (Rubenstein, 2006). Maintenance of postural stability depends on the integration of musculoskletal, neural, kinesthetic, cognitive, motor control, and diverse afferent (sensory) inputs. The somatosensory information from afferent receptors from the skin, joints, muscles, and tendons is critical to maintaining postural stability (Manchester et al., 1989). Meyer et al. (2004) used intradermal injections of local anesthetic into the entire weight-bearing surface of the foot soles to attenuate the somatosensory feedback from the plantar cutaneous surface of the feet, and found that such attenuation was associated with decreased postural stability. Thus, interventions have been designed to improve postural stability by enhancing the somatosensory feedback (Dickstein et al., 2001; Qu, 2010; Singh et al., 2009).

Insole interventions were suggested able to alter somatosensory information from plantar cutaneous receptors (Maki et al., 1999). In addition, insole interventions also play a role in the control of postures by providing mechanical support to the body (Perry et al., 2007). Therefore, many recent studies have examined the effects of insole interventions on postural stability (Iglesias et al., 2012; Simeonov et al., 2011). Based on the theory of stochastic resonance, vibrating insoles have been proposed as an intervention for improving postural stability (Galica et al., 2009; Priplata et al., 2003; Simeonov et al., 2011). Priplata et al. (2003), for example, found that wearing vibrating insoles can lead to a reduction of standing postural sway. More recently, Galica et al. (2009) have reported that vibrating insoles could reduce gait variability and such reductions were similar between older recurrent fallers and older non-fallers. Limitations of using vibrating insoles as an intervention for improving postural stability are that it is expensive and requires an external power supply to activate vibration. Thus, vibrating insoles may not be a feasible solution to improving postural stability in practice.

Some studies investigated the effects of textured insoles on postural stability. It was generally reported that textured insoles can increase standing postural stability of both younger and older people in the eye-closed condition (Corbin et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2012). However, in the eye-open condition, textured insoles made no differences (Corbin et al., 2007). Postural stability was also found to be affected by insole material hardness (Iglesias et al., 2012). Iglesias et al. (2012) suggested that more rigid insoles lead to greater postural stability with the underlying mechanism that more rigid insoles are more likely to place the foot in a more neutral position while softer insoles tend to better accommodate foot posture. A common limitation with the current research on textured insoles and insole material hardness is that postural stability was mainly assessed during static stance. Most activities of daily living are dynamic in nature and the mechanisms used to maintain static stability are quite different from those used to maintain dynamic stability (Hyun and Dingwell, 2006). An investigation on the textured insoles effects during dynamic activities was done by Hatton et al. (2012) who reported that wearing textured insoles did not affect gait stability parameters.

Besides the above-mentioned studies, Perry et al. (2008) compared a balance-enhancing insole and a conventional insole in terms of their effects on lateral stability during walking on a simulated uneven terrain. Different from the conventional insole, the balance-enhancing insole had a raised ridge around the perimeter. Perry et al. (2008) found that the balance-enhancing insole improved lateral gait stability over the uneven ground. de Castro et al. (2014) studied the effects of two pressure relief insoles during gait. They found that the insole with corkgel in the rearfoot and forefoot could relieved plantar pressure peaks, while the insole with poron foam in the great toe and lateral forefoot lowered ground reaction forces. de Castro et al. (2014) did not examine how these pressure relief insoles affect postural stability during gait.

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of four different types of insoles on postural stability in older adults. Postural stability was assessed in both static and dynamic conditions. Four types of commercially available insoles were selected including cupped insoles, textured insoles, rigid insoles and soft insoles. We hypothesized that cupped insoles, textured insoles and rigid insoles would be associated with greater postural stability compared to soft insoles, because of the fact that softer standing surface decreases somatosensory feedback (Patel et al., 2011).

@&#METHODS@&#

Thirteen healthy older adults including five males and eight females were recruited (age: 69.2 ± 7.2 years; height: 160.5 ± 6.8 cm; weight: 60.0 ± 6.9 kg). They were all above 60 years old, living independently in their own home, able to walk without the assistance of another person, and having no medical conditions. All participants provided written informed consent which was approved by the local ethical committee.

Four types of commercially-available insoles were examined in the present study (Fig. 1
                        ). These insoles were designed and manufactured by Daiso Japan. The cupped insole is made from polyester and urethane sponge with the heel edge raised by approximately 15 mm (Fig. 1a). The textured insole is made from polyester and EVA (Fig. 1b) and has convex circular patterning with center-to-center distances of approximately 10 mm. The rigid insole and soft insole both have a complete flat surface (Figs. 1c and d). The rigid insole is made from polyurethane and EVA, and the material of the soft insole is slow rebound foam sponge. The insoles with different sizes were available to fit different foot sizes.

At the beginning of the experiment, the participants were required to change into tight-fitting suit (products of FBT, Thailand) and to wear standard walking shoes (products of Checker, Taiwan) and socks (80% combed cotton+20% nylon elastane, products of Hush Puppies, Michigan). The whole experiment was divided into two sessions: static stance session and walking session. The sequence of these two sessions was counterbalanced among the participants. In each session, the four different types of insoles were presented to the participants in a random order. Before testing each type of insoles, the participants were given the chance to wear the insoles and casually walk around in the lab for at least 10 min.

Each static stance trial lasted 80 s, in which the participants were instructed to stand upright on a force platform (AMTI OR6-7, Watertown, MA, USA) as still as possible, with feet together, arms by the side and looking straight ahead. Three static stance trials were performed by the participants in each insole condition. Therefore, each participant performed 12 trials in total in the static stance session. Tri-axial ground reaction forces and moments were sampled at 1000 Hz and used to derive center-of-pressure (COP) time series. A low-pass filter (Butterworth, second order) was used to remove the noise from the force platform signals with the cut-off frequency set at 5 Hz which is consistent with earlier approaches (Prieto et al., 1996). Note that static postural stability was examined in an eye-open condition in the present study. This is because most of activities of daily living are performed with eyes open.

In the walking session, a total of 26 reflective markers were placed bilaterally over selected anatomical landmarks of the body (Fig. 2
                        ). This marker placement scheme can help model the body as a 12-segment rigid body model including the head, trunk, upper arms, lower arms, thighs, shanks, and feet. The participants were asked to look straight ahead and walk on a medical treadmill (Biodex RTM 600, Shirley, NY, USA) at their self-selected comfortable speed for 4.5 min in each insole condition. An eight-camera motion capture system (Motion Analysis Eagle System, CA, USA) was used to collect the body kinematic data. The sampling rate was 100 Hz, and the raw data from the motion capture system were filtered using a second order Butterworth filter with the cut-off frequency at 6 Hz.

COP-based measures have been commonly used to assess postural stability during static stance. Among the COP-based measures, mean velocity (MV) has been found to be the most reliable (Lin et al., 2008). Thus in the present study, the MVs of the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) COP time series (Eq. (1)) were selected as the dependent measures for analysis. The calculation of AP MV and ML MV are given below (Prieto et al., 1996):

The initial 10 s and last 20 s were removed when calculating AP MV and ML MV to avoid initial transients and termination anticipation effects, respectively. Smaller AP MV and ML MV indicate greater static postural stability in the AP and ML directions, respectively.

Postural stability during walking was assessed using the margin of stability (MOS), which is defined by the distance from the vertical projection of the extrapolated center of mass (XCOM) to the base of support (BOS) boundary (Hof et al., 2005). The XCOM is calculated as follows:

                        where COM represents the whole-body center-of-mass, VEL_COM is the velocity of the COM, l is the equivalent pendulum length which was calculated as the distance between the COM and the striking heel at the moment of heel strike (Young et al., 2012), and G = 9.81 m/s2 is the acceleration due to gravity. The COM displacement was computed as the weighted sum of each body segment's center-of-mass from the 12-segement model (Fig. 2). The parameters for estimating body segments' center-of-mass locations were provided by der Leva (1996). The COM velocity was determined as the derivative of the COM displacement using the finite difference method. MOS were determined using the approach proposed by Young et al. (2012). In particular, AP MOS were the AP distance between the XCOM and the toe marker of the leading foot, and ML MOS were the lateral distance between the XCOM and the heel marker of the leading foot. After establishing a steady-gait pattern, three random collections of 60 steps in each trial were selected. MOS was calculated at heel strike of every step, and the mean of MOS in each collection of 60 steps was used as the dependent measure. Larger AP MOS and ML MOS indicate greater dynamic postural stability in the AP and ML directions, respectively.

Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in the dependent measures among the four insole conditions. If any significant difference was found by ANOVA, post hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted using the Tukey's HSD criterion. Level of significance was set at 0.05.

@&#RESULTS@&#

No significant differences in AP MV (p-value = 0.158), ML MV (p-value = 0.893), ML MOS (p-value = 0.662) were found among different insole conditions (Fig. 3
                     a, Figs. 3b, and Fig. 3d). Only AP MOS was significantly affected when wearing different types of insoles (p-value = 0.042) (Fig. 3c). In particular, results from the post hoc pairwise comparisons showed that AP MOS was significantly larger in the cupped insole condition than those in the other insole conditions (p-values < 0.001). The rigid insole condition was also found to be associated with larger AP MOS when compared to the soft insole condition (p-value = 0.035).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In the present study, we aimed to determine whether insole interventions could be a practical solution to improving postural stability. In particular, four different types of insoles were examined in terms of their effects on postural stability. These insoles were all commercially available and have been popularly worn by people. Therefore, unlike previous insole interventions (Galica et al., 2009; Perry et al., 2008), user acceptance of the selected insoles should be high. In addition, the selected insoles are cost-effective and easy-to-implement which makes it feasible to apply the findings obtained from this study into practice.

The current study showed that the cupped insoles influenced postural stability during walking in a manner that increased MOS in the AP direction (Fig. 3c). As larger MOS indicates greater dynamic postural stability, this result suggests that the cupped insoles can improve dynamic postural stability in the AP direction. Different from other insoles, the cupped insoles have raised edge around the heel (Fig. 1a). This design feature may be the cause of greater postural stability associated with the cupped insoles, since the raised edge is able to enhance somatosensory feedback through cutaneous receptors near the heel especially when the COM approaches the posterior BOS limits (Perry et al., 2008). Improved postural stability with the cupped insoles was only found in the AP direction. This may be due to that the heel is at the posterior side of the foot, and the stimulated cutaneous receptors at the posterior side of the foot mainly feedback body posture information in the AP direction. From a mechanical perspective, the raised edge around the heel could provide external forces in the anterior direction to the body. These anterior forces would contribute to moving the COM back to its stable position when the COM approaches the posterior BOS limits.

Unlike dynamic postural stability, the cupped insoles appeared not to affect static postural stability. This supports the argument that the mechanisms used to maintain static postural stability are different from those used to maintain dynamic stability, and necessitates the need to study both static and dynamic activities when assessing postural stability. Previous insole studies mainly focused on static postural stability (Corbin et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2012), but most activities of daily living are dynamic in nature. In the present study, we assessed both static and dynamic postural stability. Therefore, findings obtained from here can be better generalized into practical applications.

In our work, textured insoles were found to make no differences in postural stability in comparison to other insole conditions. This finding is consistent with previous studies reporting that postural stability was not affected by textured insoles in the eye-open condition (Corbin et al., 2007; Hatton et al., 2009). However, in the eye-closed condition, previous studies found that textured insoles were able to improve static postural stability (Qiu et al., 2012). The discrepancy in the effects of textured insoles between the eye-open and eye-closed conditions highlights that somatosensory feedback plays a more important role in the maintenance of postural stability when the visual input is deprived.

We found that rigid insoles were associated with larger AP MOS compared to soft insoles (Fig. 3c), suggesting that more rigid insoles may lead to greater dynamic postural stability in the AP direction. This finding is consistent with earlier work (Iglesias et al., 2012), and can be explained by three facts. First, softer insoles might reduce the reliability of the cutaneous sensations received at the soles of the feet (Patel et al., 2011). Second, compared to more rigid insoles, softer insoles provide less mechanical support to generate reactive forces and required more muscle activity to counteract postural perturbations during walking (Iglesias et al., 2012; Perry et al., 2007), which make the maintenance of postural stability more difficult especially for older adults. Third, more rigid insoles are more likely to place the foot in a more neutral position and softer insoles tend to better accommodate foot posture, while it was reported that a more neutral foot position was associated with greater postural stability by improving muscular contributions to ankle joint stability (Hertel et al., 2001; Ochsendorf et al., 2000).

A limitation of the present study was that only the short-term effects of the selected insoles on postural stability were examined. Since people may adapt to these insoles over time, a longitudinal study should be conducted to investigate how the insoles affect postural stability over long term in the future. According to Perry et al. (2008), adaptation effects on postural stability were not significant when wearing a passive balance enhancing insole for 12 weeks. Therefore, we may expect that the long-term effects would be similar as the short-term effects we obtained from the present study. Another limitation is that dynamic postural stability was studied only in the activity of walking while postural control mechanisms could be different across various activities. However, since walking is one of the most common activities of daily living and up to 70% of falls in older adults occur during walking (Cali and Kiel, 1995; Norton et al., 1997), the findings obtained from the present study can be well generalized into real-life situations.

In conclusion, though static postural stability was not affected by the selected insoles, cupped insoles were found to improve dynamic postural stability, and rigid insole was associated with better dynamic postural stability compared to soft insoles. Thus, our initial hypothesis was partly supported by this research. The findings obtained here can aid in better understanding the insole design features associated with improved postural stability in older adults. In particular, we may suggest that the features of the raised heel edge and more rigid materials can contribute to improved postural stability in older adults. Since postural instability is a major risk factor for falls in older adults (Rubenstein, 2006), these findings may suggest that insole interventions have the potential to serve as a feasible and practical solutions to reducing fall risks in older adults. Effects of insole interventions on fall risks in older adults should be investigated in a future randomized controlled trial study.
