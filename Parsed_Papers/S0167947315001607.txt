                  A Moment Ratio estimator is proposed for an AR(
                        p
                     ) model of the errors in an OLS regression, that provides standard errors with far less median bias and confidence intervals with far better coverage than conventional alternatives. A unit root, and therefore the absence of cointegration, does not necessarily mean that a correlation between the variables is spurious. The estimator is applied to a quadratic trend model of real GDP. The rate of change of GDP growth is negative with finite standard error but is insignificant. The “output gap,” often used as a guide to monetary policy, has an infinite standard error and is therefore a statistical illusion.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Serial correlation is a pervasive problem in time series models in econometrics, as well as in statistics in general. When, as is often the case, positive serial correlation is present in both the errors and the regressors, it has long been well known that the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates of the standard errors are generally too small, and hence the derived 
                        t
                     -statistics too large (Bartlett, 1935; Quenouille, 1952). If the form and parameters of the error serial correlation were known, it would be elementary to compute correct standard errors for OLS regression coefficients. However, observed regression residuals are typically much less persistent than the unobserved regression errors. Correlations estimated directly from the regression residuals therefore provide inadequate indication of the serial correlation that is actually present. This problem is particularly severe as the persistence in the errors approaches or even reaches a unit root.

The present paper proposes a Moment Ratio (MR) estimator for the parameters of an Autoregressive (AR) model of the errors in an OLS regression. Although it is computed from the conventional residual correlation coefficients, it reduces their negative bias, and provides standard errors with far less median bias and confidence intervals with far better coverage than conventional alternatives. The MR estimator is in the spirit of the Median Unbiased estimator of Andrews (1993) and McCulloch (2008), but does not require laborious Monte Carlo simulation of the distribution of the sample autocorrelations. By allowing the AR order to increase with the sample size by the same formula that is commonly used for Newey–West (1987) Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent (NW-HAC) covariance matrix, the MR estimator shares its consistency with respect to autocorrelation, while greatly mitigating its substantial finite-sample bias.

A unit root in the errors requires reposing the problem, greatly increases the variance of OLS slope coefficients, and renders the intercept unidentified, but otherwise presents no insurmountable difficulties. In particular, the presence of a unit root in the errors does not by itself indicate that OLS slope coefficients are spurious. A unit root test similar in spirit to that of Andrews and Chen (1994) is developed that has only moderate size distortion in simulations using a trend line regression. An MR-HAC estimator that generalizes the White (1980) Heteroskedasticity Consistent Covariance (HCC) matrix is proposed to capture regressor-conditional heteroskedasticity. It is found to have less finite-sample bias and better coverage than the NW-HAC estimator in simulated regressions.

The Moment Ratio estimator is applied to a quadratic trend model of US real GDP. OLS, NW-HAC, and even AR(4) standard errors are found to greatly overstate the precision of the coefficients, and all give the misleading impressions that the terminal output gap of −4.80% in 2014Q2 is significantly negative, and that the rate of change of GDP growth is significantly negative. The Moment Ratio persistence coefficient estimate is quite close to unity, and a unit root in the errors cannot be rejected. Using the preferred “blended” covariance matrix, the “output gap” has infinite variance and therefore is illusory, and the estimated secular rate of decline of GDP growth of −2.82% per annum per century is statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, expected GDP growth in 2014Q2 of +2.30% per annum remains strongly significant and positive despite the absence of cointegration.

The Moment Ratio estimator is particularly simple and intuitive in the case of AR(1) errors. Accordingly, Section  2 first develops the “MR(1)” model, i.e. the MR estimator in the case of AR(1) errors, and compares the derived standard errors to conventional alternatives. Section  3 then develops the MR(
                        p
                     ) estimator, which extends the MR(1) estimator to a more general AR(
                        p
                     ) error process. Section  4 applies the MR estimator to a quadratic trend model of US real GDP. Section  5 concludes. Several figures in the submitted paper were omitted here for reasons of space but are included in a Supplementary Information file provided online with this article (see Appendix A). These figures are referred to here as SI-1, etc.

Section  2.1 reviews basic formulas and establishes notation for a linear regression whose errors follow a general autocorrelated process. Section  2.2 develops the MR(1) estimator, i.e. the Moment Ratio estimator when the errors follow a stationary AR(1) process. The unit root case requires reposing the problem somewhat, and is treated in Section  2.3. Section  2.4 discusses the inherent weaknesses of the Newey–West (1987) HAC covariance matrix. Section  2.5 investigates the Monte Carlo properties of the MR(1) estimator, while Section  2.6 develops a unit root test for the AR(1) case.

                         Definition (5) follows Hayashi (2000, 408), Greene (2003, 268), and others, by taking the ratio of the sum of

                        . Percival (1993) notes that time series texts commonly refer to these as the “biased” and “unbiased” estimators, respectively, although both in fact can be biased. The Moment Ratio estimator developed in Sections  2 and 3 could as easily be based on the strong autocorrelations, with identical results, but this would require adding the additional factor to the formulas.

                        , along with an unbiased estimate of its variance. Thus, for example, Canjels and Watson (1997) and Choi et al. (2008) recommend using Feasible GLS (FGLS), based on an estimate of the covariance structure. However, this covariance estimate must be based on the residuals of a preliminary OLS regression, and it is recommended that the Moment Ratio covariance matrix developed here be used for this purpose.

These estimated autocovariances initially behave in a qualitatively similar fashion to the true autocovariances. However, they exhibit several typical problems when positive serial correlation is present in both the errors and the regressors: first,

                         whenever a constant term is included in the regression, so that the sample autocorrelations of order 1 and higher are necessarily negative on average even if the true autocorrelations are all positive. And fourth, when serial correlation is high they tend to exhibit the spurious oscillations that characterize trend line residuals with unit root or near unit root errors (Nelson and Kang, 1981). Because of these qualitatively misleading properties, the highest order sample autocorrelations should be ignored altogether.

                         this ratio is less than unity, and hence

                         is downward biased, despite its “bias correction”. This bias depends on the observed regressor matrix

                         is approached, this bias actually becomes −100%, since

                         is necessarily finite when an intercept is included in the regression.

                           φ
                         increases to 1. The bias may also be computed for

                           <
                           0

                        Andrews (1993) has noted that a pattern similar to that in Fig. 3 emerges when the median of the Monte Carlo distribution of the OLS estimator of 
                           φ
                         is plotted against 
                           φ
                        . Andrews proposes that an Exactly Median Unbiased estimator of 
                           φ
                         be computed by numerically inverting this median function. In a precursor to the present paper (McCulloch, 2008), the author implements and extends Andrews’ method to find exactly median unbiased estimators of all the coefficients of an AR(
                           p
                        ) model for regression errors. However, the Moment Ratio approach of the present paper gives very similar results, without the tedious and noisy Monte Carlo simulation at each step of the numerical search.

The unit root case 
                           φ
                           =
                           1
                         poses no insurmountable problems, so long as there is a constant term and a trend or trending variable(s) in the original regression (1), and so long as the regression residuals are not used to estimate the variance of the innovations. In particular, a unit root in the errors does not in itself indicate a “spurious regression” in which OLS coefficient slope estimates become meaningless. However, it does require reposing the problem, so as to replace certain undefined mathematical expressions with their limiting values. We assume that 
                           φ
                           ∈
                           
                              (
                              −
                              1
                              ,
                              
                              1
                              ]
                           
                        , so that a unit root is the only type of nonstationarity that will be encountered.

As is well known, OLS coefficient estimates are inconsistent when both the regressor(s) and the errors contain a unit root with no drift (see e.g. Choi et al., 2008, 330). Conditional on the observed regressor(s) and the finite innovation variance, the limiting coefficient error is Gaussian with positive variance. Even so, there may be a problem of estimating the innovation variance from even the estimated innovations if the residuals themselves are not consistently estimated. Nevertheless, when the regression includes a constant and a time trend, the slope coefficient becomes 
                           √
                           n
                         consistent: Hayashi (2000, 570) shows that after scaling the horizontal axis by 
                           n
                         and the vertical axis by 
                           √
                           n
                        , the slope coefficient is Gaussian about its true value with a finite variance. Without the scaling, the slope coefficient is therefore Gaussian with standard error proportional to 
                           1
                           /
                           √
                           n
                        . Likewise, if the regressor is unit root with non-zero drift, the drift will dominate the unit root noise for large 
                           n
                        , and so the regressor will act as if it were a time trend. This section is therefore limited to the case in which the regressors include either a time trend or a trending variable.

                         of the innovations in (11) constant. Furthermore, each element of the correlation matrix 
                           
                              R
                           
                         becomes unity in this limit. These matrices are therefore no longer useful or informative in this case, and the problem must be reposed without them. Although a random walk has infinite unconditional variance and covariances, its variances and covariances are all finite conditional on its value at any point in time, say 
                           t
                           =
                           0
                        . If the errors are a random walk that arise by accumulating white noise

Simulations with Gaussian errors indicate that for a model in which only a constant term is estimated, its distribution is approximately a scaled

With no loss of generality, the remaining elements of its first row and column may be set to 0, since the variance of any linear combination of the intercept and the regressors is infinite regardless of these covariances. The inverse of the unconditional unit root covariance matrix will be of use below when we compute a blended covariance matrix in the near-unit-root cases. It may be seen from the partitioned matrix inversion rule that the inverse of

The truncated-kernel Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent (HAC) covariance matrix, introduced by Newey and West (1987), is now widely used by economists to “correct” the standard errors of OLS time series coefficients for serial correlation. Greene (2003, 201) reports that its use is now “standard in the econometrics literature”. Hayashi (2000, 409–12) mentions only it, the similar Quadratic Spectral HAC of Andrews and Monahan (1992), and the Vector Autoregression HAC (VAR-HAC) method of den Haan and Levin (1997) as appropriate methods for correcting OLS standard errors for serial correlation. The elementary text by Stock and Watson (2007) presents HAC as the only method worthy of mention.

                         in the range 50–2000, and generally identical effect in the range 400–1000. Sun et al. (2008) note that while a power of 1/3 or 1/5 minimizes the asymptotic mean squared error of the long-run variance estimator for first and second order kernels, respectively, a power of 1/2 or 1/3 asymptotically minimizes a weighted average of Type I and Type II errors.

At least three types of heteroskedasticity are commonly encountered in econometrics: in a priori heteroskedasticity, the variance of the errors is known up to a common constant, and Weighted Least Squares (WLS) provides efficient coefficient estimates and correct standard errors. In serially conditional heteroskedasticity, episodes of high and low variance errors are clustered, in which case a GARCH model is often appropriate (McCulloch, 1985; Bollerslev, 1986). And finally, in what might be called Regressor Conditional Heteroskedasticity (RCH), the variance of the errors may depend in an unknown way on the equation’s regressors. The White (1980) HCC and Newey–West HAC estimators correct consistently for RCH, though not necessarily for the other two forms of heteroskedasticity unless they coincidentally coincide.

In the benchmark case of regressor-conditional homoskedasticity, the expectation of the HAC estimator becomes

For all three of these reasons, it tends in finite samples to underestimate the standard error for a regressor which is itself serially correlated. However, the amount by which it does this depends on both the

Aside from its RCH adjustment, the NW-HAC estimator in effect therefore replaces the already twice-downward-biased

                        . Furthermore, as long as

                         also rises to infinity, each autocorrelation is consistently estimated (Newey and West, 1994, 633). However, it is shown in Section  2.5 that in finite samples the estimator can be highly misleading.


                        Politis (2011) finds that a flat-top kernel and a data-driven bandwidth somewhat alleviate the downward bias in the Newey–West estimator. In order to ensure that the resulting covariance matrix is positive semidefinite, he must rectify it by zeroing out any negative eigenvalues in its singular value decomposition. Nevertheless, he also uses residuals as if they were errors, with no compensation for their biased variance.

                           100
                        , under the additional assumption of Gaussian errors. The median line is essentially the same as the median function inverted by Andrews (1993) to determine his Median Unbiased estimator of the autoregressive parameter 
                           φ
                        . The Moment Ratio Function is almost indistinguishable from the median for values of 
                           φ
                         near 0, but rises slightly above the median as 
                           φ
                         increases. Nevertheless, it remains well within the quartiles, and at least approximately corrects the median bias of

                         pulls the mean of the distribution down below the median by a comparable amount. This simulation was performed with 
                           m
                           =
                           99,999
                         replications using MATLAB’s randn(‘state’) Gaussian random number generator, for 
                           φ
                         in steps of 0.01. The same seed was used for each value of 
                           φ
                         in order to make each simulated percentile a smooth function of

                         is necessarily less than the Median Unbiased estimator computed by inverting the Monte Carlo median function at

                        , and therefore provides a less conservative adjustment for serial correlation, at least for the trend line problem simulated.

                         are based on 10,000 Monte Carlo replications of a trend line regression with 
                           n
                           =
                           100
                         equally spaced and demeaned values of the time trend variable, Gaussian AR(1) errors, and various true values of 
                           φ
                         ranging from −0.2 to 1.0, inclusive. The “AR(1)” model is fit to the (weak) sample autocorrelation

                        , in conjunction with an estimate of 
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                         that is unbiased conditional on 
                           φ
                           =
                           
                              
                                 r
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                         per (7). The “HAC” results are based on a bandwidth of 
                           m
                           =
                           4
                        , using formula (32). Fig. 5 shows the Monte Carlo median of the estimated variance of the slope coefficient, relative to the true variance of the coefficient, so that a value of unity reflects the target of zero median bias. As expected, OLS is right on the mark when the errors are uncorrelated, but then deteriorates rapidly as the degree of serial correlation increases. With random walk errors, the true variance of the slope coefficient still finite, but is 180 times larger than the OLS estimate, because OLS takes no account at all of serial correlation.

NW HAC provides some improvement over OLS for 
                           φ
                         greater than approximately 0.13. However, it already has substantial negative median bias (median/true = 0.90) even when the errors are white noise. This is because HAC takes no account of the distinction, important in finite samples, between the residuals and the errors. However, the AR(1) model that fits 
                           
                              
                                 r
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                         directly to its asymptotic counterpart is a big improvement over HAC for all values of 
                           φ
                        . Finally, the Moment Ratio estimator MR(1) is clearly the leader of the pack by this metric, except for OLS when 
                           φ
                         is very near 0. It easily dominates AR(1) and therefore also HAC for all values of 
                           φ
                        . Because of the upper bound of unity imposed on 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       φ
                                    
                                    
                                       ˆ
                                    
                                 
                              
                              
                                 
                                    MR
                                 
                              
                           
                        , even MR(1) is inevitably somewhat biased downwards, particularly as 
                           φ
                         approaches 1.


                        Fig. 6 gives the Monte Carlo means of the squared standard errors, relative to the true variance of the slope coefficient, rather than the medians as in Fig. 5. OLS, HAC and AR(1) all have mean biases qualitatively similar to the median biases shown in Fig. 5. However, MR(1) now has a positive mean bias for all but the highest values of 
                           φ
                        . For 
                           φ
                           <
                           0.6
                        , this bias is quite small, but for larger values it grows quickly, reaching a peak of +95% at 
                           φ
                           =
                           0.90
                         (corresponding to a RMSE of +40% for the standard error itself). This mean bias is due to the fact that the expected squared standard error is a highly convex function of 
                           φ
                        , especially as 
                           φ
                           =
                           1
                         is approached, so that overestimates of 
                           φ
                         have a much bigger impact on the mean than do underestimates. The medians in Fig. 5 are less affected by this factor, resulting in negative median biases throughout. For 
                           φ
                           >

                         becomes binding more frequently, with the result that under-estimates start to dominate, and the bias turns negative after 0.98. At 
                           φ
                           =
                           1
                        , the mean variance bias is −49%, corresponding to −30% in terms of the RMS standard error.

For most practical purposes, the ultimately relevant criterion is not the mean or median bias of the estimated variances, but rather their ability to construct confidence intervals, and therefore hypothesis tests, with correct coverage. Fig. 7 shows the simulated coverage of a 95% confidence interval for the slope in the same trend line regression with 
                           n
                           =
                           100
                         and Gaussian innovations. The horizontal line at 95% is the target representing perfect coverage. Since 10,000 replications were again used, the sampling standard error of the coverage of a 95% confidence interval is 0.22%. The intercept and slope coefficients were, without loss of generality, both set to 0 for this simulation.

Despite its upward mean bias for the slope variance, the MR(1) size distortion is always negative and becomes increasingly negative throughout the range 
                           
                              [

                        . Although it does not have perfect coverage, the MR(1) estimator always has substantially better performance than HAC or AR(1), and dominates OLS for all

                           >
                           0.14
                        , by this metric. Figure SI-2 in the online Supplementary Information continues Fig. 7 down to 0% coverage, and shows that the relative position of the four lines continues until they reach the 
                           φ
                           =
                           1
                         limit. The pattern for the estimated intercept is qualitatively similar to that shown for the estimated slope in Figs. 5–7, and hence is not shown here.

                         is less than say 0.05, then a unit root can be rejected with a 5% one-tailed test size. Thus, any value of

                         less 0.778 will reject a unit root at the 5% level for the illustrated trend line regression with 
                           n
                           =
                           100
                        . The only practical way to perform this test is with a Monte Carlo simulation comparable to that required for Andrews’ (1993) Median Unbiased estimator, but since the test is optional, and even then the simulation only needs to be performed under the null 
                           φ
                           =
                           1
                        , it is not nearly as computationally demanding as the Median Unbiased estimator.

Although an AR(1) model is often a good first approximation to the autocovariation function of econometric time series regression errors, this model can be unnecessarily restrictive. The true model may not even be a finite order autoregressive process. However, a finite order AR(

                      Although this simple estimator is consistent, it takes no account of the distinction between the errors and residuals and so is biased in finite samples, particularly as the process becomes more persistent and approaches a unit root. The AMM estimator defined in (36) is virtually equivalent to the results of an OLS regression of the residuals on their own 
                        p
                      lags, with the exceptions that it treats the first and last 
                        p
                      residuals symmetrically, and that it employs weak rather than strong autocorrelations.

As in the AR(1) model, the unit root case is not an insurmountable obstacle. However, it does require separate treatment. Following Andrews and Chen (1994), it is useful to rewrite (34) in the equivalent Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) form

                      This problem was solved numerically for this paper with satisfactory results using a Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm (Press et al., 1992, 402–6), modified to be subject to the explicit constraint 
                        α
                        ≤
                        1
                     , and assigning a very high value to the objective function whenever other non-stationary roots were encountered. (An earlier version of this paper instead attempted to equate the first 
                        p
                      sample autocorrelations directly to individual moment ratio functions, with very ill-conditioned results in the vicinity of a unit root. Transforming the AR coefficients to the ADF persistence form (38) before taking the norm in (41) will give the same answer if the unit root restriction is not binding, but a somewhat different answer when it is binding. This distinction may be worth exploring in future work.)

Figures SI-3 and SI-4 in the Supplementary Information plot the Monte Carlo median and mean of the estimated slope variances using the OLS, HAC (

                           4
                        ) estimated by AMM, and MR(

                        ) covariance matrices. Throughout the true DGP is AR(1), again using Gaussian errors and 10,000 replications. Despite the nuisance parameters that have been added for consistency in case the process is not AR(1), the results are qualitatively very similar to those in Figs. 5 and 6, where the true AR(1) structure is imposed. The figures are therefore omitted here for reasons of space. Although MR(
                           p
                        ) and AR(
                           p
                        ) have a greater downward median bias than MR(1) and AR(1), respectively, MR(
                           p
                        ) again clearly dominates both AR(
                           p
                        ) and HAC. AR(
                           p

                        . As is the case with MR(1) in Fig. 6, MR(
                           p
                        ) does have a positive mean bias, which peaks at

Figure SI-5 plots the 95% confidence interval coverages using the MR(
                           p
                        ) estimator of the slope standard error, versus OLS, HAC and AR(
                           p
                        ). The results are qualitatively very similar to those in Fig. 7 and therefore are omitted here for reasons of space. Despite the pronounced positive mean bias of the MR(
                           p
                        ) estimator, its coverage is again under 95% throughout. Nevertheless, MR(
                           p
                        ) dominates all the competitors in terms of coverage bias, except of course for OLS when 
                           φ
                         is very close to 0. Coverages for MR(
                           p
                        ) are included in Figs. 9, but without the comparison to HAC or AR(
                           p
                        ). The greater generality of the MR(
                           p
                        ) and AR(
                           p
                        ) estimators over MR(1) and AR(1) does come at the cost of somewhat greater bias and reduced coverage, because they are not restricted to the true (but in practice unknown) AR(1) DGP. However, graphical comparisons (omitted here in the interest of space) show that this cost is small in comparison to the superiority of MR(
                           p
                        ) over AR(
                           p
                        ) and of AR(
                           p
                        ) over HAC.

Although the MR(
                           p
                        ) estimator greatly improves the coverage of 95% confidence intervals based on the standard Student

                        ) parameters introduces an additional element of uncertainty that is not taken into account by this distribution. Bartlett (1935) has suggested instead using a critical value based on the 
                           t
                         distribution with a reduced “effective degrees of freedom” (EDOF), as implied by the increase in variance caused by the serial correlation adjustment.

This was investigated by constructing 10,000 trend line regressions with random walk errors and conducting the unit root test described above with 10,000 replications each. The size distortion is generally moderate, though there is some positive distortion for nominal size in the range 0–0.18. Table 1
                         tabulates selected values. For example, if the nominal size is 5%, the test in fact falsely rejects a unit root 6.0% of the time. In order to obtain a true type I error of 5%, a nominal size of 4.1% would have to be used. At a 5% test size, the Monte Carlo sampling standard error is approximately 0.2% on both

                         and the estimated actual size. Figure SI-7 (omitted here for reasons of space) plots the actual size versus the nominal size in greater detail.

Ever since the seminal work of Nelson and Plosser (1982), econometric protocol has typically been to test for a unit root and then to either ignore the possibility of a unit root if it can be rejected at some convention test size, say 5%, or else to impose a unit root (typically by re-estimating the equation in first differences) if it cannot be rejected, even when the point estimate falls short of a unit root. However, this practice unfortunately produces results that can change discontinuously and substantially with the data. Fig. 8 shows the coverage of a notional 95% confidence interval for the slope coefficient in our illustrative trend line regression, at the top (dashed line) when a unit root is imposed and at the bottom (thin solid line) when the MR(
                           p
                        ) standard errors are always used, as a function of the true AR(1) parameter 
                           φ
                         of the error DGP, along with a horizontal line indicating the 95% ideal value. Always imposing a unit root leads to a “95% CI” that includes the true value in 10,000 cases out of 10,000, unless 
                           φ
                         is 0.95 or higher, and therefore is ordinarily far too conservative a strategy. On the other hand, the pure MR(
                           p
                        ) estimator, which only uses the unit root formula when the point estimate of the persistence is actually unity, can yield far too small a confidence interval.

This discontinuous behavior can easily be corrected, however, simply by blending the unit root and non-unit root covariance matrices using a continuous function of the unit root test statistic 
                           
                              
                                 p

                        . It would be inappropriate to use a weighted average of the covariance matrices themselves directly, since the unconditional unit root covariance matrix indicates infinite variance for the intercept. However, the unconditional unit root precision matrix (inverse covariance matrix) merely has a zero in this position, which will not dominate a linear combination unless the unit root case is given a 100% weight. Therefore, for a weight

                         between 0.9 and 0.96. Replacing the 10 in the formula with 20 (corresponding to embracing the unit root if it cannot be rejected at the 5% level) was found to over-correct excessively, while replacing it with 5 (corresponding to a 20% test size) was found to under-correct consistently.

                         should increase with the sample size, but the present paper makes no attempt to implement this refinement. Bunzel and Vogelsang (2005) similarly transition smoothly from I(0) to I(1) covariance estimators using a continuous function of a unit root test statistic, while Harvey et al. (2007) interpolate I(0) and I(1)

Although the primary emphasis of the present paper has been the case of regressor-conditional homoskedasticity, a Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent MR estimator (MR-HAC) may be constructed as a generalization of a slightly improved version of the White (1980) HCC estimator: the original HCC estimator for the simple case of OLS regression is

                         This estimator has a downward finite sample bias because the regression residuals generally have smaller variance than the errors themselves. Furthermore, when non-trivial regressors are present, the residuals will be heteroskedastic even when the errors are homoskedastic. In the benchmark case of regressor-conditional homoskedasticity and in the absence of serial correlation, (6) becomes

                         When serial correlation is present, our strategy will be to first approximate the serial correlation with a homoskedastic AR(
                           p
                        ) process and to construct its MR estimator as above, and then to construct an unbiased and heteroskedasticity-consistent estimator in terms of the estimated innovations to the approximating process rather than the residuals themselves.

When the approximating homoskedastic AR(
                           p
                        ) process is stationary, let

                        Fig. 9 illustrates the Monte Carlo 95% CI coverage for both the MR(
                           p
                        ) and MR-HAC estimators. Surprisingly, there is essentially no difference in performance, despite the here-unnecessary greater generality of MR-HAC. Figure SI-8, omitted here for reasons of space, shows that the same is true for the median bias of the two estimators.

The comparisons between the MR(
                           p
                        ) and NW-HAC estimators discussed above and illustrated in Figures SI-5 and SI-6 are not entirely fair, since NW-HAC attempts to be more general with its RCH correction. This greater generality naturally costs it precision when the additional generality is not really necessary. The comparison between MR-HAC and NW-HAC in Fig. 9 overcomes this objection, by showing that MR-HAC has less size distortion than NW-HAC for all 
                           φ

                           0.18
                        . Figure SI-8 in the Supplementary Information shows that the same is true for their median bias for all 
                           φ
                           >

                        .

An alternative way to make a fair comparison between the two approaches is to eliminate the RCH adjustment in NW-HAC by defining the “NW-AC” (for Autocorrelation Consistent) estimator, simply by replacing the

                           c
                         is an asymptotic correction for bias. The analytical computations of Abadir and Paruolo (1996, 2002) demonstrate that in terms of the above 2002 version of the statistic (which differs by a factor of 2 from that in the 2000 paper), 
                           c

                        . While KVB has the advantage that it makes no parametric assumptions about the form of the serial correlation, it is inconsistent in that the limiting covariance estimate is merely an unbiased random variable, rather than a limit in probability.

It may be seen from Figs. 9 and SI-8 that the KVB estimator is superior to NW-HAC in terms of 95% CI coverage for all

                      The visual fit is quite good, and there is a pronounced decline in the local rate of growth over the sample period. Output appears to be distinctly below the local trend in the last five years of the sample. Such a deviation of output from local trend is often used as a guide to monetary policy (Taylor, 1993). All variables were normalized to 0 in the last observation, so that

                     Table 2
                      gives the OLS estimates of the quadratic parameters, along with several measures of their standard deviations. The estimate of the intercept 
                        a
                      indicates that the “output gap” in 2014Q2 was −4.80% relative to the quadratic trend. The estimate of the linear term 
                        b
                      indicates that in the same quarter, the expected growth rate of GDP was down to 2.30% per annum. The estimate of the quadratic term 
                        c
                      indicates that GDP growth is falling at a rate of 2.82 (2 × 1.41) percent per annum per century. The OLS standard errors, taken at face value, indicate that all three coefficients are strongly significantly different from zero. The popular Newey–West HAC standard errors shown in the next row of Table 2 are 98%–157% greater than the OLS standard errors, when a bandwidth of 
                        m
                        =
                        4
                      is employed, as determined by (32), but still indicate that all three coefficients are strongly significantly different from zero. However, even though these standard errors are consistent, in finite samples they are triply biased downwards, and hence still give pronounced size distortion, as demonstrated in the simulations in Section  2.5.

The standard errors identified as AR(4) in Table 2 were obtained by fitting an AR(4) model to the first 4 residual autocorrelations, shown in Table 3
                     , by means of the Yule–Walker equations as in (36). These standard errors are another 44%–76% larger than the HAC standard errors, depending on the coefficient. With these standard errors, the output gap falls from “strongly significant” (test size 0.01 or lower) to merely “significant” (test size 0.05 or lower), but the other two coefficients remain strongly significant. However, these standard errors still understate the uncertainty because residual autocorrelations generally show less persistence than the true autoregressive process.

The MR(4) coefficients in Table 3 show even more persistence than the AR(4) AMM coefficients. Although the difference in total persistence is not great (
                        α
                        =
                        0.958
                      versus 0.936), the MR(4) standard errors in Table 2 are another 45%–46% higher than the unadjusted AR(4) standard errors. The intercept 
                        a
                     , and therefore the “output gap” for 2014Q2, is now insignificant at even the weak 10% level, but the other two coefficients remain highly significant. Although the MR(4) estimate of the persistence 
                        α
                      falls short of unity, the unit root test statistic 
                        
                           
                              p
                           
                           
                              
                                 UR
                              
                           
                        
                        =
                        0.105
                      so that a unit root cannot be even weakly rejected. This exceeds 10%, so that the preferred “blended” covariance matrix simply equals the unconditional unit root covariance matrix. These standard errors are shown in the last line of Table 2. Although the terminal growth rate of 2.30% per annum remains highly significant, the rate of decline of the growth rate is now not even weakly significant.

In sum, although a quadratic trend line fits US log GDP quite well visually, there is no evidence that the estimated “output gap” of −4.80% for 2014Q2 is anything more than a statistical illusion, despite its status as a guide for monetary policy (Taylor, 1993). Even by the MR(4) standard error of 3.29%, this value is not significantly different from zero. The preferred blended standard error for the intercept and therefore the output gap is actually infinite. The blended standard errors indicate that the apparent declining trend in the growth rate is not statistically significant. However, the terminal growth rate estimate of 2.30% per annum remains strongly significant, even though the blended covariance matrix is here equal to the unconditional unit root covariance matrix and therefore assumes no cointegrating relationship.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The proposed Moment Ratio Estimator for the autoregressive parameters of the errors in an OLS regression is computed from the conventional residual autocorrelation coefficients, but gives far less bias, and provides coefficient confidence intervals with far less size distortion, than the available alternatives considered. The estimator is in the spirit of the Median Unbiased estimator of Andrews (1993) and McCulloch (2008), but does not require a Monte Carlo simulation except for the optional unit root test. The presence of a unit root in the errors, and therefore the absence of a cointegrating relationship, does require reposing the problem, but does not by itself indicate that an OLS correlation between the variables is spurious.

It has been shown that despite their consistency, the popular HAC standard errors of Newey and West (1987) can greatly overstate the precision of OLS coefficient estimates with sample sizes and serial correlation commonly found in economic studies. Although the author does not believe that the regressor-conditional heteroskedasticity targeted by the Newey–West HAC estimator is typically as serious a problem in econometric data as serial correlation, a “Moment Ratio-HAC” procedure is proposed that attempts to incorporate this consideration. Surprisingly, there is relatively little cost in terms of size distortion to employing it when errors are in fact independent of the regressors, at least in the simple model considered.

Although the factorizations that motivate the MR estimator rely on the strong assumption that the errors are independent of the regressors, the author is optimistic that the MR estimator developed here will have favorable properties when the regressors are merely weakly exogenous. Feasible GLS estimates would provide more efficient estimates of the regression coefficients than the OLS estimates considered here, but any such GLS estimates should be based on preliminary MR estimates of the covariance structure.
