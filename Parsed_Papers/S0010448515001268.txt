                  Mechanisms, defined as assemblies of dimensioned rigid bodies linked by ideal joints, can be partitioned in three mobility states: the rigid state (where bodies can have only one position relative to each other), the mobile state (where bodies can move relatively to each other) and the impossible state (where bodies dimensions and specified joints cannot lead to a feasible assembly). It is also clear that although bodies dimensions can vary in a continuous way, assemblies may experience quite abrupt changes across those states. This paper proposes a new approach to this problem with the goal of being able to predict the mobility class of an assembly of arbitrary complexity, and how it can be affected by a perturbation of the dimensions of its bodies. It does so by proposing a simple and general state transition framework including the three above defined states and seven transitions describing how a dimensional perturbation can affect them. Using this framework, the mobility of a mechanism is easier to capture and predict, using only dimensional (
                        u
                     ) and positional (
                        p
                     ) parameters involved in an appropriate equation (
                        F
                        
                           (
                           u
                           ,
                           p
                           )
                        
                        =
                        0
                     ). This is achieved by focusing on how 
                        F
                        
                           (
                           )
                        
                      behaves when 
                        u
                      and 
                        p
                      get perturbed, and the impact of this reaction on the mobility state of the assembly. As a result of this more mathematic approach to the problem, previously used notions of iso-constraint, over-constraint and paradoxical assembly, traditionally used to describe such assemblies, can be rigorously defined and thus clarified.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

We are interested in designing and manufacturing physical mechanisms and understanding their properties in a formal setting. Variations in design can be obtained by perturbing dimensions, but this has an effect on the resulting mobility of the mechanism. Therefore, starting from an initial state, the point is to converge to a final design with the same mobility. Furthermore, a physical mechanism can never be manufactured at nominal dimensions. The point is also to understand how dimensional uncertainty can influence the properties of factory-made mechanisms.

The goal of this paper is to simplify definitions and investigation of properties of mechanisms. The focus is put on rigidity and mobility, which are widely studied  [1–5]. The concept of mechanism used in this theory is very general since only basic semantic is involved. Dimensional parameters noted 
                        u
                      define the dimensions of rigid bodies. They are set by the designer as input values of the equation. Positional parameters noted 
                        p
                      define relative positions of rigid bodies. They are the unknowns of the equation. Constraints, joints, links, etc. complete the system by mixing 
                        u
                      and 
                        p
                      parameters into an equation 
                        F
                        
                           (
                           u
                           ,
                           p
                           )
                        
                        =
                        0
                     . Only general properties of the equation are used. How rigid bodies and constraints are involved is not detailed, provided it results in a 
                        F
                        
                           (
                           u
                           ,
                           p
                           )
                        
                        =
                        0
                      type equation where function 
                        F
                      features the appropriate smoothness. The theory proposed in this paper is valid whether group theory, graph theory, Cartesian or non Cartesian, relative or absolute modeling  [3,6–14] is used to set up the equation.

The behavioral principle is to deliberately ignore the formulation of the equation and to focus on how function 
                        F
                      behaves under parameters perturbations. Given

                                 u

                        0
                     , the question is to completely figure out what can happen when 
                        
                           
                              u

                      and/or 
                        
                           
                              p
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                      is perturbed. Does the assembly still exist? If yes, is rigidity or mobility saved or lost?

To reach this goal, the first step is to define states of the assembly. An assembly can be either “rigid”, “mobile” or “impossible”. States definitions are inspired by considering the positional parameter under a fixed dimensional parameter. The second step is to define all transitions from one state to another, postulating that the cause of a transition is a dimensional perturbation. In other words, can an assembly switch from any state to any other state, is there any sink state? It is well known that mechanism design must cope with non generic situations  [1,2,15–20]. This is the reason why the present paper thoroughly investigates the nature and the effect of dimensional perturbations.

The landscape being dressed through the states and transitions, sufficient conditions on function 
                        F
                      are investigated in order to understand how differential properties are related to behaviors. Surprisingly, it is proven that some transitions are never possible due to smoothness and invariance properties of function 
                        F
                     . Furthermore, it is proven that some transitions are not accessible under first order condition: second order conditions must be investigated. These concepts are compared to traditional definitions like iso-constrained, over-constrained, paradoxical, thus bringing precision and clarification. Each situation is illustrated by an actual mechanism: either a planar rigid bars arrangement, or a crankshaft.

Section  2 recalls the classical Kutzbach–Grubler mobility index, as it is mentioned all through the paper for comparison. Section  3 compares the present approach with combinatorial rigidity. Section  4 defines the notion of mechanism at the appropriate level of abstraction. Section  5 provides mathematical definitions of the states. Section  6 defines and illustrates all possible transitions from one state to another. The important result is related to transitions from the “impossible” state. Section  7 exhaustively investigates sufficient conditions for state and transitions based on first order differential properties of function 
                        F
                     . It also provides a track for second order analysis through bifurcation theory. After the state transition approach is set, Section  8 provides comparison with traditional notions. Section  9 exemplifies the analysis on the very classical crankshaft mechanism. Depending on the nature of the crank–rod joint, this mechanism exhibits the most interesting features presented in the theoretical sections. Finally, Section  10 concludes just before the mathematical theorems and lemmas of the Appendix.

Existing formula to compute the mobility index (also named the number of degrees of freedom) of a mechanism is known as the Kutzbach–Grubler criterion, as thoroughly investigated in  [2] and references therein. Consider a mechanism involving 
                        
                           
                              n
                           
                           
                              b
                           
                        
                      bodies through 
                        
                           
                              n
                           
                           
                              j
                           
                        
                      joints. Let 
                        n
                      be the sum of degrees of freedom of joints, each one considered independently. Then, the Kutzbach–Grubler criterion computes the so called mobility index 
                        δ
                      of the mechanism by

                        g
                      is a constant number depending on the nature of the mechanism. In fact, 
                        g
                      is the number of degrees of freedom of an unconstrained arbitrary body. Planar and spherical mechanisms require

                      arcs, respectively associated with joints. Each arc is labeled with the joint’s degrees of freedom, meaning that 
                        n
                      is the sum of all labels. This graph is illustrated each time in the following. It is proven in  [2] that (1) is questionable in many practical situations, and the connection with the present work is interesting.

The purpose of this section is to compare the present approach with the combinatorial rigidity theory  [3–5]. The reader who is not familiar with this theory can skip this section. Combinatorial rigidity investigates structures made of rigid bars connected at their end points by spherical joints. The combinatorial aspect is the logical graph underlying the structure: bars are modeled by edges and joints are modeled by vertices. The theory provides criteria for generic rigidity of such structures.

The first drawback is that it handles spherical joints only, while many other kinds of joint are needed in mechanical design: cylindrical, prismatic, revolute, coplanar, etc. Mechanism of Figs. 6, 8 and 18 involve prismatic joints. Assembly of Figs. 10 and 14 could be modeled by a graph made of rigid bars connected at their end points, but this would artificially increase complexity and dimensioning.

The second drawback is that combinatorial rigidity does not explicitly deal with dimensional parameters. Variables of the edge function and its derivative, the rigidity matrix (the key feature of the theory) are vertices coordinates of the graph structure. The theory is not suited to investigate dimensional parameters influence. Indeed, combinatorial rigidity handles genericity from the vertices coordinates points of view, which makes a big difference with the present approach. For example, assemblies of Figs. 2 and 4 are generically rigid form the combinatorial theory point of view: any small perturbation of vertices (joints) coordinates yields an assembly of the same nature. From the mechanical designer point of view, the situation is totally different. Any small perturbation of bars lengths of assembly in Fig. 2 yields an assembly of the same nature. It is generic in this sense. Conversely, there exists arbitrary small perturbations of bars lengths of assembly in Fig. 4 that makes it impossible. It is not generic in this sense. Bars lengths are not independent, they must fit a special relationship, as investigated by Proposition 3. This makes a fundamental difference from the manufacturing point of view.

The concept of abstract mechanism is set up to deal with any kind of mechanism, while saving the semantic of dimensional vs. positional parameters. It should be understood as an abstract way to model any mechanism. In the following, symbols 
                        U
                      and 
                        P
                      represent parameters spaces. For sake of generality, these spaces should be manifolds and used with local maps to finite dimensional euclidean spaces. Nevertheless, for simplicity and since local analysis is performed all through the paper, parameters spaces are defined as finite dimensional spaces. The only exception is Proposition 1 where the nature of spaces 
                        U
                      and 
                        P
                      is particularly considered.

                            is the space of positional parameters,

                              →
                              E
                            is a smooth function.

Function 
                        F
                      captures the nature of the mechanism. It involves dimensional and positional parameters according to rigid bodies and joints. Function 
                        F
                      is supposed to be twice continuously differentiable despite it is generally analytic. Furthermore, the derivative of 
                        F
                      with respect to all its variables is supposed to be full rank. The equation of the mechanism is then 
                        F
                        
                           (
                           u
                           ,
                           p
                           )
                        
                        =
                        0
                     , which is a shortcut to deal with 
                        k
                      scalar equations.

                     Definition 2 makes the connection with the classical notion of workspace. This concept, which is very popular in robotics  [21], is used to describe the space of feasible positions of mobile mechanisms, and it can be connected to the present work.

The concept of state is mainly driven by rigidity and mobility of assemblies. Nevertheless, an “impossible” state is necessary in order to complete the landscape. As opposed to usual definitions  [1,2] the following ones are based on the behavior of function

                     . If function 
                        F
                      is analytic, the following definitions are the only possibilities.

                         insuring this behavior are investigated through sufficient conditions in further section.

From the vocabulary point of view, “flexible” is widely used as well and means the same as “mobile”. For clarity, a single word is selected, which is “mobile”.

                         insures that the arc 
                           t
                           ↦

                              )
                           
                         does not degenerate into a unique point, meaning that the positional parameter 
                           p
                         actually changes in such a way that the components of the mechanism actually move with respect to one another. By definition, function 
                           p
                         is smooth if its first derivative 
                           
                              
                                 p

                         is continuous. Consequently, the definition is equivalent to: 
                           
                              
                                 p

                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                           ≠
                           0
                         for all 
                           t
                           ∈
                           
                              ]
                              −
                              ε
                              ,
                              ε
                              [
                           
                        , possibly by choosing a smaller 
                           ε
                           >
                           0
                        .

Furthermore, the definition does not say that the arc 
                           p
                           =
                           p
                           
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                         is unique. This includes situations where a continuum of arcs exists, which occurs when the assembly features more than one degree of freedom. The definition includes as well bifurcation situations typically featuring two arcs crossing at point 
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                        .

Here again, the question of how function 
                           F
                         fits the definition will be investigated later.


                        Definitions 2–4 state that an assembly is such that 
                           F
                           =
                           0
                        . Rigorously, the word “assembly” may not be reused to define a situation where 
                           F
                           ≠
                           0
                        . For this reason and for clarity, the word “configuration” is preferred in Definition 5. 
                           Definition 5
                           An impossible configuration is a dimensional parameter 
                                 
                                    
                                       u
                                    
                                    
                                       0
                                    
                                 
                               such that the partial function 
                                 p
                                 ↦
                                 F
                                 
                                    (
                                    
                                       
                                          u
                                       
                                       
                                          0
                                       
                                    
                                    ,
                                    p
                                    )
                                 
                               has no zero.

Previous section defines three states for an assembly or configuration of a mechanism. This concept of state deals with the behavior of the positional parameter 
                        p
                      under a given and fixed dimensional parameter 
                        
                           
                              u
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                     . Conversely, the concept of transition deals with the question: how a perturbation of the dimensional parameter can change the state of an assembly or a configuration? For example, given a mobile assembly 
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 u
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     , does a perturbation 
                        
                           
                              u
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                        +
                        u
                      save mobility, or does it make the assembly rigid, or does it change the assembly into an impossible configuration?

It is important, at this point of the investigation, to make precise the nature of the dimensional perturbation. The dimensional perturbation is “small” in the following sense. Let 
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 u
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      be a rigid (resp. mobile) assembly. The first situation is the following: there exists 
                        ε
                        >
                        0
                      such that for any dimensional perturbation 
                        
                           
                              u

                        ∈

                      is a sequence of rigid (resp. mobile) assemblies. But it is proven in the following that this situation is not possible.

The benefit of the approach is that, since there are only three states, there exists, a priori, nine transitions. Indeed, considering the graph in Fig. 1
                         where states are nodes and transitions are directed arcs, at most nine arcs join three nodes, including arcs connecting a node to itself. This section investigates each transition and provides, in each case, either an assembly example or a proof that the transition is not possible. Assembly examples are made simple enough to be understood by intuition. Of course, they can be resolved by hand or by using existing theories  [3–5] but the goal is to exemplify the transitions, not to solve elementary situations.

Typical example is the following planar five rigid articulated bars system (Fig. 2
                        ). Let 
                           a
                        , 
                           b
                        , 
                           c
                        , 
                           d
                        , 
                           e
                         be the positive lengths of each bar. The sequence of bars 
                           a
                        , 
                           b
                        , 
                           c
                         and 
                           d
                         is a close loop such that the length of one bar is strictly smaller than the sum of all three others: 
                           a
                           +
                           b
                           +
                           c
                           >
                           d
                         for instance. Bar 
                           e
                         is a diagonal bar connecting joint between bars 
                           a
                         and 
                           b
                         with joint between bars 
                           c
                         and 
                           d
                        . Intuitively, this system is rigid and it is obvious that any small dimensional perturbation results in another five bars rigid system. Even more, there is no way to change this assembly into an impossible configuration through a small dimensional perturbation.

A typical example (Fig. 6
                        ) is a planar crankshaft where the dimensional parameters are the crank length is 
                           a
                           ≠
                           0
                         and the rod length is 
                           b
                           ≠
                           0
                        . It is intuitively obvious that any small perturbation of 
                           a
                         and 
                           b
                         yields another mobile crankshaft.

                           α

The mobility index fails to describe this situation. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig. 9
                        , there are

                           3
                         prismatic joints. Each joint, considered independently, features 1 degree of freedom. Furthermore,

                        . The example is built on a planar four bars articulated assembly (Fig. 10
                        ). Noting 
                           a
                        , 
                           b
                        , 
                           c
                        , 
                           d
                         the positive lengths of the consecutive bars such that 
                           a

                           >
                           d
                        , the mobile polygon is changed into a mobile parallelogram by setting 
                           c
                           =
                           a
                         and

                           b
                        . A fifth bar is added from the middle point of bar 
                           b
                         to the middle point of bar 
                           d
                         through rotoid joints. Of course, the length 
                           e
                         of this additional bar is set 
                           e
                           =
                           a
                        . Clearly, mobility of the initial parallelogram is saved by the additional bar so that the resulting planar five bars assembly is still mobile.

The mobile-to-rigid transition is obtained as follows. First, the assembly in positioned in a rectangular shape. Then, length

The impossible state features a particular property. It is proven here that once an assembly is in the impossible state, there is no chance to escape from it through an arbitrary small dimensional perturbation. This is subtle. It means that a mounted assembly can be the limit of a sequence of impossible configurations but the reverse is not true: an impossible configuration cannot be the limit of a sequence of mounted assemblies. In some way, the collection of impossible configurations is an open set. This is based on general properties of mechanical assemblies captured by function 
                           F
                         and detailed hereafter.

As illustrated in Fig. 13
                        , the actual state transition graph includes seven transitions instead of nine since impossible-to-rigid and impossible-to-mobile transitions are not relevant.

In order to fully understand Proposition 1, let us have a look at function 
                           F
                           
                              (
                              u
                              ,
                              p
                              )
                           
                           =
                           u
                           p
                           −
                           1
                        . Dimensional and positional parameter spaces are respectively 
                           U
                           =
                           R
                         and 
                           P
                           =
                           R
                        . Given a dimensional parameter 
                           u
                        , the corresponding positional parameter given by 
                           F
                           
                              (
                              u
                              ,
                              p
                              )
                           
                           =
                           0
                         is 
                           p
                           =
                           
                              
                                 u
                              
                              
                                 −
                                 1
                              
                           
                        . So, the set of impossible configurations is reduced to 
                           
                              {
                              u
                              =
                              0
                              }
                           
                        , which is not an open subset of 
                           R
                        . This is because function 
                           F
                         does not feature the proportionality 
                           0
                           =
                           F
                           
                              (
                              u
                              ,
                              p
                              )
                           
                           =
                           F

                              λ
                              u
                              ,

                              p
                              )
                           
                         for all 
                           λ
                           >
                           0
                        , and therefore, cannot model a mechanism.

This section systematically investigates situations where a partial derivative of function 
                        F
                      is invertible. Transversality  [22] could be used in Propositions 2–4. Nevertheless, an elementary and systematic approach is preferred in order to deal with generic and non generic situations by using the same tools. It will be seen that transition capabilities are closely related to the nature of the invertible partial derivative. Each theorem is illustrated with an example.

The situation discussed in this subsection is generic: there is no assembly condition, the assembly still exists under any small dimensional perturbation. The hypothesis about the invertible partial derivative implies that the number 
                           k
                         of scalar equations is the same as the number 
                           m
                         of positional parameters.

In the situation discussed in this subsection, an assembly condition comes out as a sub product of implicit function theorem. The hypothesis about the invertible partial derivative implies that the number 
                           k
                         of scalar equations is larger than the number 
                           m
                         of positional parameters, 
                           k
                           >
                           m
                        , and that the number 
                           n
                         of dimensional parameters is such that 
                           n
                           +
                           m
                           ≥
                           k

                         space is of great interest to the mechanical designer. This is a way to understand the mutual influence of dimensional parameters while hiding the role of positional parameters. The choice to separate 
                           u
                         into independent dimensional parameters 
                           v
                         and dependent dimensional parameters 
                           w
                         is not unique. Each one is a new highlight on dimensional parameters dependency.

A practical implementation is to keep one dimensional parameter as a variable and to fix all the others. This way, unknown mappings

The situation discussed in this subsection is generic again. Existence and mobility of the assembly are saved under any small dimensional perturbations. Hypothesis about the invertible partial derivative implies that the number 
                           k
                         of scalar equations is lower than the number 
                           m

This situation is illustrated in drawing (B) of Fig. 10.

Clearly, properties of first order derivation make previous investigation successful, but rigid-to-mobile transition does not fit any of them. This section illustrates how function 
                           F
                         can feature a behavior that requires a second order investigation, mainly the simple bifurcation theory. This theory  [23] is a powerful tool to investigate singularities, see  [24] for example. First case is the planar mobile mechanism made of four articulated bars that is stretched in such a way that the longest length is equal to the sum of all three others, say 
                           d
                           =
                           a
                           +
                           b
                           +
                           c
                        , as illustrated in Fig. 12. Clearly, this assembly is rigid. Furthermore, keeping 
                           a
                        , 
                           b
                         and 
                           c
                         constant and perturbing 
                           d
                         into a smaller value makes the assembly mobile, while perturbing 
                           d
                         into a larger value makes it impossible. In short, the assembly 
                           d
                           =
                           a
                           +
                           b
                           +
                           c
                         is able to rigid-to-mobile transition as well as rigid-to-impossible transition. This behavior fits the state transition framework, but the simple bifurcation theory is mandatory to understand how function 
                           F
                         can feature the phenomenon. Suppose that 
                           d
                           >
                           a
                           +
                           b
                           +
                           c
                         in order to set up the equation. By fixing the ends of bar

                        . The assembly can be flattened but mobility is saved. The particularity is that in the flattened position there is a choice between two motions from point

                        . Here again, first order condition of Propositions 4–6 are not relevant and the simple bifurcation Theorem 2 is mandatory to understand how function 
                           F
                         can feature the phenomenon.

It is time now to compare the previous definitions to the standard vocabulary: iso-constrained, over-constrained, paradoxical etc. First column of Table 1
                      is the list of traditional expressions. Second column includes all possible transitions that an assembly of a given kind can perform. An iso-constrained rigid assembly can only feature the rigid-to-rigid transition, meaning that any small dimensional perturbation does not change the nature of the assembly. An iso-constrained mobile assembly features the same behavior: any small dimensional perturbation changes the initial assembly into another mobile assembly. A over-constrained rigid assembly behaves as follows. Some small dimensional perturbation can change it into an impossible configuration and some other small dimensional perturbation can change it into another rigid assembly. It should be noticed that the present theory defines “over-constrained” by the effect on the assembly. Intuitively, it can be broken by an arbitrary small perturbation. Conversely, traditional definitions deal with counting constraints or scalar equation or computing some rank deficiency. A paradoxical assembly is a mobile assembly that some arbitrary small dimensional perturbation can change into a rigid assembly. Some other arbitrary small dimensional perturbation can change it into another mobile assembly. When characterized by the first order sufficient condition of Proposition 5, some dimensional perturbation can change it into an impossible configuration. The crankshaft mechanism, detailed hereinafter, provides an example of a paradoxical assembly that may not feature the mobile-to-impossible transition.

It can be noticed that, apparently, the rigid-to-mobile transition does not fit any traditional definition.

So far, assembly examples are mainly planar articulated systems of rigid bars. One may argue that they are not realistic from the mechanical point of view. This section provides examples of real life 3D crankshaft mechanism.

As illustrated in Fig. 17
                     , the crankshaft mechanism under study includes three rigid bodies: crank, connecting rod and frame. Rod and frame geometries are idealized by 
                        L
                     -shape wires. Vertical lines of both “
                        L
                     ” being axis for revolute or cylindrical links. Crank geometry is idealized by a 
                        U
                     -shape wire. Lines perpendicular to the horizontal line of the “
                        U
                     ” being axis for revolute or cylindrical links. The rod–frame link, which in real life involves the piston, is idealized by a point–line coincidence. The crank radius is 
                        a
                        >
                        0
                      and the length of the connecting rod is 
                        b
                        >
                        0
                     . A non perfect crank is defined by setting dimensional parameter 
                        α
                        ≠
                        0
                     , meaning that its axis are not parallel (Figs. 17 and 18
                     ). Conversely, a perfect crank is such that 
                        α
                        =
                        0
                     , meaning that its axis are parallel. Once mounted, angle 
                        θ
                      measures the angular position of the crank with respect to the frame (Fig. 18). If the crank is non perfect, parameter 
                        λ
                      measures the sliding offset along the axis shared by the crank and the rod (Fig. 18). General equation of the crankshaft mechanism is the following.

                         which is invertible. Thanks to Proposition 4, the assembly is mobile and the geometric motion is locally parameterized by

                         are provided by the implicit function theorem. Furthermore, mobility is saved under any small perturbation of dimensional parameters

                         in the neighborhood of

                         being zero or not. This means that the mobility is saved whether the crank is perfect or not, as anticipated by (19).

Finally, suppose a revolute crank–rod link (
                           λ
                           =
                           0
                         is a dimensional parameter) and a perfect crank (
                           α
                           =
                           0
                        ). As previously computed (20), the partial derivative 
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 
                                    (

                                    ,
                                    x
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                         is not invertible in the assembly positioning but, from (21), the partial derivative

                                    (

                         is invertible in the assembly positioning. This means that, according to Proposition 5, two unique local functions

                         is an isolated solution of equation

                        , which proves, from Proposition 7, that the assembly is rigid. This means that an arbitrary small and non zero perturbation of parameter 
                           α
                         changes the mobile crankshaft into a rigid one.

There is another way to capture a revolute crank–rod link in the equation. Just substitute parameter 
                           λ
                         by the zero value in function (16). This removes symbol 
                           λ
                         and changes the function into

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study provides a general framework. Given the assembly of a mechanism, it is proven that only three states and seven transitions are possible. This is a valuable help for the mechanism designer through a simple and robust answer when investigating the capacity of a given assembly. One practical result is the ability to navigate on the assembly condition of over-constrained rigid assemblies by using Proposition 3. The study handles not only the fact that a mechanism can feature different behaviors depending on dimensional parameters, but also anticipates the potential behavior changes. Finally, a non negative definition of a paradoxical mechanism is proposed and the hope is to find a simple solution to a difficult problem.

Nevertheless, the present theory remains local. The set of impossible configurations being open, the local theory only provides information at a given point that must be a solution of the equation. In other words, not so much can be said at a point that is not a solution. In particular, whether some dimensional parameters “far” from the given value can change a rigid assembly into a mobile assembly (or vice versa) is still an open question. Recent research  [25] proves that this problem is NP-hard, meaning that a general and efficient solution is out of reach. Other research  [26] investigate the mobility condition computation by using algebraic tools, yielding encouraging results.

There exists a link between mobility and the singularity of partial derivative with positional parameters, named the Jacobian. Indeed, illustration of Propositions 6 and 7 exhibits a rigid assembly with an invertible Jacobian, a rigid assembly with a singular Jacobian and a mobile mechanism with a singular Jacobian.

Future work  [27] is the investigation of mobility condition of a mechanism as a global property, using algebraic tools, and involving singularity of partial derivatives.
