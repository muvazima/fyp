                  Issues related to decision making based on dispersed knowledge are discussed in the paper. A system using a process of combining classifiers into coalitions is used. In this article clusters that are generated using an approach with a negotiation stage are used. Such clusters are more complex and are better able to reconstruct the views of the agents on the classifications. However, a significant improvement is not obtained when we use these clusters without an additional enhancement to the method of conflict analysis. In order to take full advantage of the clustering method, the size and structure of the clusters should be taken into account. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to examine the impact of the method of conflict analysis and the methods that are used to determine the individual weights of the clusters on the effectiveness of the inference in a system that has a negotiation stage. Four new methods for determining the strength of a coalition are proposed and compared. The tests, which were performed on data from the University of California, Irvine Repository, are presented. The results that were obtained are much better than in the case in which the strength of the clusters was not calculated. The approach that consists in the computation of the individual weights from the judgments of each cluster allowed the size and structure of the clusters to be taken into account. This in turn allowed us to take full advantage of a clustering method with a negotiation stage.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The effectiveness of decision making based on dispersed knowledge is an increasingly vital issue. When important economic, medical, enterprise management, business and risk assessment or political issues are to be resolved, groups rather than individuals are employed to make high-quality decisions. In addition, very often many different centers accumulate knowledge on the same subject, but it is stored in separate sets in various forms. Thus, we have access to a dispersed knowledge, which can be processed separately. Compared to individual decision makers, groups have access to more and a broader range of information, which is distributed among group members. So making decisions based on distributed knowledge is more difficult, demanding and requires new methods of inference.

In the paper, issues that are related to decision making that is based on dispersed knowledge are considered. We use the knowledge that is stored in many different knowledge bases, which is a difficult and challenging issue. An example of a real application of this approach can be found, for example, in the medical field. Consider four different medical centers that have different apparatuses and diagnostic methods to detect heart problems. Each medical center has different patients, but some patients may be treated at several of the medical centers. Suppose that one of the medical centers in the database stores information about echocardiograms, cholesterol levels and electrocardiograms (EKGs). Another medical center only examines the level of cholesterol and performs Doppler tests. Another medical center investigates cholesterol and performs computerized tomography (CT) Heart Scans. Another medical center performs echocardiograms, myocardial biopsies and stress tests. Thus, we have the knowledge about the same topic stored in four different databases. There are different objects in these databases, which can sometimes be shared and there are different attributes that also can be shared. Certainly, a decision attribute is a common element that is present in all of these databases, i.e. the information about the heart problem that was diagnosed. The approach that was investigated involves the use of the knowledge that is accumulated in all of the available databases via the process of inference. The situation in the medical field that is described above is also very common in many of the other areas that are mentioned above.

The main concept that we deal with in this paper is dispersed knowledge. We understand knowledge that is stored in several independently gathered knowledge bases to be dispersed knowledge. The issues that are being considered can be assigned to areas of study such as group decision support systems, the multiple model approach and group decision making. In this paper, concepts were taken from the Pawlaks papers (Pawlak, 1984; 1998; 2006)—papers in which a conflict situation that is resolved in a peaceful way is considered. Therefore, like Pawlak, entities that are involved in a conflict that are able to make their own decisions are called agents. In the case that is considered, simple classifiers that are built based on local bases are called agents. In the proposed system, agents are joined into groups, which we call clusters or coalitions. The aim of a group of agents is to take a common decision. The method for the formation groups that is used in the paper is associated with the theory of negotiations and the formation of coalitions and is an extension of Pawlaks work. However, the formation of groups of agents has nothing to do with cluster analysis. Another important concept that is addressed in the paper is conflict analysis. In the paper, it is proposed that different clusters weights and a method that uses a clustering algorithm are used in order to resolve conflicts.

Issues concerning the use of dispersed knowledge were discussed by the authors in earlier papers (Przybyła-Kasperek & Wakulicz-Deja, 2013, 2014a, 2014b; Wakulicz-Deja & Przybyła-Kasperek, 2010, 2011). Part of the methodology that is used in this article is taken from the paper Przybyła-Kasperek and Wakulicz-Deja (2014a), in which a system with a negotiation stage was proposed. The main idea of the process of creating a system structure and formulating coalitions of individual classifiers, which was proposed in the paper (Przybyła-Kasperek & Wakulicz-Deja, 2014a), is as follows. Three types of relations—friendship, conflict and neutrality—are defined between local classifiers. Then a two-stage process of connecting the local classifiers in coalitions, which are groups of classifiers that agree on the classification of the test object, is implemented. In the first step of this process, the local classifiers that remain in a friendship relation are combined into groups. The second step consists of re-examining the relations between the initial coalitions that were created. A negotiation process is implemented, in which in addition to the initial coalitions, the local classifiers that remain in a neutrality relation are included. After this step we get the final form of clusters.

An extension of that system is discussed in this article. The need to extend the system has already been noted in the article (Przybyła-Kasperek & Wakulicz-Deja, 2014a), in which two approaches were compared—an approach with a negotiation stage and an approach without negotiations. The form and structure of the clusters was investigated. The main conclusions that were drawn are as follows. The application of the system that has a negotiation stage allows fewer, but more complex and more numerous clusters, to be generated. Moreover, it was observed that the agents more often belong to more than one cluster in the approach with negotiation. This property is a consequence of the use of a negotiation stage in which neutral agents are connected to each initial cluster with whom their relations are good enough. In general, in the approach with negotiation, the clusters are more complex and therefore better reconstruct and illustrate the views of the agents on the classification. But when the effectiveness of the system’s inference was compared, it was found that a better method for generating clusters is not reflected in the final result. The reason for that was the method of conflict analysis that was used, which did not take into account the size and structure of the clusters, which means that both small and large clusters had the same impact on decision-making. In addition, agents that simultaneously belonged to several clusters in the same way had an influence on the decision in all of the clusters. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a modification of the method of conflict analysis, which consists in the calculation of the agents’ weights that takes into account the size and structure of the clusters as well as some properties that occur in the decisions that are taken by the agents. Because the structure of clusters is quite complex and provides a multitude of aspects that have to be taken into account when determining the weights, four different methods are proposed and compared. In the paper, we present numerous experiments that were performed on dispersed data that had different degrees of complexity. The results that were obtained indicate that the use of the proposed modifications provides much better results and also allows a system with a negotiation stage to be used to the fullest advantage.

In this paper, an extension of the system that was proposed in the article (Przybyła-Kasperek & Wakulicz-Deja, 2014a) is discussed. The two approaches have different methods of conflict analysis. The new proposed approach is compared with the approach that was described in the article (Przybyła-Kasperek & Wakulicz-Deja, 2014a). In Section 6, it is shown experimentally that the results that are generated using these two approaches are completely different. The main contributions of this paper are listed below:

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

Several attempts have already been made to solve the problem of decision making that is based on dispersed knowledge, group decisions and negotiations. Decision support systems (DSS) are computer technology solutions that can be used to support complex decision making and problem solving. Various aspects of decision support issues are discussed in the papers (Shim et al., 2002; Słowiński, Greco, and Matarazzo, 2009, 2014, chap. 19).

The issue of making decisions based on dispersed knowledge is widely discussed in the literature. For example, this issue is discussed in the multiple model approach (Gatnar, 2008; Kuncheva, 2004; Polikar, 2006). In a multiple classifier system, an ensemble is constructed that is based on base classifiers. The aim of this approach is to reduce any misclassification at the cost of increased computational complexity. Ensemble accuracy depends on both the quality of the problem decomposition and the individual accuracies in the base classifiers. One of the methods for decomposition is to use the domain knowledge to decompose the nature of the decisions into a hierarchy of layers (Nguyen, Bazan, Skowron, & Nguyen, 2004). In the papers Oliveira, Morita, and Sabourin (2006), Ślȩzak and Janusz (2011), Widz and Ślȩzak (2012), an ensemble of feature subsets is considered. In the paper (Ho, 1998), a random subspace technique for building an ensemble is considered. A very important matter is that some form of diversity among the base classifiers must exist in order to improve accuracy (Stefanowski, 2005; Tang, Suganthan, & Yao, 2006). The method for generating the final decision also has a significant impact on the efficiency of the ensemble (Fumera & Roli, 2005).

The concept of distributed decision-making is widely discussed in the papers (Schneeweiss, 2003a; 2003b). In addition, the problem of using distributed knowledge is discussed in many other papers (Delimata & Suraj, 2008; Skowron, Wang, Wojna, & Bazan, 2006; Suraj, Gayar, & Delimata, 2006). In the paper Wróblewski (2001), an approach was proposed in which many classifying agents are generated by using fast approximation heuristics, after which a classification system is constructed by selecting the optimal subset of agents.

In decision situations with multiple individuals, group decision support systems play a critical role. When each individual has his/her own private point of view on the way to handle a decision problem, a conflict often arises between them. In the paper Matsatsinis and Samaras (2001), an overview of methodological frames and software systems that have been developed for collaborative decision making is presented, the most representative of which are quoted in the following. In the paper Ntouskas and Polemi (2012), a collaborative decision aid process that is based on multi-criteria decision aid approaches for risk management that aims to categorize security threats is presented. The system JUDGES, which uses a graphical tool in order to discover the consensus and conflicts among individual preferences, is proposed in the paper Colson and Mareschal (1994). The multi-criteria group decision support tool PLEXYS, which uses a 10-level scale for the evaluation of alternatives based on the criteria, is presented in the paper Dennis, George, Jessup, Nunamaker, and Vogel (1988).

The paper Bregar (2014) systematizes and evaluates several existing mechanisms and techniques for group decision-making that limit complexity. The paper Dias and Clímaco (2005) outlines a distributed group decision support system that is suitable to be used over the Internet.

In the paper Cabrerizo, Herrera-Viedma, and Pedrycz (2013), a group decision-making (GDM) problem in which linguistic information is used is considered. The method, which is based on granular computing and pairwise comparisons, was used to consider GDM situations that were defined in heterogeneous contexts, that is, situations in which the experts have different backgrounds and levels of knowledge about the problem. A discussion of pairwise comparisons of objects was presented in the paper Greco, Matarazzo, and Słowiński (2001).

The two-level classification approach to group decision making was proposed in Kuncheva (1995). In the proposed method, the degree of consensus between the first-level fuzzy classifiers is taken into account when forming the final decision. In the paper Yu, Wang, and Lai (2009), an intelligent-agent-based fuzzy group decision-making model is proposed as a tool for the evaluation of credit risk. There are numerous examples in the literature Dong, Zhang, Hong, and Xu (2010); Van Den Honert (2001) that the aggregation of group decisions can be performed at two levels. The first one is the aggregation of individual judgments, which consists in the aggregation of the individual decisions into one judgment that is valid for the group as a whole. In the second one, the aggregation of individual priorities consists in the computation of the individual weights from each individual judgment first and then in obtaining the aggregated decisions from these. In these two approaches, the group is viewed in two different ways (Forman & Peniwati, 1998), either as new individuals that are different from the simple collection of all its members, or as a collection of independent agents that maintain their own identities. In the article Bernasconi, Choirat, and Seri (2014), different aggregation methods for preferences—priority weights in group decision making with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)—were presented. The approach that was developed in the paper Salo (1995) is dedicated to selection tasks in cooperative group decision making. The method proposed there supports several aggregation methods simultaneously—consensus seeking, normative synthesis and the weighting of individual models.

In the paper Herrera, and Sánchez (2005), an aggregation process for managing non-homogeneous information, which have contexts that are composed of numerical, interval values and linguistic values in group decision-making problems, is presented. This aggregation process is based on the unification of the information that is provided by the experts.

In the paper Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015), the issues that are related to the consistency of pairwise comparisons are discussed. Some boundary properties for the inconsistency of group preferences are defined. In the articles Lin et al. (2008), Liu, Zhang, and Wang (2012), the issue of inconsistency quantification is extended to a case that has multiple decision makers.

The theory of negotiations and the formation of coalitions is an important issue of social interaction and it is studied in various branches of the social sciences as well as in computer science. A brief overview of the various negotiation models that have been proposed in the literature can be found in the paper Lopes, Novais, Mamede, and Coelho (2008). Several ways of classifying the existing models of negotiation exist. One of them is to distinguish between two kinds of negotiation models—theoretical and computational models. Theoretical models are proposed for describing, specifying, and reasoning about the key features of negotiating agents (Fatima, Wooldridge, & Jennings, 2005; Kraus, Wilkenfeld, & Zlotkin, 1995; Sandholm, 1999). Computational models are suggested for specifying the key data structures of negotiating agents and the processes that are operating on these structures (Jennings et al., 2001; Kersten & Lai, 2007; Rahwan et al., 2004).

An approach to the issue of coalition formation was discussed in the papers of Pawlak (1984), Pawlak (1998), Pawlak (2006). This model describes a conflict situation in which the agents have decided to analyze the conflict by using a peaceful method. The articles provide a definition of the relations—conflict, friendship and neutrality.

This article describes an approach that is different from all of the multiple model approach mentioned above. The main difference is that we assume that a set of local knowledge bases (base classifiers) that contain information from one domain is determined prior to the process of inference—set up in advance. The only condition that must be satisfied is the occurrence of the same decision attributes in all of the local knowledge bases. In this study, the problem of determining the weights is very important. In this article, the impact of four different methods for calculating agent’s weights on the decisions that are taken by a dispersed decision-making system is examined. In the proposed system, the model for determining the groups of agents is used, which is an extension of the model that was proposed by Pawlak (1984), Pawlak (1998), Pawlak (2006). In this article the issues of conflict and consensus are very important. These issues are also addressed in the group decision support system approach. However, in this study, the basis for conflict is the knowledge that is stored in the decision tables, and the aggregation of this knowledge is done; while in the GDSS approach, conflicts between individual judgments are considered. As was mentioned earlier, in group decision-making problem the degree of consensus and the weights of individual models are also used, but in a different context than in this paper. Also in GDM problem an aggregation process for decisions is analyzed. In this article, the process of group decision making that is based on knowledge that can be represented as different types are considered. The dispersed knowledge that was examined in the experiments has qualitative, quantitative and binary attributes. In order to cope with such a situation, the Gower similarity measure, which enables the analysis of such data, is used (the definition is given in Appendix A). As in GDM problem also in this article, the issue of inconsistency is raised, but in a different context. In decision-making problems with multiple experts, each expert expresses decisions depending on his own knowledge. In the context that is being discussed here, a certain part of the knowledge can be shared. We understand an inconsistency in knowledge to be a situation in which conflicting decisions are made by experts that is based on the shared knowledge. A very important issue that is discussed in this paper is formulating the coalitions and the process of negotiations. This article describes a model which is an extension of the Pawlak model. This paper is based on the concepts that were provided by Pawlak for the analysis of conflict and coalition building.

In this section, the basic concepts that are used in the paper will be introduced. The definitions of a resource agent and a decision table are given below. Then the way to define three types of relations between agents is described and the method for creating a coalition of agents is discussed. These conceptions were introduced in the paper Przybyła-Kasperek and Wakulicz-Deja (2014a). The methods for determining the strength of coalitions, which are the new approach that is presented in this paper, are discussed in the next section.

In a dispersed decision-making system we have access to knowledge in a dispersed form. By the knowledge in a dispersed form we understand the knowledge stored in a set of local knowledge bases. These local bases are collected independently and can be defined in many ways. Therefore they cannot be easily combined into a single coherent knowledge base that is without conflicts. We assume that each local knowledge base is managed by one resource agent. In this paper, we use the definition of an agent that was introduced by Pawlak in Pawlak (1984).

In the definition of an agent’s decision tables, we do not assume that the sets of conditional attributes are disjoint. Moreover, we do not assume that the universes of the decision tables of different resource agents are disjoint or equal. Thus, both the sets of conditional attributes and the universe can be defined in any way. The only condition that must be satisfied is the occurrence of the same decision attributes in all of the decision tables of the agents. With such a general assumption, a combination of agents’ decision tables in a coherent table, using a simple transformation, is a difficult, if not impossible, issue to resolve.

Such a general assumption has been adopted because we want to investigate situations that are similar to the real applications that were described in the introduction. In the example that is given, we analyze four medical centers, each of which has its own diagnostic methods and stores its own knowledge base. Of course, some conditional attributes such as cholesterol or echocardiograms are shared. However, there are pairs of medical centers that have disjoint sets of conditional attributes, such as the second and the fourth medical center or the third and the fourth medical center. In addition, certain objects can be shared by selected medical centers, but not necessarily all of them. Therefore, as was mentioned, we cannot assume that the sets of conditional attributes and the universes are disjoint or equal, because then the system will not cover all of the real situations. Often, a certain number of conditional attributes will be shared for some group of knowledge bases, but not necessarily all of them. It is not possible to determine the general structure that we will have to deal with more precisely, but in the decision-making process that was investigated, it was expected that some of the conditional attributes are shared.

In this part of the paper definitions of the relations between agents are given. The clustering process is then discussed and the definition of a dispersed decision-making system will be presented.

In the proposed approach three types of relations are used: a relation of friendship, a relation of conflict and a relation of neutrality. The definitions of these relations, as well as a method for determining the intensity of the conflict are given in the paper Przybyła-Kasperek and Wakulicz-Deja (2014a). We will now briefly discuss a definition of the relations.

To determine the relations between resource agents, we must first determine the classification of the test object that is being carried out by the agents. Decisions on the classification of the test object that are made by the agents will be determined on the basis of certain relevant objects, i.e. the objects from the decision tables of the agents that carry the greatest similarity to the test object. The user determines the size of the set of relevant objects by choosing the value of parameter m
                        1. Relevant objects is the smallest set containing at least m
                        1 objects for which the values of the conditional attributes bear the greatest similarity to the test object x. A measure of similarity between the objects is used in order to determine the set of relevant objects. Choosing the appropriate measure is very important and it should be based on the space to which the objects from decision tables belong.

                         we denote the set of relevant objects that are selected from the decision table of resource agent ag.

In the next stage, the vector that indicates the level of certainty with which the decisions are taken by the agent for the test object is generated for each resource agent. Each coordinate of the vector is determined on the basis of the relevant objects that were previously selected from the decision table of the resource agent. Thus, for each resource agent

On the basis of the vector of values defined above, which specifies the level of certainty with which decisions for the test object are taken by a given resource agent, a vector of the rank assigned to the values of the decision attribute is specified. The vector of rank is defined as follows: Rank 1 is assigned to the values of the decision attribute that are taken with the maximum level of certainty. Rank 2 is assigned to the next most certain decisions, etc. Proceeding in this way, the vector of rank

In the above definition, a generic value that defines the relations was used; we mean q that belongs to the interval (0, 1). But in this paper, the fixed value of 
                           
                              q
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                         was adopted. This value can be mapped to the absolute majority (50 percent). Of course other types of majority can be used. It is planned to investigate such an approach in a future work. In this paper we examine the impact of parameter p ∈ [0, 0.5) on the structure of dynamically generated clusters.

By using the relations defined above we can create groups of resource agents. The approach used in the paper involves a two-step process of creating a coalition. In the first stage, we create a group of agents that are in a strong and good relationships, so agents that remain in a friendship relation. In this way we get groups of agents in friendship and a group of unconnected agents. In the second step the negotiation issues are applied and agents that are neutral are joined to an existing coalition. The second stage is carried out as follows. We calculate joint decisions for the groups created in the first step. Then we verify whether the neutral agents are compatible enough with the decisions of the group to join to the group. In this way we obtain the final coalitions of agents. The process of creating coalitions is described below.

The first step in the process of creating clusters is to define the initial group of agents that remain in a friendship relation.

Let Ag be the set of resource agents. The initial cluster due to the classification of object x is the maximum, due to the inclusion relation, subset of resource agents X ⊆ Ag such that

                        Thus, the initial cluster is the maximum, due to inclusion relation, set of resource agents that remain in the friendship relation due to the object x.

After the first stage of creating clusters, we obtain a set of initial clusters and a set of agents that are not included in any cluster. For each agent that is not attached to any cluster, the relations between this agent and the initial clusters and other agents that are without a coalition are analyzed. In the second stage, agents without a coalition are connected to each initial cluster with whom its relations are good enough. In addition, new clusters that consist of agents without a coalition and that are in sufficiently good relations are created. In the second stage of clustering process, a generalized distance function between agents is defined. This definition assumes that during the negotiation, agents put the greatest emphasis on the compatibility of the ranks that were assigned to the decisions with the highest ranks, i.e. is the values of the decisions that are the most significant for the agent. The compatibility of the ranks that were assigned to the less meaningful decision is omitted during the second stage of the clustering process.

It can also be a decision, which has the rank 1, 2 or 3. The definition will depend on the system’s user. In the experiments presented in the penultimate section of this paper, the approach in which only the decisions that have the rank 1 are taken into account when calculating the value of the

During the second stage of the cluster creating process, the negotiation process, the intensity of the conflict between the two groups of agents is determined by using the generalized distance. We define the generalized distance between agents

                                 0(ag, ag′).

Then agent ag is included into all of the initial clusters for which the generalized distance does not exceed a certain threshold that is set by the system’s user. In addition, agents without a coalition for whom the value of the generalized distance function does not exceed the threshold are combined into a new cluster.

After completion of the second stage of the process of clustering, i.e. the joining of agents without a coalition to the initial cluster with which its relations are good enough, we get the final form of clusters. The proposed decision-making system has a hierarchical structure. The resource agents that are connected into clusters are located at the lowest level of the hierarchy.

For each cluster that contains at least two resource agents, a superordinate agent is defined, which is called a synthesis agent, agsj
                        , where j-number of cluster. The synthesis agent, agsj
                        , has access to knowledge that is the result of the process of inference that is carried out by the resource agents that belong to its subordinate group. Ags is a finite set of synthesis agents.

Now, we can provide a formal definition of a dispersed decision-making system.

                              : ag ∈ Ag} is a set of the decision tables of the resource agents; Agsx
                               is a finite set of synthesis agents that is defined for the clusters that are dynamically generated for object x, δx
                              : Agsx

                               is an injective function that each synthesis agent assigns to the cluster that is generated due to classification of object x.

Note that the set of function values δx
                         is the set of all of the clusters due to the classification of object x, which is generated in the two-stage process in accordance with the description given above.

In order to reach a joint decision, after creating the cluster of resource agents, the common knowledge for each cluster is generated. This process is not very simple and obvious because inconsistencies of knowledge may occur within the clusters. This problem stems from the fact that there are no assumptions about the relation between the sets of the conditional attributes of different resource agents in the system. We understand an inconsistency of knowledge to be a situation in which conflicting decisions are made on the basis of two different decision tables that have common conditional attributes and for the same values for the common attributes using logical implications. The process of creating aggregated knowledge within one cluster was named as the process for the elimination of inconsistencies in the knowledge and was discussed in the papers Wakulicz-Deja and Przybyła-Kasperek (2010) and Wakulicz-Deja and Przybyła-Kasperek (2011). In this paper, the approximated method for the aggregation of decision tables is used. This method consists in constructing new objects that are based on the relevant objects from the decision tables of the resource agents that belong to one cluster. In order to define the relevant objects, the smallest set that contains at least m
                     2 objects for which the value of the conditional attributes bears the greatest similarity to the test object from the decision table of a resource agent is chosen. The aggregated objects are created by combining only those relevant objects for which the values of the decision attribute and common conditional attributes are equal. A formal definition of the aggregated tables of synthesis agents is given below. A detailed discussion of the approximated method for the aggregation of decision tables can be found in the paper Wakulicz-Deja and Przybyła-Kasperek (2010).

After the completion of the process of the elimination of the inconsistencies in the knowledge, the synthesis agents have access to the knowledge on the basis of which they can independently establish the value of a local decision to just one cluster. However, we still do not have a common decision for all of the agents. When determining a joint decision conflicts may occur. Conflicts between agents are understood as situations in which the synthesis agents take contradictory decisions for a given set of conditions that are based on the available knowledge. Two methods for resolving the conflict analysis will be used in this paper—the method of weighted voting and the method that uses a density-based algorithm. These methods have been proposed in the earlier papers Wakulicz-Deja and Przybyła-Kasperek (2010) and Wakulicz-Deja and Przybyła-Kasperek (2011) and are briefly described below. But first we will discuss an issue that is related to the method for determining the strength of a cluster.

                      is taken by the agents that belong to the cluster j for a given test object x. The vector of the values that are assigned to the cluster is defined as follows. The value μ
                     
                        j, i
                     (x) is equal to the maximum value of the similarity measure of the objects from the decision class vi
                      of the decision table of synthesis agent agsj
                      to the test object x. These vectors are normalized, which means that they are transformed in such a way that the sum of the vector’s coefficients will be equal to one. Thus, the vector that is assigned to the jth cluster is multiplied by the scalar

In the earlier papers, these vectors of values and the conflict analysis method were used to generate global decisions. This approach has drawbacks because both small and large coalitions have the same impact on the global decisions that are generated. In this paper, a modification of the method for calculating the vectors that are assigned to the clusters is proposed. This modification consists in taking into account the strength of a cluster. We propose several methods for determining the strength of a cluster. These methods are described below.

                              Method 1—cluster strength
                           

In this method the strength of a cluster is calculated with respect to the number of component agents. In the proposed method for creating a system’s structure, inseparable clusters are generated. Thus, one agent may be included in many clusters. This means that the partial participation of the agent in the creation of the cluster should be considered. Thus, in the first stage of the process of determining the strength of cluster, the membership of each agent in the clusters is calculated. For each resource agent ag ∈ Ag and the given test object x, a coefficient of the agent’s membership in clusters is defined

If the values of the vector coordinates are nearly equal, it means that the agent is not set on one decision value, but evaluates the possibility to assign a test object to all decision classes almost equally. The knowledge that is provided by the agent is of little value. However, if the values of the vector coordinates are highly varied, it means that the agent is confident in the classification of the object to one decision class. This knowledge is much more valuable. In the proposed approach, the diversity of the vector

                              is determined and the vector that is assigned to jth cluster is multiplied by this value. In this way, the vectors are recalculated in proportion to the decisiveness of the resource agents. Thanks to such transformation, the agents that make decisions with the same degree of certainty have less impact on the global decisions, while the impact of agents that are sure of the decisions that have been taken increases.

In this method the strength of a cluster is calculated with respect to the number of component agents and the diversity of the decisions that are taken by resource agents. This approach is a combination of the two approaches presented above. For each resource agent, a factor

In this method the strength of a cluster is calculated with respect to the diversity of the decisions that are taken by synthesis agents. Analogously to the second proposed approach, the diversity of the vectors that determine local decisions within a cluster can be calculated; this is the diversity of the vector [μ

                              Then for each synthesis agent the vector assigned to jth cluster is multiplied by this value. In this way the vectors are recalculated in proportion to the decisiveness of the synthesis agents. Thanks to such a transformation, the groups of agents (clusters) that make decisions with the same degree of certainty have less impact on the global decisions, while the impact of the groups of agents that are sure of the decisions they have been taken increases.

These four proposed approaches were used in combination with the methods of conflict analysis. As was mentioned earlier, two methods for resolving conflicts are used—the method of weighted voting and the method that uses a density-based algorithm. In the method of weighted voting, each synthesis agent votes for different values of the decision with a voting power that is equal to the value of the coordinate of the vector that corresponds to a given decision. The set of global decisions that is generated using the method of weighted voting is defined by selecting the decisions that are taken with the maximum level of certainty. Thus, the set of global decisions that are generated using the method of weighted voting is defined as follows:

The method of weighted voting is one of the most popular methods of conflict analysis, although the use of a density-based algorithm in the method of conflict analysis is not so obvious and requires a justification. Let us first analyze a situation in which we want to use this method. After applying the methods to determine the strength of the clusters, we receive one c-dimensional vector of values. In this vector, a value that reflects the “aggregate” certainty with which all agents classify the test object to the decision class, is assigned to each decision. The simplest approach for choosing the decision that could be applied is to select a decision to which the maximum value of the vector’s coefficient is assigned. However, our goal is to select a set of decisions that not only contains the decision with the maximum support, but also those for which the support is relatively high. Therefore, we would like to select decisions that have the maximum value of the vector’s coefficient and those whose support is close to the maximum. However, the expression ,,close to the maximum” is not strictly defined because it could mean something else for each data set. This problem can be solved by using a clustering algorithm. Let each vector’s coefficient be a separate point. A set of decisions that are densely situated around the point with the maximum value can be selected. For this purpose, a clustering algorithm will be used. As is known from the literature (Han, Kamber, & Pei, 2012; Jain, Murty, & Flynn, 1999), we can distinguish the following methods of cluster analysis: partitioning methods (k-Means, k-Medoids), hierarchical methods (agglomerative and divisive hierarchical clustering), grid-based methods (STING, CLIQUE) and density-based methods (DBSCAN, OPTICS). Partitioning methods use an iterative relocation technique that attempts to improve the partitioning by moving objects from one group to another. Since in the case being considered, the goal is to determine one group around the point with the maximum coefficient’s value, they are not appropriate methods. Hierarchical clustering methods work by grouping data objects into a hierarchy or “tree” of clusters. A dendrogram representing data objects in the form of a hierarchy is created. This can be used for data summarization and visualization. It is also not an appropriate method in the case that is under consideration. Grid-based clustering methods quantify an objects space into a finite number of cells that form a grid structure on which all of the operations for clustering are performed. This is not a very useful approach in the case of a small set of objects. Thus, the most suitable method for the problem being considered is a method from the density-based group.

As was mentioned earlier, in the case of the method that uses a density-based algorithm, the set that is generated will contain not only the value of the decisions that have the greatest support of the knowledge that is stored in the local knowledge bases, but also those for which the support is relatively high. The algorithm DBSCAN (Ester, Kriegel, Sander, & Xu, 1996) from the literature was used in the method that uses a density-based algorithm. A density-based algorithm searches for densely situated points. The main idea of this method is the assumption the following condition must be fulfilled that for each point that belongs to a cluster in the ε-neighborhood there is a minimum number of points (MinPts) that have been defined in advance. In this way, elements that are densely situated in a given sense (specified by parameters) are searched. The definition of a cluster in the DBSCAN algorithm is based on objects that are directly density-reachable as well as density-connected objects. In the situation that is discussed in this paper, a set of elements that is grouped is the set of decision classes Vd
                      and the distance between two values of the decision is dependent on the level of certainty with which the decision is made. Using the DBSCAN algorithm with the Euclidean distance, we can determine the group of decisions that have similar support among the synthesis agents. When groups of decision values are established, i.e. decisions that have similar support of the synthesis agents, the cluster to which the decision that has the biggest support of all of the synthesis agents is chosen and it is interpreted as the set of global decisions that have been taken by the dispersed decision-making system

                      for the test object x. A detailed discussion of the method that uses a density-based algorithm can be found in Wakulicz-Deja and Przybyła-Kasperek (2010) and Wakulicz-Deja and Przybyła-Kasperek (2011).

The DBSCAN algorithm is not a standard method for group decision making. The most common and simplest methods of aggregation rules are, for example, the simple majority rule, the majority with a veto rule or weighted voting. Using the DBSCAN algorithm has an important advantage over these standard methods. In the set of global decisions that is generated not only are those decisions that received the maximum number of votes included because the density-based algorithm in the set also means that the decisions that received the number of votes that is very close to the maximum number are included. Therefore, this method often provides a significant improvement in the efficiency of inference at the expense of a slight increase in the cardinality of the global decisions set that is generated and therefore its use is justified for data sets that have a large number of decision values (a dozen or more decision classes). In such a case, if we get the result in the form of two classes for some objects, it can still be seen as a pretty good result. Such a situation occurs, for example, in the case of one of the data sets that is investigated in Section 6. There are 19 decision classes in this data set and a system that has a high degree of accuracy can generate a set of decisions that has an average cardinality equal to 1.5. As was mentioned earlier, this is still a very desirable outcome.

For this paper, the weighted voting method was also used during the process of optimizing the system parameters. However, the results that were obtained were far worse than those that were generated using the DBSCAN algorithm. Section 6.2.1 also provides a brief analysis of the results that were obtained using the simple majority rule, for which worse results were obtained once again.

The examples that are given in this section and in Appendix B show the process of creating clusters and the differences in the decisions that are taken using the different methods for calculating the strength of clusters. Consider a dispersed decision-making system in which the set of agents consists of seven resource agents

                      For the sake of simplicity, we assume that there are only qualitative conditional attributes in these tables. These tables have not been generated from a single table, we assume that they were accumulated separately in different centers. Therefore, as was mentioned earlier, the tables have different sets of objects and attributes. The objects that are relevant to test object x are selected from the decision tables of the agents. Test object x is described in Table 1
                     .

At first, the process of determining the relations of friendship, conflict and neutrality between agents is realized. The relevant objects are given in Table 2
                     ; the values of the Gower similarity measure (the definition is given in Appendix A) of the objects that are relevant to the test object are also given in this table. The vectors

                      were designated based on the similarity values. These vectors are shown in Table 3. In this table, the standard deviations calculated after the vectors transformation, which aim is that the sum of the vectors coefficients is equal to 1, were also given. These values will be needed later in the example.

The value of the function of the distance between agents is calculated for each pair of resource agents on the basis of the vectors of rank according to Formula (3). These values are given in Table 4 and are presented in the upper triangular matrix.

Then, the process of creating clusters is implemented. In the considered approach to creating a system’s structure, a two-stage process of generating clusters is used. The initial clusters are formed according to Formula (4) in the first stage in which the resource agents that remain in a friendship relation are connected. Assume that the p that appears in the definition of friendship relation 3.3 is equal to 
                        
                           p
                           =
                           0.1
                        
                     . Then a pair of agents ag, ag′ ∈ Ag for which the condition ρx
                     (ag, ag′) < 0.4 is fulfilled are in a friendship relation. This condition is fulfilled for only one pair of agents (ag
                     3, ag
                     6). Thus, in the first stage of the process of generating clusters only one initial cluster {ag
                     3, ag
                     6} is generated. In the second stage of the clustering process, the initial clusters are expanded by adding agents that are in a neutrality relation and new clusters that consist of agents that have not been included in any initial clusters are formed. In the first step of this stage for each agent that has not been included in any initial clusters, the value of function 
                        
                           ϕ

                      (Formula (5)) and the value of generalized distance function (Formula (6)) are calculated for each initial cluster and for each agent without a coalition with which the agent is not in a conflict relation. According to the adopted value of the parameter 
                        
                           p
                           =

                      was drawn in order to better illustrate the situation that is being considered. The figure shows a graphical representation of the neutrality relations in which the agents are. Agents and initial clusters are represented by circles in the figure. When a pair of agents is in a neutrality relation, the circles representing the agents are linked.

In order to find potential clusters, all cliques should be identified in the graph. So the subset of vertices such that every two vertices are adjacent is determined. Then, for each of cliques the function value

In the paper Przybyła-Kasperek and Wakulicz-Deja (2014a) the formula for calculation of the threshold value was proposed

Then, the process of the elimination of the inconsistencies in the knowledge is carried out. The knowledge for each cluster is generated. This is carried out using the approximated method for the aggregation of decision tables. An aggregated decision table is generated for each synthesis agent based on the relevant object of the resource agents from one cluster (given in Table 2). The aggregated decision table is defined in Definition 4.1. The decision tables of the synthesis agents are given in Table 7
                     ; the values of the Gower similarity measure to the test object are also given in this table. As was mentioned earlier, the aggregated objects are created by combining only those relevant objects for which the values of the decision attribute and common conditional attributes are equal. For example, consider the aggregated table of synthesis agent ags
                     1, which is a superordinate agent to the cluster {ag
                     1, ag
                     4}. The first object that belongs to the set

                              A

                                 x
                              
                              }

                      were designated based on the similarity values that are given in Table 7. These vectors are shown in Table 8
                     . The standard deviations are also given in this table, but these values were calculated after the transformation of the vectors, the aim of which was to obtain a sum of the vectors coefficients that was equal to 1. The values of the weights of the clusters, which were calculated according to proposed methods and Formulas (8), (10), (11), and (13), are given in Table 9
                     . In Method 1 and Method 3, the coefficient of an agent’s membership in clusters (Formula (7)) was used. Each agent belongs to two clusters, and therefore this coefficient is equal to 0.5 for all of the resource agents. In Method 2 and Method 3, the standard deviations of the vectors of the resource agents (Formula (9)) were applied. These values are given in Table 3. In Method 4, the standard deviations of the vectors of the synthesis agents (Formula (12)) were used. These values are given in Table 8. Based on the values that are presented in Table 9, it can be concluded that almost all of the proposed methods for calculating the strength of clusters generates a different order of the validity of the clusters. This is because different aspects are taken into account during the calculation. Only Method 2 and Method 3, in this particular example, are equivalent. This is due to the fact that each resource agent has the same value of the coefficient of the agent’s membership in clusters. However, it should be noted that, in general, this does not happen frequently.

The sums of the vectors that were assigned to the clusters, which were obtained by including the various methods for calculating the strength of clusters, are given in Table 10
                     . In this table, the rank that is assigned to the decision values that are based on these vectors are also presented.

As can be seen, the ranks that were assigned to the decisions changed completely when Method 1 was applied. This example shows the influence of the weights of the clusters as expressed by the number of component agents on the decisions that were taken. Other methods for determining weights do not have as much impact on the decisions. This is due to the fact that in the example that was investigated, there were no very large differences between the standard deviations in the vectors that were assigned to the agents.

In order to demonstrate the influence of the other method, we investigated another example, which are presented in Appendix B. These two examples show that the methods that are used to calculate the weights of clusters examine different aspects of decision-making. Although only the impact of the first two methods is presented in detail (Method 1 in the above example and Method 2 in Appendix B), it is easy to justify other methods. An example in which Method 3 will have a noticeable impact on decisions would be a situation in which the agents are unequally placed in clusters. Such an example may be the set of clusters {ag
                     1, ag
                     2}, {ag
                     2, ag
                     3}, {ag
                     3, ag
                     4, ag
                     5, ag
                     6, ag
                     7}, where the last cluster is much more powerful than the others. Method 4 will change the decisions that are taken if the standard deviations of the vectors that are assigned to the clusters would be extremely varied.

In conclusion, clusters of different sizes and structures are generated during group decision making. These aspects should be taken into account when making global decisions. Otherwise, two clusters with significantly different sizes, or ones that contain agents that have differences in the reliability of the decisions that are taken, will have the same voting power when making global decisions, which is neither desirable nor expected.

The results of the experiments that were performed on three different data sets are presented below. The main purpose of these tests was to investigate how particular methods for determining the strength of clusters affects the efficiency of a system’s inference. For this purpose, the four approaches for determining the strength of a cluster that are presented in this paper and an approach without the strength of a cluster (proposed in the paper Przybyła-Kasperek & Wakulicz-Deja (2014a)) were compared.

The following data, which are in the UCI repository, were used for the experiments:

                           
                              •
                              Soybean data set, which concerns the analysis of the external characteristics of soybeans in order to diagnose the pathogens that affect any impairments in the processes of plant life

Vehicle Silhouettes data set from the project “StatLog”, which concerns vehicle type recognition based on a set of features that describe the figure

Landsat Satellite data set from the project “StatLog”, which concerns the identification of satellite images.

In order to determine the efficiency of the inference of the dispersed decision-making system with respect to the data that was being analyzed, each data set was divided into two disjoint subsets—a training set and a test set. The test sets for the Soybean and Landsat Satellite data were obtained from the UCI repository. The Vehicle Silhouettes data set was randomly divided into a training set consisting of 70 percent of the objects and the test set consisting of the remaining 30 percent of the objects.

                         presents a numerical summary of the data sets.

The proposed dispersed decision-making system allows global decisions to be made on the basis of the dispersed knowledge that is stored in several decision tables. To fully explore the possibilities and to evaluate the efficiency of the inference of the dispersed decision-making system, it is necessary to provide the knowledge that is stored in the form of a set of decision tables. Therefore, each of the training sets was divided into a set of decision tables. Divisions with a different number of decision tables were considered. A dispersed decision-making system with five different versions (with 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 resource agents) was analyzed for each of the data sets that were used. For these systems, we used the following designations:

As was mentioned earlier, any similarity measures can be applied in the proposed system. Since the data sets that were examined in the experiments have qualitative, quantitative and binary attributes, the Gower similarity measure, which enables the analysis of such data, is used. The definition of this measure is given in Appendix A.

The measures for determining the quality of the classifications were:

                           
                              •
                              
                                 estimator of classification error e in which an object is considered to be properly classified if the decision class that is used for the object belonged to the set of global decisions that were generated by the system;


                                 estimator of classification ambiguity error eONE
                                  in which an object is considered to be properly classified if only one correct value of the decision was generated for this object;

                                  that was generated for a test set.

In the description of the results of the experiments some designations for algorithms have been adopted for the sake of clarity:

                           
                              •
                              
                                 A(m
                                 2) —the approximated method for the aggregation of decision tables;


                                 W —the method of weighted voting;


                                 G(ε, MinPts) —the method that uses a density-based algorithm.

Several parameters are
                        
                        
                        
                         found in a dispersed decision-making system. The role and the influence of the parameters on the results that are generated by the system using the example of one data set (Soybean) are discussed in Appendix C.

The optimal parameter values should be determined by the system’s user. In order to do this, some preliminary tests should be performed. The process of the optimization of the parameters was carried out as follows. In the first stage, the optimal values of parameters m
                        1 and m
                        2 were determined for different values of parameter p. This is done by performing tests for different parameter values: p ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.2}; for small and medium data sets

                         tests with different values of the parameters m
                        1 and m
                        2 were carried out. In total, 100 results for small and medium data sets (25 results for large data set) for 
                           
                              p

                         will be obtained. The execution time of these tests is not very long and usually lasts only a few minutes up to ten minutes. Then, the minimum value of the parameters m
                        1 and m
                        2 are chosen, which results in the lowest value of the estimator of the classification error on a test set to be reached. Analogous tests should be conducted for 
                           
                              p

                         and

                        . In the second step parameters ε and MinPts are optimized. This is realized by using the optimal parameter values that were determined in the previous step. As was mentioned in Appendix C, parameter MinPts is equal to 2, and parameter ε is optimized by performing a series of experiments with different values of this parameter. Then, a graph that is similar to Fig. C.4 is created and the points that indicate the greatest improvement in the efficiency of inference are marked on the graphs. In the next sections, the best results that were obtained for the optimal values of the parameter p, m
                        1, m
                        2, MinPts and ε are presented.

At the beginning of this section, the process of selecting the optimal parameter values will be presented. We will analyze this process using the example of the dispersed system with nine resource agents and Method 1. As was described above three different values of parameter p: 
                              
                                 p

                            were analyzed. According to the plan of the experiments, tests began with the optimization of parameters m
                           1 for each value of parameter p, which has an influence on the form of the clusters and with the optimization of parameter m
                           2 of the approximated method for the aggregation of decision tables. For this purpose, a dispersed decision-making system with dynamically generated inseparable clusters, the algorithm A(m
                           2)W and Method 1 for calculating agents weights were used. Values

                            were examined. The optimal value of parameters m

                           2 is the smallest value for which the minimum of the estimator of the classification error is reached.

For the other data sets and dispersed systems, the parameter optimization process proceeded in the same way as it did for the Soybean data set with nine resource agents that was described above. A detailed description of the parameter optimization process will be omitted and we will move on to present the results of experiments.

The results of the experiments for the Soybean data set are presented in Tables 13–17. The tables show the results for five different approaches:

                            results for the Soybean data set that is presented in Tables 13–17—the best results were obtained four times when the two approaches with the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the number of component agents (Method 1) and with the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the diversity of the decisions that were taken by the resource agents (Method 2) were used. The best results were obtained twice when the approach that is a combination of the above two approaches (Method 3) was used. Considering the average values of the estimator of classification error e, it can be concluded that the best efficiency of inference was obtained using the approaches—the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the diversity of the decisions that were taken by the resource agents (Method 2), the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the number of component agents (Method 1) and the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the number of component agents and the diversity of the decisions that were taken by the resource agents (Method 3).

A brief analysis of results of the Soybean data set that were obtained using one of the standard methods of voting,—the simple majority rule, was conducted. In Table 18 the results are presented for the dispersed system that is discussed in this paper in which the simple majority rule is used instead of the DBSCAN algorithm. Based on these results it can be concluded that significantly worse results were obtained using this method compared to the results that are shown in Tables 13–17, which were obtained using the DBSCAN algorithm and the proposed method for calculating the weights of the agents. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the remaining data sets that were investigated. Therefore, the simple majority rule method was not considered in the following part of the paper.

The results of the experiments with a dispersed decision-making system with dynamically generated inseparable clusters and a negotiation process are presented in Tables 19–23. These tables are organized in the same way as the ones for the Soybean data set.

Summarizing the results for the Vehicle Silhouettes data set that is presented in Tables 19–23 the best results were obtained five times using the approach with the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the number of component agents and the diversity of the decisions that were taken by the resource agents (Method 3). The best results were obtained twice using the approach with the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the diversity of the decisions that were taken by the resource agents (Method 2). Considering the average values of the estimator of the classification error e, it can be concluded that the best efficiency of inference was achieved using the approach in which the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the number of component agents and the diversity of the decisions that were taken by the resource agents (Method 3), the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the diversity of the decisions that were taken by the resource agents (Method 2) and the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the number of component agents (Method 1).

The results of the experiments with a dispersed decision-making system with dynamically generated inseparable clusters and a negotiation process are presented in Tables 24–28. These tables are organized in the same way as the ones for the Soybean data set.

Summarizing the results for the Landsat Satellite data set that is presented in Tables 24–28 the best results were obtained four times using the two approaches with the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the number of component agents (Method 1) and with the strength of a cluster that was calculated with respect to the diversity of the decisions that were taken by the synthesis agents (Method 4). Considering the average values of the estimator of the classification error e, we cannot say that one of the approaches is significantly better than the others.

We will now proceed to a more in-depth analysis and comparison of the results. Table 29 summarizes the number of the best results that were obtained for the different methods and data sets.

Based on the sums that are presented in the last row of Table 29, it can be concluded that the best results were obtained for Method 1 and Method 3. However, the proportions for particular data sets are arranged differently. In order to perform a more detailed examination of the causes of the obtained results, the structure of the clusters that were generated was analyzed. A comparison of the different measurements that were used to determine the structure of the clusters is presented in Tables 30
                         and 31
                        . All of the measures that were used are defined in Appendix D. The parameters, which were selected in the previous experiments and were presented in Tables 13–28, are used for the results in this table. The following information is given in the tables:

                           
                              •
                              the name of the data set (Data set)

the name of the dispersed decision-making system that is using dynamically generated clusters (System)

the approach that was used to calculate the strength the clusters: Method 1, Method 2, Method 3 and Method 4

in Table 30 the measures that were used to determine the number of clusters: AvgC
                                 —the average number of clusters, SDC
                                 —standard deviation of the number of clusters, CVC
                                 —coefficient of variation of the number of clusters

in Table 31 the measures that were used to determine the number of agents in the clusters: AvgA
                                 —average number of agents in the clusters, SDA
                                 —standard deviation of the number of agents in the clusters, CVA
                                 —coefficient of variation of the number of agents in the clusters, 
                                    
                                       r
                                       ¯
                                    
                                 —average number of times when one agent was included in many clusters

Based on the results that are shown in Tables 30 and 31, the following conclusions can be drawn. On average, a similar number of clusters is generated for each data set (Soybean—4.8, Vehicle—4.031, Satellite—4.728). Obviously, the more agents that there are in a dispersed system, the more clusters that are generated. A more important analysis can be made based on the information that is presented in Table 31. It was noted that the average number of agents in clusters was the smallest and the average variation in the number of agents in clusters was the highest for the Soybean data set. Moreover, a small number of agents that were simultaneously included in many clusters was noted. After a thorough analysis of the results, it was found that there was a group of objects in the test set for which clusters with a very irregular number of agents were generated. This particular group of objects caused the high variation. In such a situation, Method 1 generated very good results. This method reflected the variation in the number of agents in the clusters when making decisions very well. Another good approach is Method 2, which reduced the influence of undecided resource agents on the decisions that were taken. The average number of agents in the clusters was the largest for the Vehicle Silhouettes data set. However, it had the smallest variation of the number of agents in the clusters. After a careful study of the results that were obtained for the test set, it was noticed that the frequency distribution of the agents in the clusters was similar for all objects. In such a situation, Method 1 was not very good. It would have been better to use a method that reduces the influence of undecided resource agents on the decisions that were taken; these are Method 2 and Method 3. The number of agents in the clusters and the variation were quite large for the Landsat Satellite data set. However, what was most noteworthy was that the number of agents that were simultaneously included in many clusters was the highest. In this situation, Method 1 had good results because it took into account the partial participation of the agents in the clusters. Method 4 was also found to be good for this data set. This method reduces the impact of undecided synthesis agents on the decisions that are taken. Table 32
                         presents a summary of general guidance on using the proposed methods in practice.

Four different methods for determining the weights of coalitions during the global decision-making process were proposed. In each of the approaches different aspects were investigated when calculating the weights. It appears that the approaches should be applied in different situations and it seems to be possible to use more than one approach in the same session. Initially, several approaches could be used simultaneously to generate the sets of global decisions, then the sum or the intersection of these sets can be calculated. A set that is defined in this way would be the result generated by the system. It is planned to investigate such an approach in a future work.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, an approach to the organization of the structure of a dispersed decision-making system that was proposed in the paper Przybyła-Kasperek and Wakulicz-Deja (2014a) was used. The novelty that is proposed in this article involves the use of four new methods for determining the strength of a cluster. These new approaches have been proposed because although a quite sophisticated, two-stage clustering method was applied in the previous paper, the strength of the clusters that were created were not taken into account in the process of global decision-making. Although this two-step clustering method permits the views of the agents on the classification to be better reconstructed and illustrated, this aspect was not fully used and was not reflected in the results that were presented in the previous paper. In the new proposed approach, the method for the analysis of conflicts in the decisions that are made by a group of agents (clusters) not only depend on the similarity of objects from the aggregated tables to the test object but also on the strength of clusters. The strength of the clusters is expressed in four different ways:

                        
                           •
                           calculated with respect to the number of component agents,

calculated with respect to the diversity of the decisions that are taken by the resource agents,

calculated with respect to the number of component agents and the diversity of the decisions that are taken by the resource agents,

calculated with respect to the diversity of the decisions that are taken by the synthesis agents.

Based on the example that presented in Section 5, it was shown that the proposed methods for calculating the weights of the clusters examine different aspects of decision-making and generate different results. Based on the experiments that are presented, we can say that the first three methods give the best results. These results are much better than in the case in which the strength of the clusters is not calculated. Based on the experiments, some conclusions were drawn and Table 32 provides general guidance on the use of the proposed methods in practice.
