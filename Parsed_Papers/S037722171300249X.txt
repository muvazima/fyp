                  In this paper, we propose an efficient technique for linearizing facility location problems with site-dependent failure probabilities, focusing on the unreliable p-median problem. Our approach is based on the use of a specialized flow network, which we refer to as a probability chain, to evaluate compound probability terms. The resulting linear model is compact in size. The method can be employed in a straightforward way to linearize similarly structured problems, such as the maximum expected covering problem. We further discuss how probability chains can be extended to problems with co-location and other, more general problem classes. Additional lower bounds as well as valid inequalities for use within a branch and cut algorithm are introduced to significantly speed up overall solution time. Computational results are presented for several test problems showing the efficiency of our linear model in comparison to existing problem formulations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper, we consider the optimal location of unreliable facilities in a network. We propose a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the unreliable p-median problem (Drezner, 1987; Berman et al., 2007). The objective of the model is to locate p facilities, any number of which may fail independently, so as to minimize the expected demand-weighted distance between customers and their closest operational facilities. A system-wide penalty is incurred if all facilities fail. In the general case, which we focus on here, facility failure probabilities are site-dependent.

Our interest in such problems stems from the recognized need to design more robust service and supply networks that are resilient to the ill effects of random, short- to medium-term facility disruptions (Craighead et al., 2007). In practice, there are a wide variety of reasons why facilities can and do fail – common ones being equipment breakdowns, power outages, industrial accidents (e.g., fires), large natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes and hurricanes), disease outbreaks, work stoppages (i.e., labor strikes), and even malicious sabotage or attack (e.g., by terrorists). The effects of facility failures can sometimes be significant, resulting in major disruption to normal operations with high associated costs.

A well documented example is the fire in 2000 at the Philips microchip factory in Albuquerque, New Mexico (Latour, 2001). The fire, which destroyed millions of chips used in the manufacture of mobile phones, had a significant impact on Nokia and, in particular, its competitor Ericsson, which were both supplied by the Philips factory. Short-term revenue losses for Ericsson were at least $400million. The long-term impact on Ericsson was even greater, ultimately contributing to an annual operating loss of $1.68billion.

Other notable examples include the Tohoku–Kanto Earthquake and Tsunami that struck northeast Japan in 2011, causing an estimated $195–$305billion in physical damage alone (Nanto et al., 2011) to say nothing of the enormous human toll and longer-term economic impacts due to the ensuing nuclear crisis, electricity shortages, reduce manufacturing capacity and impairments to regional infrastructure; Hurricane Katrina, which hit the US Gulf Coast in 2005, causing major disruption to national oil and gas production (Cashell and Labonte, 2005); the SARS disease outbreak of 2003, which shutdown hospitals in Toronto, Canada (Berman et al., 2007); and the 2002 longshoremen’s strike along the US West Coast, which had a crippling effect on domestic and international shipping, costing an estimated $15.6billion to the US economy (Martin Associates, 2003).

Hardening existing facilities can be an effective way of minimizing the risks associated with facility disruption (Scaparra and Church, 2008; Liberatore et al., 2011; Liberatore et al., 2012; Losada et al., 2012b). An alternative and oftentimes more robust approach is to find good initial location strategies. In this paper, we focus on the latter and restrict attention to random facility disruption as opposed to worst-case scenarios in which an interdiction type framework is commonly employed (e.g., O’Hanley and Church, 2011).

Within the OR and location science literature, investigation into systematic methods for designing reliable facility networks goes back several decades. For the classical p-median problem (Hakimi, 1965) and related problems like the uncapacitated fixed-charge location problem (UFLP), a number of different models and solution approaches have been proposed.


                     Drezner (1987) developed a heuristic to account for multiple, random facility disruptions in a p-median network when the probability of disruption is equal for all facilities. Snyder and Daskin (2005) use Lagrangian decomposition to optimally locate equally unreliable facilities for both the p-median problem and UFLP. Lim et al. (2010) extend work on the UFLP by considering the location of both reliable and unreliable facilities, which naturally differ in terms of cost.


                     Berman et al. (2007) build upon Drezner (1987) and Snyder and Daskin (2005) by formulating an implicit nonlinear integer programming model of the unreliable p-median problem that allows for heterogeneous facility failure probabilities. The authors go onto explore key structural and asymptotic results of their model, focusing specifically on co-location effects associated with increasing failure probabilities, as well as the development of an efficient heuristic solution method with a proven worst-case error bound.

Similarly, Cui et al. (2010) relax the assumption of equal failure probabilities for the UFLP. Importantly, the authors go a step further by presenting an exact linear formulation for the UFLP with unreliable facilities by employing the reformulation–linearization technique of Sherali and Alameddine (1992). To efficiently solve medium to large-sized instances, Lagrangian based algorithms as well as a continuous approximation model are proposed. The approximation model is further used to gain basic analytical insights into the problem. In Shen et al. (2011), alternative formulations of the UFLP with unequal failure probabilities are proposed, including a two-stage stochastic program and a nonlinear integer program. Heuristics are used to find near optimal solutions.

Various other extensions of the unreliable p-median problem and UFLP have been considered as well. Continuous versions of the median problem, with facilities located either along a line or in a plane, are investigated in Lee (2001), Berman et al. (2007, 2010), Berman and Krass (2011), and Li and Ouyang (2010). The later three all deal with the case where facility failure probabilities may be correlated. Berman et al. (2009) examine the role that information plays in robust facility design, proposing a median type model in which customers do not have prior information about the operational status of facilities.


                     Qi et al. (2010) investigate the design of an integrated supply chain, taking into account location, working inventory and transportation costs as well as the risk posed by supply disruptions. A linear formulation of the model is provided and solved using a Lagrangian based branch and bound algorithm. The authors show that considerable cost savings can be achieved by considering supply disruptions during the design phase as opposed to operational phase. A similarly structured problem is proposed by Aryanezhad et al. (2010), who further consider random customer demands and the cost of safety stock for avoiding possible stockouts. A genetic algorithm is developed to efficiently solve their nonlinear integer model.

Considerable work on facility reliability has also been carried out within the context of covering type problems. Key work in this area includes backup or redundant coverage formulations (Hogan and ReVelle, 1986), the use of chance constraints (ReVelle and Hogan, 1989a; Marianov and ReVelle, 1996; Haight et al., 2000), and expected coverage models given both equal (Daskin, 1983; Saydam and McKnew, 1985) and unequal (Batta et al., 1989; Camm et al., 2002) facility failure probabilities. Further information on stochastic issues involved in facility location, including facility reliability, are discussed in reviews by Snyder et al. (2006), Snyder (2006) and Owen and Daskin (1998).

Our present work extends Berman et al. (2007) and Cui et al. (2010) by proposing an exact linear reformulation of the unreliable p-median problem given unequal facility disruption probabilities. The problem is naturally represented in nonlinear form using high-degree polynomials to express probability products. We succeed in linearizing this model through the use of a specialized network flow structure, which we term a probability chain, in order to evaluate compound probability terms. The use of this technique is quite general and can be applied in a straightforward manner to other similarly structured problems, such as the maximum covering problem.


                     Morton et al. (2007), as far as we are aware, were the first to employ a network flow structure to linearize probability products in the context of nuclear smuggling interdiction. One of our key aims here is to propose a novel way of constructing such networks. Moreover, as the computational results show, our approach produces much tighter problem formulations and, in turn, significantly reduced solution times compared to Morton et al. (2007).

A further contribution of ours is the development of additional lower bounds and valid inequalities combined with lifting in order to efficiently solve medium to large problem instances. As we have found, problems reformulated using probability chains alone can result in rather weak linear relaxations, particularly for larger problem instances. The bounding constraints and valid inequalities suitably resolve this issue.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we begin by presenting a nonlinear formulation of the unreliable p-median problem and then show how it can be linearized through the introduction of probability chains. This is followed in Section 3 by extensions to the maximum expected covering problem, problems in which co-location is allowed, and even more general problem structures, including bilevel optimization models. In Section 4 we introduce some additional bounds to tighten our linear model. In Section 5 we propose families of valid inequalities that can be incorporated into a cutting plane algorithm. Computational results and key findings are covered in Section 6. Lastly, in Section 7, we end with some concluding remarks and recommendations for future work.

In the following, we seek to locate a total of p unreliable facilities among n possible locations in order to minimize the expected demand weighted distance between a set of m customer demand points and their closest operational facility. In line with Berman et al. (2007), it is assumed that customers have prior information about the operational status of all facilities. If a facility is unavailable, customers must travel to the next closest operating facility. In the event that customers cannot be assigned to any facility (i.e., all fail), a system-wide penalty ϕ is incurred per unit demand.

Formally, let I be the set of customers, indexed by i, and let J, indexed by j, be the set of potential facility locations, where m
                        =∣I∣ and n
                        =∣J∣. Further, let h
                        
                           i
                         represent the demand of customer i and let d
                        
                           ij
                         correspond to the distance between customer i and site j. Index i
                        
                           k
                         is used to denote the kth closest facility to customer i. A facility located at site j is assumed to fail (not fail) with independent probability

                              Model UMP2 is equivalent to UMP1.
                           

The proof immediately follows from Proposition 1.□

Our linear reformulation of UMP is predicated on replacing the products of the x
                        
                           j
                         binary variables in (1) with continuous flow variables y
                        
                           ik
                         and z
                        
                           ik
                        , flow-balance constraints (5) and (6) and bounding constraints (7)–(9). Collectively, these variables and constraints form a specialized flow network for each customer i and serve to iteratively propagate probability terms across each site j in order of distance. We refer to this basic construct as a probability chain.


                        Fig. 1
                         provides an illustrative example of a single probability chain represented in graph form. The idea of forming a probability chain to evaluate compound probabilities like in (1) is actually quite general. As will be shown in the next section, this basic procedure can be applied to linearize other similarly structured problems.

Our use of probability chains to linearize models like UMP is also noteworthy for being highly compact. Problem sizes grow polynomially with respect to the number of demand and location points only (i.e., parameters m and n, respectively). The model proposed in Berman et al. (2007) for the special case of equal facility failure probabilities (i.e., q
                        
                           j
                        
                        =
                        q, ∀j
                        ∈
                        J), in contrast, depends additionally on the number of facilities p. Compared to Cui et al. (2010), which can be easily modified to give an alternative linear formulation of UMP, model UMP2 is significantly more compact. The model in Cui et al. (2010) is based on the use of level assignments, which introduces a large number of variables (containing three indices) and a large number of constraints. Hence, whereas a linear model based on Cui et al. (2010) requires a total of O(mnp) binary variables, O(mnp) continuous variables and O(mnp) constraints, our model involves only O(n) binary variables, O(mn) continuous variables and O(mn) constraints.

A closely related model to UMP is the maximum expected covering problem (MECP). As the name implies, the goal of MECP is to locate p unreliable facilities across a set of n potential locations in order to maximally cover (in an expected sense) m customer demand points. In addition to the notation introduced above for UMP, let J
                        
                           i
                         be the set of facilities covering customer i. Coverage of a particular demand point i is typically determined by a facility coverage radius R such that j

                        J
                        
                           i
                         if d
                        
                           ij
                        
                        <
                        R, where parameters d
                        
                           ij
                         and R represent either distance or travel time. A nonlinear formulation of MECP given unequal failure probabilities, as presented in Camm et al. (2002), is given by:

The objective of MECP (10) is to minimize the expected amount of demand not covered by facilities. The product of the terms involving the x
                        
                           j
                         variables in (10) determines the probability that all facilities covering customer i will simultaneously fail. Specifically, if a facility is located at site j (x
                        
                           j
                        
                        =1), then the probability that i will not be covered by site j is q
                        
                           j
                        , otherwise (x
                        
                           j
                        
                        =0) it is 1. Although framed as a minimization problem, the above model is equivalent to maximizing total expected coverage of demand points.

To reformulate MECP in linear form, we first note that the n
                        
                           i
                        
                        = ∣J
                        
                           i
                        ∣ locations covering a particular customer i can be ordered arbitrarily. With this in place, we redefine i
                        
                           k

                         and redefine variables y

In some situations, there exists the possibility of co-locating multiple facilities at the same site. Co-location is particularly beneficial when the risk of facility failure is comparatively high, in which case it often makes sense to provide backup service at certain critical sites that are centrally located among the demand points (Berman et al., 2007). As it turns out, probability chains can be extended in a straightforward way to deal with this important problem variant.

To model co-location, we begin by defining new location variables x
                        
                           jr
                         equal to 1 if r facilities are placed at site j, 0 otherwise. Assuming that up to p facilities can be located at a given site j, constraints (2) can be replaced with the following.

In terms of an underlying network structure, the extension of probability chains to problems involving co-location simply requires the addition of extra out-flow arcs, one for each y

                        .

It is important to point out that the models considered thus far (i.e., UMP and MECP and their co-location variants) all share a common goal – the minimization of facility failure probabilities. Our development of probability chains, in turn, has assumed that the z

Other problems besides UMP and MECP (and their co-location variants) which can be modeled using class I probability chains include Cui et al. (2010) and O’Hanley et al. (2007) (Appendix: (14)–(18)).

For maximization problems, the probability chain needs to be modified slightly.

                        We refer to (21)–(24) as a class II probability chain. Structurally, a class II probability chain differs from a class I chain in that the y
                        
                           ij
                         variables represent in-flow arcs, as opposed to out-flow arcs (Fig. 3
                        ). Problems that fit this general structure include O’Hanley and Tomberlin (2005) and Losada et al. (2012a).

We note that while the network structure employed in Morton et al. (2007) (Section 2, (2b)–(2f)) for linearizing compound probabilities is equally applicable to the problems we consider here, our formulation of class I and II probability chains is considerably stronger. This is due to the tight upper bounds (21) and (22) on the out-flow/in-flow y
                        
                           ij
                         variables. As the computational results provided below confirm for UMP, this results in markedly reduced branching and solution times.

We further note that the basic probability chain construct can be easily extended to handle even more general problems of the kind considered in Morton et al. (2007). Specifically, in Morton et al. (2007), the set of possible

                         terms making up a compound probability are represented by nodes in a directed, acyclic graph with defined origin and destination nodes (i.e., a flow network). Feasible combinations of terms are determined by the arcs connecting individual nodes. Ultimately, the subset of terms which are active in a compound probability varies depending upon the selected path through the network (i.e., the evaluation of a compound probability is path-dependent). Such problems can be appropriately modeled through the use of probability flow networks (Fig. 4
                        ), a natural extension of probability chains, in which multiple paths exist between the origin and destination nodes in the network as opposed to just one, unique path.

Formally, assume we are given a flow network G
                        =(V,
                        E) with node set V and arc set E. Let ℓ and k be indices for the nodes in V and let s and t denote the origin and destination nodes, respectively. We define a flow propagation variable z

                        ⩾0 for each arc (ℓ,
                        k) in E. Further, let FS (ℓ) denote the set of arcs entering node ℓ and RS(ℓ) the set of arcs leaving node ℓ. For given values of x

The most natural situation in which a probability flow network arises is in the context of leader–follower or static Stackelberg games (Simaan and Cruz, 1973). Such problems are most often formulated as bilevel min–max or max–min optimization models. Here, the x variables are typically assigned by the leader, the y and z flow variables assigned by the follower. In the problem considered by Morton et al. (2007), the upper level determines the location of sensors for a leader who wants to maximize the detection of a nuclear smuggler (evader), while the lower level defines the path of an evader who wants to minimize his probability of detection whilst traveling through a transport network.

Probability flow networks are thus applicable to problems of the following general form

                        , meanwhile, constraints (23), (24), (30) and (31) are sufficient. This leads to two other classes of probability chains: class III defined by (19), (20), (30) and (31) and class IV defined by (23), (24), (30) and (31). On the downside, constraints (30) and (31) are not as tight as (28) and (29), which reduce to (21) and (22) in the case of single-path problems. Hence, class III and IV chains are not as strong as equivalent two-stage probability flow networks. On the other hand, class III and IV chains have a distinct advantage over two-stage probability flow networks in that the compound probability terms can be determined using a single-level formulation involving the minimization or maximization of z

A straightforward implementation would be to add (35)–(37) to UMP2 for all indices i and k. This obviously provides the tightest possible bounds but can lead to lengthy solution times for larger problems due to the additional time needed to solve each node in a branch and bound tree. Initial testing confirmed this. Initial tests also showed that solution times could be significantly reduced by only adding bounds (35)–(37) for the closet

The problem structure of UMP2 favors solutions with small values of z

                      and large values of y

                        ik
                      is biased downward. The valid inequalities presented below work to drive up the value of z
                     
                        ik

                     Proposition 2 below provides a set of coefficient values that are sufficient to make (42) valid for constraint set (5)–(9). Its proof is given in Appendix A. Although not necessarily the optimal choice according to (43), use of the values in Proposition 2 avoids the need to solve (43) by complete enumeration for each coefficient

                     Proposition 3 above provides coefficient values that make (46) generally valid. Its proof is provided in Appendix A as is the proof for Corollary 2 above showing the conditions under which Propositions 2 and 3 yield facet defining inequalities.

As an example of how Propositions 2 and 3 can be used to generate valid inequalities, consider the following. Imagine for a particular customer i that facility failure probabilities for the first 5 locations are given by

In what follows, we refer to the first valid inequality (42) as VI-1 and to the second valid inequality (46) as VI-2. In our implementation, we used a very simple procedure to solve the separation problem for finding violated inequalities. For each customer i, we started with position k
                     =2 and then successively incremented k until we found the first violated VI-1 constraint given a pre-defined lifting order (see below). Intuitively, VI-1, as well as VI-2, is most effective when set A contains all

We considered a number of simple, pre-defined lifting orders for VI-1 and VI-2. Preliminary tests showed that especially strong cuts could be generated for VI-1 by first lifting site i

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this section we evaluate the computational efficiency of our proposed linear model UMP2. We consider problem instances having both equal and unequal (i.e., site-dependent) facility failure probabilities. As benchmarks for UMP2 with equal failure probabilities, we compare against the exact MILP developed in Berman et al. (2007) (Section 5, IP1: (15)–(21)) and a suitably modified version of the MILP given in Cui et al. (2010) (Section 3.1, LRUFL: (3a)-(3e)). We refer to the latter model as the Linear Unreliable Median Problem (LUMP). For the case of unequal failure probabilities, we compare against Cui et al. (2010) and an alternative linearization of UMP based on Morton et al. (2007) (Section 2: (2b)–(2f)), denoted as UMP3.

Results are presented for two different sized instances of the p-median problem.

                              Swain: The Swain dataset (Swain, 1971) has 55 demand/location nodes. Demand weights for the Swain dataset vary from 2 to 71, with smaller demands being more common.


                              USCities: The USCities dataset (Liberatore et al., 2011) contains population data, based on the 2000 census, for the 100 biggest cities and capitals in the contiguous United States. Demands vary from 8.1million to 8 thousand, with the vast majority in the range 100 to 500 thousand.

                        max
                      is the maximum distance between any two locations. Best performance, particularly on the larger UScities dataset was achieved with

                      for the type II bounds.

On the Swain dataset, we tested values of p equal to 5, 10, 15 and 20. On the USCities dataset, p was set to 10, 20, 30 and 40. For comparisons involving equal facility failure probabilities, values for q
                     
                        j
                      were specified as 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 for each site j. For comparisons involving site-dependent failure probabilities, values of q
                     
                        j
                      were uniformly generated in the range 0.02–0.10.

All models were implemented in C++ using CPLEX version 12.1 callable libraries. Experiments were performed on the same quad-core (2.53GHz per chip) HP Z600 workstation with 6GB of RAM, running on Microsoft Windows 7 Professional. Reported times indicate the number of CPU seconds a model took to solve. In all cases, a 3-hour time limit was observed.

Results given equal facility failure probabilities show a very clear pattern in terms of solution time for the three MILP formulations (Tables 1 and 2
                     
                     ). The Berman et al. (2007) model IP1 is by far the fastest with an average solution time of just 0.84seconds for Swain and 9.44seconds for USCities. The next fastest is UMP2, with average solution times of 4.85seconds for Swain and 34.72seconds for USCities. In general, solution times for UMP2 go down as p increases for a fixed value of q. The Cui et al. (2010) model (LUMP) is the slowest by a considerable amount in nearly every single case. Average solution times for LUMP could not be computed because the model failed to solve within the 3-hour time limit in 1 case for Swain and almost half of cases (9 out of 20) for USCities. The remaining gap between the final objective value and the relaxed lower bound in these cases was 12.7% for Swain and ranged from 9.5% to 50.7% for USCities. For instances that could be solved, the average time was 71.09seconds for Swain and 475.33seconds for USCities. These results clearly point to the fairly limited scalability of LUMP when used as a standalone MILP. In fact, the MILP that Cui et al. (2010) devise for the closely related UFLP was originally intended to be used as part of a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm.

Note that the UMP2 results for Swain were generated without the use of additional lower bounds or valid inequalities. This produced somewhat better results in terms of overall solution time. For the USCities dataset, we ran various experiments with and without the bounds included. Without the bounds, UMP2 was highly sensitive to the values of the probabilities. Instances with high probabilities (i.e., q
                     =0.15 and q
                     =0.2), in particular, presented great difficulty. In a number of cases, a verified optimum could not be found within the 3-hour time limit. The bounds were thus particularly helpful for problems with high facility failure probabilities, allowing us to solve all instances in under 4minutes.

One of the more interesting findings was that numerical errors were detected for both IP1 and LUMP. In 4 of the cases for Swain and 10 cases for USCities, LUMP terminated with a reported objective significantly in excess of the true value. IP1 terminated with incorrect values in 3 cases for USCities. These mostly occurred for larger values of p and q. For p
                     =15, q
                     =0.2 on Swain, for example, the reported objective for LUMP was 1954.10 when, in fact, the actual value corresponding to this solution was 1,868.78.

On the Swain dataset, numerical issues did not cause LUMP or IP1 to suffer from lack of optimality. The true objective value of the best feasible solution found was optimal in all cases. On USCities, however, a true optimum was never found by IP1 when numerical errors arose. The optimality gap averaged 5.1% for IP1 in these 3 cases. In a handful of cases, an optimal solution was found by LUMP when numerical errors occurred. Overall, LUMP fared significantly better than IP1 on USCities, with an average nonzero optimality gap of just 0.8%.


                     Berman et al. (2007) also observed numerical difficulties during experimentation with IP1. They attributed this to the ill-conditioning of the objective function, which contains terms (involving powers of q) that differ by many orders magnitude. The constraints in LUMP are similarly ill-conditioned. We tried a number of different fixes to eliminate the numerical errors of IP1 and LUMP, including rescaling the objective and constraints. None of these resolved the problem.

Looking at the number of nodes searched during branching, UMP2 was able to find an optimum at the root node in a fair number of cases for Swain (8 out of 20) and all but 1 case for USCities. IP1 produced the tightest models, finding an optimum at the root node in every single case for both datasets (albeit with numerical imprecision on occasion). LUMP very frequently found a solution at the root node for Swain. On this dataset, it usually required less branching than UMP2 except when an optimum could not be found within the 3-hour time limit. On USCities, LUMP found an optimal solution at the root node in half of the cases but branched much more in comparison to IP1 and UMP2 on the other half.

Given unequal facility failure probabilities (Table 3
                     ), UMP2 managed to find an optimal solution in a matter of seconds for Swain and about 2minutes (128.90seconds) on average for USCities. As in the case with equal probabilities, solution time usually went down as p increased. LUMP, on the other hand, was never able to find a verified optimum within the specified time limit for either dataset. The remaining gap between the final objective and the relaxed lower bound after 3hours, averaged 4.9% for Swain and 53.2% for USCities. Such gaps tended to go up with increasing p. In 2 out of 4 cases for Swain, the best feasible solution at termination was actually optimal based on comparison with UMP2. In the other 2 cases, the best feasible solutions were close but not quite optimal with a gap of 0.1% for both p
                     =30 and p
                     =40. On the larger USCities dataset, optimality gaps were considerably larger, ranging from 0.9% to 9.0%.

The recurring finding that UMP2 is much more efficient than LUMP is not at all surprising. For LUMP, the number of variables and constraints is dependent on p; for UMP2 it is independent of p. On Swain, for example, the number of variables and constraints for UMP2 is 6,105 and 9,021, respectively, for both p
                     =5 and p
                     =20. For LUMP, the number of variables increases from 55,495 to 194,095 going from p
                     =5 to p
                     =20, while the number of constraints increases from 77,221 to 262,846. In fact, the results with unequal failure probabilities (Table 3) actually show that UMP2 becomes easier to solve as p increases whereas the percent optimality gap for LUMP increases.

In a further set of experiments, we compared our proposed linearization of UMP against that of Morton et al. (2007) on the USCities dataset (Table 4
                     ). To make a direct comparison, lower bounding constraints but not valid inequalities were included for both models. By every measure, our probability chain construct outperforms Morton et al. (2007). The linear model of UMP based on Morton et al. (2007) required in all cases more nodes (more than 3 times on average), more iterations (twice as many on average) and, critically, more time (two and a half times on average) to solve. Clearly, constraints (5)–(9) provide much tighter linear programming relaxations.

In summary, UMP2 is highly competitive with IP1 for the case of equal probabilities and unlike IP1 does not suffer from numerical issues. For unequal probabilities, UMP2 is clearly superior to LUMP, both in terms of solution time and quality (particularly for problems with large p and small probability of facility failure). Our linear model also performs better than Morton et al. (2007).

Finally, we examined how the addition of valid inequalities VI-1 and VI-2 to UMP2 affected performance on the larger USCities dataset (Table 5
                     ). In all cases, solution times were lower with the cuts versus without. For the most difficult case (p
                     =10), in fact, solution time decreased by 37%, going from 472.04seconds down to 297.56seconds. The total numbers of nodes visited and iterations were also reduced quite considerably (by 74% and 13% on average, respectively) when cuts were included. Cuts VI-1 were added more frequently than VI-2 by a margin of about 2 to 1.

The effect of adding cuts VI-1 and VI-2 was even more dramatic for model MECP2, as the results for USCities with unequal failure probabilities show (Table 6
                     ). The coverage matrix used for USCities was constructed by applying a 300 mile radius around each location, resulting in a 0–1 matrix with 10% density. The use of valid inequalities was highly effective in tightening MECP2. Branching on the USCities dataset was reduced by more than 3 orders of magnitude on average by including the valid inequalities: 1,732,366 nodes without the cuts versus 3,306 with the cuts. Solution time for USCities was roughly the same for p
                     =10,20 with the cuts included but decreased significantly for p
                     =30,40. Critically, addition of the cuts allowed p
                     =40 to be solved in just over 5minutes, whereas without the cuts there was a persistent 1.5% optimality gap at the 3-hour time limit. Unlike UMP2, the second inequality VI-2 was violated more frequently.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The incorporation of reliability into facility location planning is an important issue that has received growing attention in the literature. In this article, we focus on a well-known problem: the unreliable p-median problem (UMP). Linear formulations of this problem exist but have serious limitations. Some are not applicable to problem instances where facility failure probabilities vary. Others, for the case of site-dependent failure probabilities, have very limited scalability.

We manage to overcome these limitations by proposing a new exact linear formulation of UMP given site-dependent failure probabilities. The linearization method we employ is based on the idea of forming a probability chain in which a specialized flow network is introduced to evaluate compound probability terms. The resulting model is compact in terms of the number of added variables and constraints. To improve the efficiency of the model on large problem instances, we (i) devise additional lower bounds and (ii) propose two families of valid inequalities. The latter can be embedded within a branch and cut framework to solve any type of problem involving probability chain (5)–(9).

Computational experiments clearly demonstrate that our reformulation is competitive if not superior, in terms of solution time, to existing formulations of UMP. Critically, our reformulation does not suffer from approximation errors or other numerical issues, which frequently caused the other formulations we tested to terminate with suboptimal solutions.

We emphasize that the use of probability chains and probability flow networks more broadly for linearizing compound probabilities is quite general. A variety of similarly structured problems can be linearized using our basic approach. Among these are the reliable UFLP (Cui et al., 2010), various facility interdiction and protection planning problems (Losada et al., 2012a; Scaparra, 2009), nuclear smuggling interdiction models (Morton et al., 2007), multi-period nature reserve selection problems (O’Hanley et al., 2007) and river connectivity models (O’Hanley and Tomberlin, 2005).

                              i1 can be derived by substituting (5) into (7), so it too is facet defining.
