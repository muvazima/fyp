                  A suitable Cellular Potts Model is developed to reproduce and analyze an in vitro wound-healing assay. The proposed approach is able both to quantify the invasive capacity of the overall cell population and to evaluate selected determinants of single cell movement (velocity, directional movement, and final displacement). In this respect, the present CPM allows us to capture differences and correlations in the migratory behavior of cells initially located at different distances from the wound edge. In the case of an undifferentiated extracellular matrix, the model then predicts that a maximal healing can be obtained by a chemically induced increment of cell elasticity and not by a chemically induced downregulation of intercellular adhesive contacts. Moreover, in the case of two-component substrates (formed by a mesh of collagenous-like threads and by a homogeneous medium), CPM simulations show that both fiber number and cell–fiber adhesiveness influence cell speed and wound closure rate in a biphasic fashion. On the contrary, the topology of the fibrous network affects the healing process by mediating the productive directional cell movement. The paper, also equipped with comments on the computational cost of the CPM algorithm, ends with a throughout discussion of the pertinent experimental and theoretical literature.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cell migration is a fundamental process occurring in a wide range of physio-pathological situations, both in embryogenesis and in adult life. Cells can move individually or collectively, i.e., as multicellular aggregates. Single cell migration is mainly regulated by cellular and subcellular mechanisms, including actin filaments polymerization [91,99,104], focal adhesion point turnovers [65] and proteolytic activity [138,139]. Mechanotransduction and inside-out signal exchange with the extracellular environment are important as well [126]. Collective migration involves instead multicellular dynamics, mainly coordinated via cell–cell junctions [45,66,128]. Functional and phenotypical differentiations of individuals within the same aggregate also occur during multicellular movement [66]. Samples of collective cell migration can be found in morphogenesis, cancer growth and development, and tissue repair after lesions [45].

Coordinated movement of cell populations has been analyzed by a wide range of in vitro models (see [3,53,63,64,67,113] for relevant examples). In particular, one of the most commonly employed experimental systems is the in vitro wound healing assay 
                     [11,13,15,41,84,101,128,141]. It is based on a cell monolayer first grown to confluence and then artificially scraped using a sharp object (such as pipette tip), see Fig. 1
                     . Wounded areas can be created with other procedures as well [44,92]. The wound healing assay can be considered the laboratory counterpart of an in vivo heal of a lesion. The rate of advance of the wound edge, i.e., the quantification of the area recolonized, gives a measure of the migratory capacity of the population of interest. In this respect, this technique is widely used to compare the invasive potential of specific cell lines either in “resting conditions” (in serum-deprived medium, i.e., in low concentration of growth factors and hormones) or in response to (i) specific chemical stimulations, (ii) modifications of the expression of molecules putatively involved in migratory processes and (iii) topological and structural variations of the matrix-like coating substrates. This last aspect is particularly exploited by biomedical sciences, with the aim of producing and testing bioengineered scaffolds which can provide optimal extracellular environments for regrowth and regeneration of tissues, for example skin, peripheral nerves, bones or cartilage (the literature on this topic is very large, the reader can refer for instance to [19,122,142] and references therein).

In this paper, an experimental wound healing assay is reproduced by a suitable version of the Cellular Potts Model (CPM), a lattice-based Monte Carlo technique which employs a stochastic energy minimization to display the evolution over time of cell systems [6,57,58,60,83]. The proposed model integrates a series of previous works that, based on the CPM extensions presented in [116,117], deal with different aspects of cell migration within selected matrix environments [118–120]. However, with respect to those papers, the focus here is the analysis of the collective invasive ability of an entire cell population rather than the study of the migratory capacity of single or isolated cells. From this perspective, this paper aims at investigating not only the effect on wound recovering of variations in cell and matrix determinants, but also the role played by a spontaneous phenotypical differentiation (i.e., not prescribed a priori by the model) occurring between individuals located in specific areas of the cell culture (i.e., at different distances from the wound edge).

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 clarifies the assumptions on which the proposed approach is based. As a relevant model feature, each virtual cell is represented as a discrete compartmentalized object (differentiated in nucleus, cytosol and plasma membrane) with individual properties. Different types of substrate, which differ for homogeneity, topology and density of fibrous component, are employed as well. Selected numerical results are shown in Section 3. The end of Section 3 focuses on a study of the computational cost of the CPM algorithm. The simulation outcomes are finally discussed in Section 4, where comparisons with proper results from both the experimental and the pertinent computational literature are provided as well.


                     In vitro wound healing is simulated using an extended Cellular Potts Model, a grid-based stochastic approach, which describes the evolution of the cell culture in energetic terms and elastic constraints. The simulation domain is a bidimensional lattice (i.e., a regular numerical repeated graph)

                        σ
                        (
                        x
                        )
                        ∈
                        N
                     , which can be interpreted as a degenerate spin originally coming from statistical physics [69,100]. Subdomains of contiguous sites with identical spin form discrete standard objects, which are characterized by an object type, τ. The virtual cells, identified by an integer 
                        η
                        =
                        1
                        ,
                        …
                        ,
                        N
                      where N is their total number, are here defined as compartmentalized objects. They are in fact composed of three subunits which, in turn, are standard CPM objects: the nucleus, a central more or less round cluster of type 
                        τ
                        =
                        N
                     , the surrounding cytosol, 
                        τ
                        =
                        C
                     , and the plasma membrane (PM), 
                        τ
                        =
                        M
                     , which is one-site wide and encloses the entire cell, see Fig. 2
                     . Each subcellular compartment is obviously characterized, as an off-lattice additional attribute, by the cluster id η to identify the cell it belongs to. The nuclear membrane is not explicitly modeled, as it is defined as the interface between the cytosolic compartment and the nuclear region.


                     Terminological remark: Compartmentalized objects indicate CPM elements (in this case, cells) composed by a set of standard CPM objects which, in turn, indicate simple lattice subdomains sharing the same spin (in this case, cell nuclei, cytosolic regions, and plasma membranes).

The cell population is seeded on a matrix substrate, which is differentiated in a homogeneous medium-like state, 
                        τ
                        =
                        Q
                     , and an inhomogeneous collagen-like state, 
                        τ
                        =
                        F
                     . The medium-like state simulates a gelatinous substrate, which is composed by a mixture of soluble components (among others, long carbohydrate polymers, and non-proteoglycan polysaccharides) and water solvent. It is assumed to be isotropically distributed throughout the simulation domain, forming no large-scale structures. Instead the collagen-like state represents fixed assemblies of insoluble macromolecules, such as collagens, laminin and elastin, that associate into fibers. Each fiber is here individually modeled by a standard non-compartmentalized CPM object. Distribution and number of fibrous structures will be specified in Section 3 and will reproduce different types of matrix substrates typically employed for in vitro assays. The inclusion of an explicit two-component extracellular environment is already present in some CPM applications focused on tumor growth [56,107] and single cell migration [118]. It is also a fundamental aspect of this work because it allows a detailed analysis of the relationship between selected determinants of the matrix substrate (i.e., density and topology) and the healing properties of the cell culture.

Cell dynamics are determined by an energy minimization principle. In more detail, the simulated system evolves to iteratively and stochastically reduce its free energy, given by an Hamiltonian H, whose expression will be clarified below. The core algorithm is a modified version of the classical Metropolis method for Monte Carlo–Boltzmann thermodynamics [60,89]. It is particularly suitable to implement the natural exploratory behavior of cells, reproducing their cytoskeletally driven membrane fluctuations and extensions of pseudopods through repeated probabilistic updates of the site identification spins σ.

During wound invasion, cells can only temporarily occupy, but not permanently modify, the position or the original content of a matrix site. For example, if a cell moves from a site previously occupied by a fiber, the site is restored to its previous collagenous-like state. In this respect, the virtual substrate is assumed passive and conserved, as matrix digestion and/or deposition are neglected.

For any given MCS t, the system free energy, whose minimization, as seen, drives the evolution of the cell culture, is

Assuming that cells do not significantly grow during the healing process (here nutrients are not taken into account), the fluctuations of their volumes are kept negligible with high constant values of

                      are a measure of the affinity between cell surface adhesion complexes (i.e., sugar-binding receptors or integrins) to either non-solid (i.e., glycosaminoglycans in medium) or solid (i.e., fibrillar collagen) extracellular ligands [112]. As given in Table 1
                     , and explained in the section on Material and Methods, external and internal contact energies are set constant in time and homogeneous in space. However, a set of simulations will dissect the role in the healing process of an agent-induced downregulation of cell–cell adhesive interactions, which is observed in a wide range of cell lines stimulated by several substances.

This simplification is realistic since the capacity of a cell to absorb chemicals typically saturates to a limit, which is established both by the density of membrane-bound receptors and by the rate at which the chemical substance can be internalized and the receptors recycled, see also [8,79]. In particular, 
                        λ
                        <
                        k
                     , as the chemical natural decay is assumed to be negligible compared to the cell uptake.

The simulation domain Ω is a lattice of 350×500 sites. The characteristic length of each site is scaled to 
                           2
                           
                           μ
                           m
                        : therefore Ω represents a section of a well of size 0.7mm×1mm. As explained in the section on Materials and Methods, an empirical calibration between numerical and experimental results allows us to find out the correspondence between 1 MCS and 2s. The boundary conditions of domain Ω are zero flux at the left side (i.e., at x=0) and periodic at the others (i.e., at x=350, y=0, and y=500). The no flux assumption at x=0 is appropriate as cell populations in wound healing assays grow to confluence and therefore there is no space for cells to move in that direction of the domain. The periodic boundary conditions at the top and the bottom of the lattice are also reasonable since the model deals with a section of a much larger well. The periodic conditions at x=350 are instead arbitrarily set to reduce boundary effects.

In all simulation setting, the stimulation with the chemical substance is modeled by imposing in Eq. (6)

                           195
                           ]
                         min (i.e., for

                         MCS). This condition implements a constant addition of a saturating (i.e., very high) level of chemical for 30min after 2h and 45min from wound scraping.

The algorithm underlying the proposed simulations combines a numerical scheme for solving the reaction–diffusion equation of the chemical substance with an iterative procedure for implementing the Metropolis Monte Carlo method characteristic of CPM approaches. In more detail, the former manages the evolution of the chemical concentration while the latter updates cell positions. This resulting conceptual algorithm, schematized in Fig. 3
                         (left panel), can be described as follows:
                           
                              1.
                              
                                 Initialization:
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             •
                                          
                                       
                                       The initial configuration of all simulations consists of a mass of compartmentalized cells (the initial/target dimensions of the three subcellular units are given in Table 1) placed at the 175 site×500 site (i.e., 0.35mm×1mm) left part of the domain (see the right panel of Fig. 3). The area deprived of cells reproduces the experimental wound. The width of the scratch (i.e., 175 site ≈0.35mm) is lower than in most experimental cases to avoid cell overlapping and to supply to the absence of mitosis. The intracellular basal concentration of the chemical, c
                                          0, is assumed to be spatially homogeneous, while the initial extracellular level of the substance is zero. All cells are assumed to have the very same basal properties (i.e., intrinsic motility, adhesiveness, elasticity). The type of matrix will change for each set of simulations.

The cell culture is then annealed for 100 Monte Carlo sweeps according to the following rule:

                                          The annealing procedure prevents matrix-like spins from intermixing with cell spins, therefore allowing the formation of natural-looking and coherent cell boundaries. It also allows us to have stable contacts between the subcompartments forming each individual cell.

The continuous equation of the chemical is rederived, according the new cell configuration, and solved, using a finite element scheme on a grid with the same spatial resolution as Ω, characterized by 10 diffusion time steps per MCS (this temporal step is sufficiently small to guarantee numerical stability).

The properties of all cells (i.e., motility and, eventually, elasticity and adhesiveness) are updated, given their new biochemical state (i.e., the new amount of internalized chemical molecules).

The Hamiltonian functional in Eq. (2) is recalculated, and the system is ready to evolve again.


                                 Final time. To model a pure migration assay, the overall observation period is set equal to 21600 MCS, which correspond to nearly 12h, for all simulation settings. This choice assures a sufficient distance from critical events, such as culture splitting and cell cycle synchronization.

The first sets of simulations analyze the healing capacity of the cell population in an isotropic collagen-free matrix.

                         for any t in Eq. (6)), the virtual culture is characterized by a poor invasive phenotype, as

                         (see Fig. 4
                        ). This phenomenology is the consequence of the low basal cell motility, given by T
                        0 in Eq. (2), which is not able to overcome intercellular adhesive contacts thereby not allowing single individuals to spread in the wound area. In this respect, the slight expansion of the population edge is only due to cell body relaxation. On the other hand, upon chemical stimulation, the cell culture is observed to have a significant invasive ability, as the population edge (now composed by a front of dispersed individuals) is strongly biased towards the gap (
                           D

Differences and correlations in the migratory behavior of groups of cells located at different distances from the edge of the wound can now be analyzed. In particular, external, middle and internal cell subpopulations can be distinguished (see the graphically delimited regions in Fig. 5). For consistency, the correspondence between each subpopulation and the specific representative color, i.e., red-external, blue-middle, green-internal, is maintained hereafter in all graphs. As quantitatively evaluated in Fig. 6
                        , cells placed close to the edge of the scratch are characterized by a high short-range motility. In particular, such external individuals typically move according to angles that moderately cluster around the expected direction, i.e., towards the middle of the wound, showing indeed a quite relevant value of linearity (
                           L
                           ≈
                           0.6
                        ). Cells located in an intermediate position have instead decreased net displacement and linearity. Finally, cells far away from the front of the culture feature an almost negligible movement. A further confirmation of the different dynamics of the three subpopulations is given by the modulus of their instantaneous velocity, plotted in Fig. 6(C): external cells move significantly faster than middle cells, and the velocity is almost negligible for internal individuals. It is indeed possible to state that the migratory capability of a cell decreases when its initial distance from the edge of the wound increases. The rationale of such a phenotypic differentiation is two-fold: on one hand, cells placed in the more external regions of the culture have access to a greater amount of chemical factor (which is almost completely uptaken before diffusing in the internal areas of the mass), thereby enhancing their motility. On the other hand, cells located far enough from the wound edge experience higher cell densities and therefore are subjected to the so-called contact inhibition of cell locomotion. This phenomenon, first proposed by Abercrombie [1] and widely observed in wound healing models of epithelial cell lines [143] and fibroblast cultures [132], consists in the fact that cells within closely packed aggregates do not move since they are strictly held by surrounding individuals (via intercellular adhesiveness). Finally, from Fig. 6(C), it is possible to observe that, for any cell η, 
                           |
                           v
                           (
                           t
                           )
                           |
                         is an increasing function of time. This characteristic of the cell speed (obviously more evident for external individuals) depends on the fact that (i) the intracellular amount of chemical 
                           
                              
                                 c
                              
                              
                                 η
                              
                           
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         raises up and (ii) as the culture expansion advances, cells are surrounded by more open space to spread across.

In order to validate the proposed theoretical approach, the results obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations are now compared with the outcomes of selected wound healing assays performed by the group of Prof. Funaro and E. Ortolan at the Laboratory of Immunogenetics of the University of Turin Medical School. In particular, their experiments focus on the healing behavior of cultures of ovarian cancer cells (specifically, NIH:OVCAR-3) stimulated or not with CD157. CD157 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein encoded by a member of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase (NADase)/ADP-ribosyl cyclase gene family [43,70,95]. It is involved in several cellular functions, including regulation of humoral immune response and of leukocyte trafficking [51,52,68]. CD157 also affects the interactions between the mesothelium and ovarian tumor cells, ultimately controling ovarian cancer dissemination and peritoneal invasion [94]. As summarized in Fig. 7
                        , the experimental cell cultures behave similar to the virtual cell populations both in the non-stimulated condition (MOCK) and after CD157 treatment. In more detail, a minimal advance of cell population edges is observed without CD157 transfection. On the opposite, significant wound invasion is observed upon chemical stimulation. To further compare in silico and in vitro outcomes, initial and final position of some representative experimental cells, initially located at different distances from the borders of the scratch, are tracked and the linearity of their migration is computed. As it is possible to observe in the corresponding panels of Fig. 7, the resulting migratory determinants are consistent with those measured for the corresponding subpopulations of virtual cells.


                        Terminological remark: Hereafter in the paper, the simulation setting presented in Figs. 5 and 6 will be indicated and recalled as the “reference case”.


                        Chemically induced decrease of intercellular adhesiveness: A number of in vitro experiments highlight that a variety of chemicals are able to stimulate cell motility by downregulating cadherin expression and/or activity, i.e., by disrupting cell–cell contact interactions. For example, the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) causes a loss in E-cadherin signaling in both normal and neoplastic epithelial cells, which consequently feature a dispersed/scattered phenotype [32,34,137]. These considerations prompt to investigate the effect on the invasive behavior of the cell population of a chemically induced decrement in cell–cell adhesiveness. In this respect, a plausible constitutive law for the intercellular adhesiveness reads:

                         is the typical adhesive force of resting cells. Notice that relation (8) allows us to account for time and space variations (i.e., inhomogeneities along the plasma membrane) of cell–cell adhesiveness. As represented in Fig. 8
                        , the resulting culture invasion of the gap is somewhat quicker but not depth as one could expect. It is in fact possible to observe a dramatic expansion of the cell population during the 3h after the chemical stimulation, followed by a stabilization of the wound closure rate. In this respect, the final percentage of invasion is quite similar to the reference case. The observed healing behavior can be explained with the following considerations. The chemical stimulation immediately downregulates adhesive interactions between external cells, which therefore are allowed to quickly spread away from the rest of the mass. Also middle and internal cells undergo a progressive repulsion, with the consequent formation of little islands of free substrate within the culture. Such areas deprived of cells are then filled again by surrounding shedding individuals, thereby do not bias the overall invasion. By analyzing the behavior of the different subpopulations, it is possible to observe that (i) the velocity of external cells increases significantly in the aforesaid 3-h time lapse, before stabilizing at the reference value; (ii) both internal and middle individuals move faster than in the reference case (this is due to the fact that they dissociate and therefore are longer subjected to the above-mentioned contact inhibition of motility, see Fig. 8(E)); (iii) cell average linearity and net final displacement remain however comparable to the reference case, as shown in Fig. 8(C–D). From these results, it is possible to conclude that a chemically induced alteration in cell–cell adhesiveness has, at least in the proposed CPM simulations, a relatively subtle effect on the effective healing capability of a cell population. It in fact affects only the wound closure rate in the initial phases. As a counter proof, a non-stimulated cell population features a negligible healing with the observation period even with a very low value of cell–cell adhesiveness (not shown).

                         are defined as in Eq. (2) and ν is, as seen, the intrinsic cell resistance to compression. Relation (9) models the activity of chemical substances that, in a dose-dependent manner, either directly facilitate acto–myosin interactions (such as calcium ions [12]) or activate downstream pathways resulting in actin filaments polarization (for example VEGF isoforms [36,134]). The consequence of the new model hypothesis is an almost complete closure of the wound within the observation period (i.e.,

                        , see Fig. 9
                        (A–B)). The increased invasive capacity of the population is mainly due to the fact that external cells are able to migrate significantly far across the wound area. In this respect, their movement is characterized by an increment both in the speed value and, more relevantly, in the linearity (i.e., in the directional component), as shown in Fig. 9(C–E). This phenomenology is due to the fact that cells at the front of the culture have sufficient open environs to expand and, stimulated by the availability of chemical factor, organize in a motile elongated phenotype. Such a morphological transition allows them to maintain over time the direction of motion defined by their geometry (persistent migration) and therefore to go on traversing the lattice more readily. In turn, this is the reason why the wound closure rate does not stabilize around a threshold value. On the contrary, middle and internal cells, maintaining strong adhesive interactions, are not able to efficiently remodel. As a consequence, they are not observed to have marked changes in velocity, linearity and final displacement distributions w.r.t. the reference setting.

The next simulation settings analyze the healing of the chemically stimulated population in the case of two-component substrates. In particular, the length of single collagenous fibers is set equal to 6 lattice sites (

In the first set of realizations, an isotropic, moderately dense matrix is formed by a mesh of 1600 collagen threads, equally distributed along each x and y-direction. Because the fibers are randomly arranged, they can overlap: however, the overlap sites are treated identically to non-overlap sites. In these conditions, the cell population displays an evidently increased migratory and invasive phenotype, as the wound is completely recovered within 9h, see Fig. 10
                        (B). In particular, the fibrous structure of the matrix does not influence the directional component of cell movement but strongly enhances cell velocity and final displacement, as represented in Fig. 10(C–E). This phenomenology, which is observed for all cell subpopulations but more evident for external individuals, is due to the fact that cells take advantage of the presence of fibrous bundles for traction and further movement. In other words, they use collagenous-sites as “handholds” for deeply invading the gap.

                        Variation of fiber number: The effect of varying the density of the fibrous component of the substrate is then considered. In this respect, the cell population is planted on lattices with an increasing number of isotropic (i.e., equally distributed along each x and y-axis) fibers, from a low-density mesh to a very high-density scaffold, see Fig. 12
                        (A). As represented in Fig. 12(B), at a number of threads 
                           <
                           250
                        , the lattice is unsaturated and not percolated, and the culture development bears much similarity to the case of a collagen-free environment (see the reference setting for comparison), as only few external cells interact with collagen-like sites, as represented in the corresponding representative panel in Fig. 14. At low fiber density cells are in fact unable to find sufficient collagen-like sites to attach and use for displacement. At moderate amounts of threads (250, 3000), the invasive capacity of the culture increases with the number of the fibers. The cells (also those in the middle of the mass) find in fact an increasing number of locally available threads to adhere and follow for their migration. Finally, at higher investigated fiber numbers, the healing of the cell population substantially decreases again. An overabundance of fibers causes in fact cells to loose their preference towards collagen contacts, preventing their detachment and further spreading. In particular, when the matrix is formed by a continuous carpet of threads (
                           >
                           20
                           
                           000
                        ), the migratory capacity of the culture clearly resembles again that observed in the case of the undifferentiated gelatinous substrate, see Fig. 14(B). Interestingly, the above-described biphasic phenomenology is mediated by a corresponding variation in the instantaneous velocity of cells, whereas the directional component of their movement remains almost unaltered for all the proposed substrates, see panels (C) and (D) of Fig. 12.


                        Variation of fiber alignment: Finally the development of the cell population in the case of anisotropic matrices is analyzed, see Fig. 13
                        . In particular, substrates formed by 1600 aligned threads disposed with increasing angles ϕ with respect to the x-axis are employed. The maximal invasion is found in the case of ϕ=0, i.e., when the fibers are aligned along the horizontal direction, as the wound is completely filled in 6h, see Fig. 13(B). In particular, external and middle cells are seen to orient alongside collagenous components, which behave as a directional contact-guidance, thereby facilitating cell productive motion towards the center of the lesion, as detailed in Fig. 14
                        (C). Increments in ϕ result in decrements in the healing capability of the culture. Finally, for ϕ=90° (i.e, all threads are disposed along the y-direction) wound invasion is substantially low. In this case, cells tend in fact to cluster around the nearest matrix fibers, whose distribution discourages a further migration towards the scratch, eventually inhibiting the overall invasion, see Fig. 14(D). The variation of the fiber distribution has a clear influence on the linearity characterizing cell migration, while cell mean velocity remains almost constant, as represented in Fig. 13(C–D).

As widely known, one of the main drawbacks of CPM implementations is that the underlying algorithm is computationally very expensive, mainly because of the low acceptance probabilities of spin update occurring during each MCS (for a detailed dissertation of this issue the reader is referred to [6,24]). In this respect, the different sets of simulations presented in this work are now analyzed from a numerical viewpoint. In particular, Fig. 15
                         shows the running time needed to reach the final observation time (21600 MCS) in selected representative settings: in particular, the so-called “reference case” is, as seen, the one presented in Figs. 5 and 6 while the “two-component matrix case” is the one presented in Fig. 10. First, it can be observed that in the reference case the rate between running time and MCS is approximatively 1/5.4. The implementation of chemical-dependent cell properties results instead in a two-fold increment of running time. In particular, the slight difference between the two values is due to the fact that the elasticity is a global cell parameter, which therefore requires for each MCS the evaluation of the total intracellular amount of chemical, whereas the adhesive strength requires only to monitor local concentrations of the molecular substance. The realizations dealing with two-component matrices (regardless of number and topology of fibers) are instead characterized by almost the same running time as the reference simulation. This is due to the fact that the collagenous components of the matrix are fixed and therefore negligible from a computational viewpoint. Finally, the last value of the plot refers to a simulation of a wound healing assay in the reference setting which employs uncompartmentalized cells (i.e., cells represented by standard CPM objects, thereby without the differentiation in nucleus, cytoplasm and membrane). It is interesting to notice that the running time significantly decreases. The underlying reason is that internal cell compartments are treated by the algorithm as independent CPM objects: therefore, even if the number of cells is the same in the two cases, the number of computational objects varies (i.e., the rate between cells and subunits is 1/3). For the sake of completeness, it is however possible to hypothesize that a population of uncompartmentalized cells wound require less time to invade a wound than a population composed of compartmentalized individuals (in comparable settings). In fact, uncompartmentalized cells would not have to push across the matrix their stiff and less motile nuclear cluster during motion.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this work, a simple and intuitive version of the Cellular Potts Model has been proposed to reproduce an in vitro wound healing assay, which is one of the most widespread experimental models used to assess the collective and coordinated movement of a multicellular population [11,13,15,41,44,84,92,101,128,141]. In particular, wound healing experiments quantify the capacity of a cell monolayer to invade a scratch in different biological conditions. In this respect, relevant measures are the percentage of the recolonized area and the time needed by the culture to completely repair the wound.

As a distinct model feature, each cell has been represented by a compartmentalized element (i.e., explicitly composed of nucleus, cytosol and plasma membrane), characterized by its own properties (i.e., motility, elasticity and adhesiveness). Variations in structural properties of the matrix substrate have been employed as well, with particular emphasis on density and topology of the fibrous component. The presented approach has been able to describe the invasive behavior of the whole cell population and to evaluate selected migratory determinants (instantaneous velocity, linearity and distribution of the final displacement) of single component individuals. The healing capability of the cell culture has been indeed assessed as the sum of coordinated individual dynamics. In particular, it has been possible to detect the existence of well defined cell subpopulations (namely external, middle, and internal), located at increasing distances from the wound edge and characterized by distinct motility phenotypes. In this respect, simulation outcomes have provided the fact that the healing behavior the population is mainly dictated by the invasive dynamics of the external cells. Intermediate cells have been in fact observed to have a reduced migratory capacity, which is almost negligible for internal individuals. These results have been confirmed, at least in the case of a homogeneous gelatinous substrate, by a proper comparison with wound healing experiments performed by the group of Funaro and Ortolan on ovarian cancer cells, treated or not with CD157.

The role played by the more external cells in wound closure processes has been clearly identified in the experimental literature and commonly denoted as lamellipodia crawling 
                     [44,84,109]. This mechanisms relies in fact on the active spreading and migration of individual cells located near the wound edge, which is regulated by specific intercellular biochemical signaling typically activated by mechanical injuries of cell monolayers (i.e., a scratch done by a pipette tip [72,73,92,141]). It has been argued that, in some cases, an availability of free space is sufficient to initiate external cell migration even in the absence of a mechanical injury [13,92,101]. For the sake of completeness, it is useful to mention that a second mechanism of cell movement observed in round wound healing processes is the so-called purse string. It consists in a marginal actomyosin cable development along the wound edge, so that wound closure proceeds with contraction of the actin belt [11,84]. Closure of small wounds in cultures of intestinal epithelial cells can involve the formation of both lamellipodia and purse-string structures as well [11].

The cell phenotypic differentiation captured in the presented CPM is validated by a series of experimental works focused on Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. For instance, in [92], the distance traveled by cells during healing has been observed to be inversely proportional to their initial distance from the edge of the wound (being almost negligible for individuals located far enough from the wound front, consistently with the case of the internal cells of the proposed CPM approach). The authors have found the rationale of this behavior in the specific spatiotemporal pattern of MAPK phosphorylation waves. Such signaling pathways, initiated as a consequence of a mechanical injury of the monolayer, propagate in fact from the edge of the culture to the rest of the mass up to a characteristic distance (nearly 
                        500
                        
                        μ
                        m
                     ). Further, these dynamics have not been observed in uninjured cell sheets (the MAPK cascade is no longer activated) or in injured cell sheets treated with MAPK inhibitor. In [41,42], the authors have provided the fact that a fundamental role in wound closure, at least in MDCK epithelial cell monolayers, is played by cells located several rows behind the wound margin (i.e., which correspond to the so-called middle subpopulation of this work). Such submarginal cells have been in fact observed to be able to autonomously initiate migration (by sensing a lowered resistance to movement in one direction or by some chemical or electrical signaling mechanisms) and generate active forces, thereby pushing the more external cells to close the wound. In other words, cells behind the margin are able to actively crawl and coordinately move towards the wound area instead of just passively moving when cells at the margin pull on them. The proposed CPM does not distinguish between active and passive intercellular forces and interactions. It is however possible to speculate that also the virtual middle cells do not move as a consequence of dragging forces exerted via adhesion by external individuals. In accordance with the experimental works, they in fact actively wander in their open proximity. However, as seen more clearly in the case of a chemically induced downregulation of intercellular adhesiveness, the crawling of middle individuals does not significantly bias the overall healing potential of the population which, as seen, remains mainly determined by the dynamics of cells located near the wound edge.

Specific simulation settings have then demonstrated that, in the case of a homogeneous substrate, the maximal invasiveness of the virtual culture can be obtained with a chemically induced cell remodeling capability and not with a downregulation in the cell–cell adhesiveness, as one could expected.

Cell–cell adhesion has been provided to be an important factor in corneal epithelial wound healing [128]. In particular, the authors have speculated therein that coordinated cell–cell de-adhesion and re-adhesion cycles are required for an optimal recover of the lesion. In fact, too tight intercellular contacts inhibit a sufficient recolonization of the damaged area. The influence in single and collective cell migration of decrements in intercellular adhesiveness has been dissected in detail in the case of tumor invasion as well. For instance, a number of experimental studies have recently demonstrated that downregulation of cadherin molecules is implicated in a variety of metastatic cancers [22,23,25,127,136]. Further, glioma cell lines with low N-cadherin expressions have been observed to aggressively invade matrix gels (whereas the same populations with a high N-cadherin activity have been shown to grow slower and to expand less significantly in the host tissues) [63]. However, it is useful to notice that all these results are in contrast to the outcomes of the proposed model, which instead has predicted that a chemically induced cell–cell detachment does not significantly enhance cell invasion. The rationale of this discrepancy is probably that, in “real” cancer cells, the disruption of intercellular adhesive contacts concomitantly activates a series of intracellular programs (for example, the proteolytic regulatory machinery) that further increase the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of scattered malignant individuals. An aspect that is not included in the presented model.

Cell spreading and shape reorganization have been previously analyzed in several experimental wound healing models. For instance, both the above-mentioned wound closure mechanisms (i.e., lamellipodia crawling and purse string) significantly involve cytoskeletal dynamics. In [15,84], a circumferential ring of actin bundles has been shown to mediate the cell contractile response that draws the wounded edges of embryonic chick wing bud together. In [85], the authors have instead speculated on the fact that, in epithelial cell sheets of adult organisms, active protrusion of filopodia and PM ruffling can be observed in the cells located near the edge of the wound. Consistently, the first phase of a corneal epithelial wound healing consists of a sheet-like movement, during which cells at the leading front of the monolayer spread over a wide area by extending fan-shaped lamellipodia, as described in [128] and references therein. This is exactly what happens in the proposed CPM model. Further, increments in individual and collective cell migration upon initiation of intracellular pathways resulting in drastic cytoskeletal deformations (often integrated by activation of proteolytic machinery) is constitutively active in mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts and solid tumor cells [49,61,108,110,114], which display prominent protrusions and spindle-shaped morphology. In particular, the ability of tumor cells to undergo continuous morphological changes during motion has a big impact on their invasiveness (and eventually on the overall aggressiveness of the disease), as provided for pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1) in [106], with a microchannel-based approach, and in [10], with a Boyden chamber assay. In both cases, the authors have in fact correlated an increment in the ability of malignant cells to migrate within selected subcellular structures (microchannel-like chips and microporous membranes, respectively) to a drop in their elastic modulus, measured by micro-plate based single-cell stretchers. All these results are consistent with the outcomes of the proposed CPM simulations although without an explicit definition of the concept of persistent migration.

In the case of a two-component matrix, the proposed CPM simulations have shown that the healing potential of the cell population is significantly enhanced by a proper distribution of collagenous-like fibers. The density of the insoluble part of the matrix as well as the strength of cell–fiber adhesion determines instead a bimodal behavior of culture invasiveness. In this respect, it is useful to underline that model variations either of fiber amount or of 
                        
                           
                              J
                           
                           
                              C
                              ,
                              F
                           
                           
                              ext
                           
                        
                      are two distinct ways to modulate cell affinity with the fibrous component of the matrix, i.e., through variations either of the number of insoluble ligands or of the expression/activity of integrins, respectively. A biphasic dependence between the migratory capacity of cells and their adhesive affinity with matrix fibrous components has been found in a wide range of experimental works (not necessarily focused on wound healing systems). For instance, a number of 3D assays have shown similar trends for several cell types, including human prostrate carcinoma cells, whose velocity has been plotted as a biphasic function of selected adhesive parameters such as ligands functionality and receptor density [144], and melanoma cells, cultured in collagen scaffolds and stimulated with different concentrations of integrin-binding peptide RGD, which is a tripeptide composed of L-arginine, glycine, and L-aspartic acid, see [17]. Further, the velocity of primary human fibroblasts coated in synthetic matrix metalloproteinase-sensitive hydrogels has been provided to vary non-linearly with increasing ligand concentrations, as it first increases, reaches a maximum and then decreases [78]. In summary, all these experimental results are in a remarkable accordance with the outcomes of the proposed CPM, as they show that a medium level of both cell–fiber adhesion and fiber amount is needed for a maximal effectiveness of cell migration. Other studies have demonstrated that individual cell migration on planar substrates (which is fundamental in determining the healing rate of a cell culture) is limited for low fiber densities by the impossibility of cells to form sufficient attachments to generate traction and to move forward [59,75]. On the other hand, further experimental analysis have shown that, at too dense fibrous matrices, cell movement is inhibited because integrin receptors engage into stable focal adhesions, which hardly break thereby disrupting cell locomotion, as in the case of smooth muscle cells derived from aorta [40] and of fibroblasts [54] coated on collagenous substrates. Coherently, an optimal density of fibers has been provided to result in rapid and coordinated focal adhesion turnovers, which is necessary for a maximal cell movement of cells, see for instance [4,21,74,96] and reference therein.

The effect of cell–substrate adhesion on cell migratory determinants has been analyzed with models of wound healing as well. For instance, matrix substrates modified with increasing concentrations of adhesion ligands such as fibronectin (FN) and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides have been shown to facilitate wound closure in the case of endothelial cells [135], fibroblasts [135] and corneal epithelial cells (HCE, [5,44,98]). In particular, in [44], HCE sheets have been seeded on bioengineered substrates formed, from the bottom to the top, by a glass coverslip, an artificial extracellular matrix (aECM) containing RGD domains and a fibronectin layer. In this respect, the wound area has been obtained by peeling off a central PDMS barrier: this has permitted us to completely remove cells and fibronectin components and to have an exposed aECM in the region deprived of cells. As a result, the authors have observed a minimal invasion at low cell–aECM adhesiveness, given by a low concentration of RGD. On the opposite, a significant increment in wound closure rate has been measured in the case of maximal RGD density. Interestingly, the authors have noticed that increments in the healing capacity result by increments in the number of cells that “decide” to enter the exposed aECM area and not by increments in cell speed. In this respect, Fig. 16
                      shows a comparison between selected results from CPM simulations and the outcomes obtained in the paper by Fong and co-workers. In particular, the plot represents the wound edge displacement (at comparable times) in the case of the simulation setting of Fig. 10, a simulation employing the same matrix substrate as the one used in Fig. 10 but without a chemical stimulation of the virtual culture, and the experiments by Fong and colleagues performed with different densities of RGD domains. A good fitting both in the wound closure rate and in the final edge displacement is achieved between the case of the non-stimulated virtual cell culture and the experiments employing an aECM with a density of RGD greater than 50%. Although there are some relevant differences between in vitro and in silico settings (for instance, the latter neglect cell proliferation), such a comparison represents a further validation of the model outcomes in the case of a two-component substrate.

The close dependance between cell–fiber adhesiveness and cell migration is not necessarily valid for all cell types. Some cell lineage are in fact able to activate adhesion-independent strategies that allow them to move on or within a collagenous-like networks by unspecific interactions with the lattice or only by cytoskeleton-mediated propulsive mechanisms, see [47] for a review and [50] for a specific study on leukocytes.

The relationship between the efficiency of cell migration and the orientation and spacing of matrix components (and consequently of the adhesive ligands) has been experimentally proven by several experimental models. In [90], a set of wound healing experiments of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) sheets seeded on bioengineered silicon substrates has been analyzed with Cell Image Velocimetry (CIV, a software able to combine an automated detection mechanism for tracing the migrating wound front with a flow detection tool for capturing transport processes inside the cell layer). In a complete agreement with the proposed CPM simulations, an alignment in the topography of the surface in the direction orthogonal to the wound edge has been observed to induce cell shape polarization and orientation and to lead to sustained cell migration, thereby allowing an optimal wound closure. In [90], topographical modifications of the substrates have been obtained with nanoimprint lithography (NIL): lithographic and microprinting techniques have also been widely employed to create one-dimensional ECM pathways able to offer geometric guidance and adhesive structures at a microscale for increasing cell migratory ability [16,35,38,76]. Cell preferential migration along aligned matrix fibers within 3D environments has been analyzed as well for fibroblasts in collagen [33] or neuronal cells in fibrin substrates [37]. Lastly, in vivo intravital imaging studies of carcinoma cells in the mammary fat pad have pointed out the preferential chemotactic movement of invasive malignant cells along thick bundles of collagen fibers which behave as guidance cues towards blood vessels [26]. Finally, in the lymph node paracortex, the aligned microarchitecture of collagen and fibronectin fibers ensheathed by fibroblastic reticular cells significantly influences the migratory behavior of T-cells [9].


                     Comparison with the pertinent computational literature: Wound healing-like scenarios (both in vitro and in vivo) have been reproduced by several mathematical models as well. In particular, it is possible to distinguish three types of approaches: fully continuous, fully discrete (widely known also as Individual Cell-Based Models (IBMs) or Cellular Automata (CA)), and hybrid. The first group includes methods that describe the cell population of interest as a density, with its motility prescribed by a diffusive flux. The resulting behavior of the aggregate satisfies therefore a Fisher equation, characterized by traveling-wave solutions that advance with a speed determined by the diffusion coefficient. In this respect, the diffusivity can be considered either constant or a function of an external chemical factor [28]. Some models of this type also account for cell mitosis and apoptosis: as a consequence, speed and invasive depth of the moving front are further biased by variations in the overall cell mass and therefore depend on the cell duplication/death characteristic times, as in [80,81,111,129]. Finally, continuous approaches can be properly extended by incorporating mechanical aspects of cell traction, as done for instance in [131], where the authors have focused on wound contraction and have compared their predictions with selected results obtained from experiments on rats [87]. This continuous model has been further extended in [93] by including a phenotypic differentiation between fibroblasts and their active contraction-producing form, i.e., the myofibroblasts. With respect to the proposed CPM, the above-described continuous approaches are more suitable to deal with populations composed of a large number of cells, due to their low computational cost. However, they are not able to capture the behavior of individual cells: this impedes, for example, a proper reproduction of cell morphological evolutions as well as of wound invasion by fronts of scattered individuals. Also the phenotypical differentiation between cells located at different distances from the wound edge cannot be properly reproduced.

On the opposite, individual-cell based approaches (such as the CPM itself) represent each cell of the system of interest as one or a group of spatially defined units. In [71], a stochastic IBM has described the qualitative behavior of fronts of cells invading a wound. In particular, in that work, cells have been given probabilistic rules for motion and proliferation, which depend on an adhesive parameter. In this respect, the authors have found that different invasive morphologies arise from different ranges both of such a cell–cell adhesive strength and of cell proliferation rate. Interestingly, the same authors have also speculated that their adhesive coefficient can be related to the ratio between the magnetic coupling parameter and the Boltzmann-like temperature characterizing Ising models. These parameters correspond to

                      in the present paper (recalling that the CPM is originally based on the Ising approach). In [44], a dynamic Monte Carlo environment has been instead employed to study the role of crossing boundary in an epithelial wound healing, according to the above-mentioned corresponding experimental observations. In particular, the authors have implemented a master equation with probabilistic rules for cell spreading, retraction and proliferation, where the rate of movement towards the regions with exposed aECM is a function of the RGD density.

Finally, hybrid approaches use an individual-based representation for cells and a continuous approximation for both matrix substrates (with the assumption that collagen-like fibers are at least one order of magnitude smaller that cells) and molecular variables. In this respect, the family of models by Dallon and co-workers has deeply analyzed the relation between the migratory ability of cell aggregates (mainly fibroblasts or dermal cells) and topology and selected structural properties of the extracellular environment. For instance, in [29] cells have been modeled as point particles that move at a constant speed. However, the direction of their movement is governed by the local concentration and disposition of ECM fibers. The assumption made by these authors is consistent with the outcomes of the proposed CPM on the role of fiber alignment in determining the linearity of cell movement (and eventually the overall healing rate of the culture). In this respect, it is useful to remark that in this paper the relation between fiber distribution and cell movement is not prescribed a priori but is a self-emergent feature of the model. However, Dallon et al. have accounted both collagen deposition and fiber reorientation. In [30], the same group of authors have concluded that the most important factor influencing a scar after a lesion is the influx (also in terms of speed) of fibroblasts from the surrounding undamaged tissue. Then, in [31], they have further developed their approach to examine the role of TGF-β in affecting cell motility, proliferation and collagen production, and therefore ultimately in determining the healing rate. Finally, their more recent paper [86] has included a chemoattractant with a stationary, spatially nonuniform distribution, which is assumed to be produced by leucocytes that have migrated into the wound before fibroblast infiltration. In this respect, the authors have argued that the degree of scarring is maximized at a large chemoattractant diffusion coefficient and minimized in the presence of a chemoattractant inhibitor. The series of models by Dallon and co-workers has been developed in [27] by including a cytokine-dependent proliferation, the inhibition of mitosis when space is not available, a tensor-based representation for fibers (which allows us to account for the bidirectionality of fiber alignment, neglected in previous similar approaches) and cell–cell interactions, such as collisions and contact inhibition. In particular, these last model features are permitted by representing cells as discrete entities that can occupy not only a node but also an extended region of the domain (as happens, for instance, in CPM approaches).

Contact inhibition of movement in wound healing has been the main focus of an interesting model by Cai and co-workers [18]. The authors have first generalized the Fisher equation by defining the diffusivity as a decreasing function of the cell density. The resulting continuous model has been then decomposed to obtained a continuous-in-time discrete-in-space master equation for individual cell behavior. Finally, both copies of the model have been applied to an experimental wound healing system of mice NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. In this respect, it is interesting to observe that the phenotypic differentiation between external and internal cells (widely described in this CPM) has been captured both by their discrete-in-space approach and by their extended Fisher model.


                     Possible model developments: The proposed model is highly flexible and could in principle be applied to any cell population stimulated by any motility agent only changing the parameters describing the cell basal properties and regulating the dynamics of the chemical factor involved. For instance, as evident biomedically relevant examples, the application of the proposed approach to an epithelial cell culture would allow us to test the physiological conditions in which the recovery of skin lesions is more efficient. On the contrary, its application in the case of malignant cell lines would allow us to test potential therapies able to interfere with the ability of tumors to invade and metastasize.

However, the present CPM can of course be improved in several aspects. First, in the present version of the model, certain cell–matrix interactions that greatly affect cell migration both in vivo and in vitro have not been included, e.g., the ability of individuals to alter their environment by (i) the dissolution of insoluble matrix components via the activity of proteases, (ii) the deposition of matrix molecules and (iii) the remodeling of matrix fibers, mainly caused by tractional forces exerted by the moving cells themselves. In all the presented simulations, the substrate has been in fact assumed static, as cells have been allowed to change the lattice by only occupying sites, which, once abandoned, returned to their initial state. Finally, the importance of either haptotaxis, which is the tendency of cells to move along gradients of cell adhesion sites [20], or durotaxis, which instead defines the tendency of cells to move towards stiffer regions of a substrate [77], has not been elucidated. The preference for collagen-like components has been in fact described by a single parameter, i.e., 
                        
                           
                              J
                           
                           
                              M
                              ,
                              F
                           
                           
                              ext
                           
                        
                     , which defines the adhesion driven by cell–collagen receptors. This model coefficient can be interpreted as an implicit measure of the haptotactic force. However, it is equally possible to speculate that 
                        
                           
                              J
                           
                           
                              M
                              ,
                              F
                           
                           
                              ext
                           
                        
                      is determined by the cell preference for moving on a stiff substrate, i.e., by durotaxis. However, the proposed simulations have shown that a cell affinity for the fibrous structure of the matrix (whether haptotactic or durotactic in nature) is sufficient to enhance the invasive capability of the population. A deeper analysis of the mechanical properties of the substrate is however of particular relevance for explaining multiple other aspects of the healing process as well, as provided in [133] in the case of glioma cells.

A further development of the proposed model is its extension to three-dimensional settings that mimic more appropriately cell migration in in vivo conditions. The basic program of collective cell invasion within 3D environments requires not only cell polarization, attachment and propulsion by contraction of cytoskeletal elements, but also cell steering throughout steric obstacles, which typically characterize dense and rigid connective tissues. Cells are able to significantly move within constrained matrix environments by
                        
                           •
                           drastic morphological deformations that involve the substantial reorganization both of cell cytoskeleton and of other intracellular organelles, in particular of the nucleus, the most voluminous and rigid intracellular compartment, as described in detail in [46,48,55,59,108,139,140];

activation of localized pericellular proteolysis, able to degrade insoluble matrix components thereby opening space for cell movement (the reader may refer to [62,102] and again to [108,139,140] and references therein).

Realistic simulations of regenerations of damaged tissues would also require to account for functional differentiations occurring among individuals of the same population. For instance, leader and follower cells emerge during recovery of skin lesions [45]. Obviously, in these cases, it would be necessary to define in the model all cell types, with rules both for their specific behavior and for phenotypic transitions.

Finally, a complete and detailed description of in vivo wound healing scenarios should include other component mechanisms, such as selected inflammatory responses [39] and revascularization processes [130].


                     Wound healing assay: The experimental setup is analogous to the one described in the work by Ortolan et al. [94]. In particular, NIH:OVCAR-3 cells are grown to confluence. Then a

                      wound is created by scraping the middle of the cell monolayer with a sterile pipette tip. Finally, debris and floating cells are gently rinsed and removed, and RPMI-1640 medium with 1% FCS is added. Wound healing is observed at 0 and 12h in the case of NIH:OVCAR-3 cell transfection with a pcDNA3.1 vector containing either full-length CD157 cDNA (CD157 condition) or not (MOCK condition). Images are acquired using an Olympus Biosystems Microscope IX70, equipped with an F-View II camera and AnalySIS FIVE software (Olympus Biosystems).

                        μ
                        m

                        s
                     ). Both in the experimental and in the simulation setting, the linearity L of migration is obtained by the ratio between the x-component of the final displacement of a cell (x is the axis perpendicular to the wound edge) and its overall displacement at the end of the observation period [82]. The value of L ranges from 0 to 1, being close to 0 when the motion of the cell has no directional trend, and getting larger for motions clustered towards the center of the wound.

Wound healing capacity of the experimental culture is quantified by calculating the mean of 30 randomly chosen intercellular distances across the wound at time 12h divided by the initial width of the scratch (

                        exp

The migratory properties of the three cell subpopulations are instead statistically analyzed from a single realization for each simulation setting. In particular, in the circular charts, the final position (given in polar coordinates [7]) of 20 representative cells for each subgroup are represented. The instantaneous velocity, the mean velocity and the linearity (also for the experimental assay) are instead averaged (with SD) over 30 randomly chosen cells.


                     Model parameter estimates: The proposed model deals with a generic cell population stimulated by a generic chemical factor. Therefore, the set of parameter estimates is assembled from a composite set of data. However, the behavior of the computational results is fairly robust in a large region of the parameter space around such estimates. A summary of parameter values used in the model is given in Table 1, while in this section some details of how they are estimated is provided. The initial/target dimensions of cells represent the standard mean measures of an eukaryotic cell [2]. The cell basal properties have not a direct correspondence with specific experimental quantities. However, it is possible to heuristically infer their estimates with realistic biological observations. T

                     =1 can be found (lower values result in the complete inhibition of cell movement, as the nucleus is almost “frozen”). Since the model does not account for any nutrients, in order to keep fluctuations of cell volume within a few percent, a high κ=20 is set. ν measures both the compressibility of cell nucleus and the intrinsic cell elasticity. Assuming that without chemical stimulations cells do not significantly remodel a high ν=20 is also set.

As it is widely demonstrated in the literature (see for instance [125] and references therein), cells of a wide range of lines in standard conditions preferentially adhere to each other (via cadherin–cadherin junction) or with the fibrous component of the extracellular environment (via integrin ligand), while they experience substantially low adhesive interactions with the undifferentiated, gelatinous component of coating matrices. Therefore, after trying a wide range of values, a reasonable option is the hierarchy

The conversion between simulation time and experimental time is found by an empirical calibration between computational outcomes and corresponding experimental results, as done in [44]. In more detail, the wound closure percentages obtained from CPM simulations for different final observation times (i.e., for different numbers of run MCS) are fitted with the values of D
                     
                        exp
                      evaluated from the experiments by Ortolan et al. in the corresponding conditions (i.e., non-stimulated virtual cell culture vs. MOCK experimental cell culture and chemically stimulated virtual cell culture vs. CD157-transfected experimental cell culture). By using this approach, 21600 MCS are observed to correspond to 12h, as indicated by the gray shadow in the plot of Fig. 17
                     , and therefore 1 MCS corresponds to nearly 2s.

Such a temporal conversion, along with the characteristic size of each lattice site (i.e.,
