                  The paper presents the results of statistical analyses of ICT innovations on the examples of global and local standardisation. PDCA and methodology of statistical research were applied. Relying on the original research, ICT innovations were analysed in the period between 2000 and 2012, along with all areas of human endeavour. Regression equations were presented by explicit mathematical relations and their applicability in time was analysed.
                  Furthermore, this paper presents unique indices obtained by multicriteria analyses, for a closer determination of ICT innovations and the creation of models of knowledge excellence. The objectives of further development are also given.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The paper deals with the results of comparative analysis of ICT innovations and knowledge based on continuous innovation in ICT subfields on international (ISO, [1]) and local (SRPS, where SRPS is an abbreviation for the standards in Serbia [2]) examples: from the collective to the local and ultimately to the individual. According to International Classification Standards (ICS), the fields of ICT are classified through IT (partially, ICS1=35, with 12 subfields) and the field of telecommunications (ICS1=33, with 13 subfields).

The paper presents only a part of the overall dynamic comparative statistical analyses of knowledge innovation from the population of all standardised fields of human endeavour. The collective innovations (global, according to ISO, [1]), as well as local “innovations” of SRPS standards (according to [2]) were analysed by way of ICT applications [3], used as examples of ICT innovations. The paper analyses parts of ICT innovations of global and local standardised knowledge in two ICT fields: IT (ICS=35) with 5853 standardised units, sampled according to ISO and 925 units of knowledge standardised according to SRPS, and the field of telecommunications (ICS=33) with 194 ISO and 1191 SRPS samples.

PDCA [4,5] and the methodology of original statistical surveys of ICT innovations were applied for the period between 2000 and 2012, on the population of 42,091 ISO and 33,701 SRPS standards (in the beginning of 2012). Index criteria of ICT innovation were determined as well as ICT range within all other standardised areas. The results of the analysis of multi-year trends and market and financial evaluation point to the amount of innovated elements in PDCA concept at the end of each year of XXI century: 1) from the state of trends and Planning (P) of innovations, with the search of relevant databases — Do (D), from the innovation of a standardised database of knowledge and Check (C), to the improvements of the process and towards the excellence of Action and Advancement (A), with the ultimate goal of improving the products.

In the researched areas of ICT (ICS=33 and 35), a “problem” of local relevance was encountered. The problem is becoming even more highlighted in XXI century. In the period between 2008 and 2011 approximately 92% of SRPS “innovations” were processed which are evident from significant quantitative and time criteria (or indices). The situation is similar in terms of other criteria of “innovation” analysis: price index and value index. On the other hand, in the period of approximately 250 working days (2011), over 630 SRPS innovations appeared on the local level. At the same time, 180 SRPS standards (drafts) are under development.

Particularly significant are the possibilities of solving the “problems” of how individuals could approach innovation units of knowledge bases, especially in environments, institutions and corporations in developing countries.

The focus is on the frequent need for quantitative and qualitative knowledge innovation. Original unique annual analyses that were carried out continuously over a long period (2000–2012) are presented by comparing the trends in IT segments, in order to analyse mathematical relations and “rules”.

Some of the analysis criteria of ICT innovations include development activities of technical committees and relevant subcommittees of ISO/IEC JTC 1 [6]. In terms of high-quality education, significant comparative analyses of innovations and directions of further development of new knowledge units in ICT are presented through 808 “collective” ISO/IEC new projects and 209 “local” innovations.

The main goal is to achieve high-quality education with innovative results at all levels of hierarchy in practise: Top-down (from the international ISO, over local SRPS requirements, to the innovative products: software, hardware and services, in ICT and other areas of human endeavour with the aid of ICT) and vice versa, Bottom-up.

Internal goals were achieved by realisation of ICT applications of statistical research and by obtained results. The initial hypotheses of external research goals of ICT innovations are given in the presentation of the obtained results through the possibilities of:
                           H1)
                           application of newly-developed and innovated software on JAVA platform, for simplified quantitative and qualitative analyses and mutual comparison of the fields and sub-fields of ICT, as well as all the other fields of internationally standardised work, creativity and innovation (ICS=1, 3, 5 … 99), towards the comparable characteristics (through multicriteria analyses and the corresponding indices) for the two highest levels of “the game” in ICT innovations: global and local,

establishing clear correlation: global–local (collective) ICT innovations (on the examples of ISO–SRPS), with the annual trend of innovating knowledge units,

defining the indices and relation between continuous (annual) and discontinuous (cumulative, multi-year) innovation of individual knowledge,

setting regression equations by explicit mathematical relations, as well as their applicability in the temporal and space dimension of the afore-mentioned issues (global–local), at the platform of standardisation,

showing the highest level of ICT innovation, on the examples of standardisation in all fields of human endeavour, by comparative indices,

predicting future resource needs, planning financial needs for the evaluation of knowledge units and requirements in each individual subfield or all of them taken as a whole, in the subcommittees, development stages of new projects and products aiming for the model of knowledge excellence.

Some of the external goals of this paper are the selection of the analysis results which provide answers and solutions to important issues such as:
                           
                              1.
                              Can one define and determine the index parameters for comparing ICT innovations through statistical research of standardised knowledge units?

What are the specific challenges and correlations that innovators encounter in developing economies, both directly in ICT and in other fields where ICT is applied, either in local conditions (for example, knowledge innovations according to SRPS) or in comparison with international collective skills, requirements and obligations of the standards (according to ISO, in over 160 ISO member states)?

How does innovation takes shape in PDCA and how is it different, if at all, from industrialised economies (and what is the level of difference, on the examples of ICT standardisation: SRPS in relation to ISO, local knowledge (or national, to individual) in relation to the collective international innovations)? Is it possible to determine the quantity indices (Iq) on the relation between (collective-local) resources (ISO–SRPS)?

What are the enabling quality factors (at all levels of ICT and in temporal continuity of Deming's PDCA methodology: starting from the (P) planning, over the development of new projects — (D) Do, followed by checking of the application — (C) Check, and finally to the new innovations — (A) Advancement) that need to be considered to help innovators? What follows is the analysis of the results regarding Time indices on the relations of global–local resources (ISO–SRPS).

Do institutional and limited resources provide opportunities for innovators or do they hinder innovators in the ICT sector? What follows is the analysis of the results regarding Price indices and value indices on the relations of global–local resources.

According to [7], “Quality is free” philosophy was present in the previous century. Nowadays, standards are extremely costly.

The original analyses of the conditions and trends in IT were carried out several times a year: [8] — standardisation of IT applications and trends to 31.12. 2000, [9] — comparative performance of ISO standardisation, based on all twelve segments of IT and over then 1800 ISO documents per year (2000–2001–2002), [10] — partial analysis refers to the nine-year period (2000–2008), being presented through the contrasting analysis of trends within particular IT segments. The paper presents the results at the beginning of each calendar year, 2000–2012. Most researches deal with the standards in developed countries, while a considerably smaller number deals with the standards in developing countries, which leads to the “standardisation gap” of ICT standards in these environments with different degrees of development [11].

The focus of this paper is Quality of society level (Fig. 1
                     ). Therefore, majority of the above-mentioned related papers deal with this level. There is a significant number of articles dealing with ICT innovation in correlation with: finance, standardisation, related benefits, lifecycle of standards, formal and informal standards, globalisation, or “localisation” on the examples of governments, impacts on socio-economic development of developing countries, etc. In this paper, the framework of “the game” is presented on five levels (Fig. 1), and [12] explicates the workings of ICT standards on two game levels: level one (global) is a competition level which sets ICT standards within a nation or region and level two (local) is a competition level which sets the global ICT standards with reference to local standards. The article [13] presents the results of the research study (standards' lifecycle) and survival rates of formal standards in telecommunication and information technology, i.e. in the fields that are the focus of this work. According to [14], ICT standards are becoming increasingly intertwined with functions that are paradigmatic responsibilities of governments in several areas: innovations and competition policy of a nation; the ability of governments to perform services efficiently and cost-effectively. The papers dealing with the changes of national systems of innovation, as [15], promote a friendly critique of the approach to the national systems of innovations and offer some suggestions for its future development.

The article [16] considers the relation between finance and contribution of ICT to macroeconomic performances, and this paper aims to contribute to the level of Quality of company, where, at the same time, ICTs are essentially important for social development and economic growth, as in the paper [17]. There are more papers dealing with knowledge innovation, towards business services, as [18], where the Quality of society level leads to the Quality of Products level (QoP), all through the Quality of company (or Quality Assurance — QA) and Quality of Business (process) levels (QoB), Fig. 1.

The paper [19] considers the relations that exist between standardisation, and the instructions regarding the innovations in ICT. In addition, this paper considers the aspect of “PDCA”.

As much as in previous years, in the last few years PDCA is used as a method of improving web-based intelligent reports of an E-learning system as an intelligent system [20], or the PDCA cycle is used as the tool in the methodology which is based on the Crosby's philosophy [21], or for the harmonisation of multiple standards and models such as ISO 27001 and ISO 20000, and ISO 9001 [22].

There are a number of authors in the field of statistics and dynamics analyses of innovations, such as [23], whose work develops an incomplete contract model of the licencing relations to analyse dynamic effects of licencing on Research & Development competition in the innovation market, but not with this concept of multicriteria analyses. The paper [24] gives a short and very rough overview of the ongoing work in the field of statistics relating to the development of ICT and its impacts on the economies and on the society as a whole, which is the ultimate goal of this paper. Many years ago, the authors of [25] noticed that in the period between 1903 and 1941, an average monthly production of cars in the USA had a shape of a logistic curve. However, these and similar results cannot be generalised as principles of economic development, because this would be mathematical formalism that has no justification in PDCA.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

PDCA methodology on five levels of “the game” was applied in the research. Two unique ICT applications, in the form of Java software solutions, were developed for gathering data from websites. Collected variables are values that depend on each other. The corresponding results were obtained by statistical methodologies and tools supported by ICT. Data layout provides a possibility to discern a line by which the dependence of variables is approximated: straight line, square curve, cubic parabola, hyperbola, exponential curve, geometric curve or logistic curve. Processing of the results is adjusted to other IT tools as well, for example, some software packages: MS Excel [26], with its own application on the Java platform [3].

Based on PDCA and defined values of quantity indices of development projects (Iqu), i.e. based on quantity indices of innovation (Iqi, phase Do), the index (or “degree”) of innovation in time dimension (Ity or It/year — per year) is determined.

The period for checking the innovations (Check) in certain fields or subfields is dependent on the time index of innovation Ity. This index Ity is used for defining the groups or classes/clusters of innovation. The values of periodic checks (Check) of the research for practice (1 — year, 2 — month, 3 — week or 4 — day) are assigned to this index.

On the other hand, before the planned periodic surveys (Check phase), it is necessary to check the results of Web applications (or Java applications — as a software product that has its own PDCA phases). These checks are performed in the classical way, by Web browsers on the specified web addresses [1] and [2].

Web browsers allow for collecting reliable and valid data. In former research practise (from 1999 to 2013), the concepts of Web sites [1] and [2] were innovated and Web (Java) applications had to follow all the changes. Tests are carried out on all three levels of ICS (ICS1 — the first level for 40 fields, ICS2 — the second level for subfields and ICS3 — the third level of ICS).

The statistical methodologies of dynamic analyses and deductive–inductive reasoning methods were used for predicting the future development and innovation of the pragmatic framework according to Fig. 1. Here, the dynamic analysis entails testing and evaluation of the program by processing data in real-time.

The framework of this paper and research analyses is based on five levels of “the game” in the quality hierarchy (Fig. 1). A more detailed explanation of Fig. 1, through the PDCA, can be found in the following paragraphs of these Sections (3.2.1 to 3.2.4).

Besides mentality and reason, the first level also encompasses the limitations and problems in innovations (on the examples of standardisation) between ISO and the region: Europe (e.g. SRPS in Serbia), Russia, India, China, Brazil and South Africa.

The interdependence of levels (this one and the following one, Fig. 1) is presented through comparative analyses of global and national systems of innovations on the examples of ISO–SRPS standardisation (Fig. 2
                              ).


                              Fig. 2 presents a global framework of the starting hypothesis H2, while the correlations based on index sample quantities (Iqs) have been extracted from the total population of ISO–SRPS.

Social, cultural, civilisational and political effects of ICT innovations on this level (SRPS) have impact on other local characteristics:
                                 
                                    □
                                    Infrastructural elements comprise: 1—Policy, 2—State institutions, 3—Universities, 4—Mass media, Fig. 1.

Infrastructural elements can give shape to the field of local innovations, standards and papers that theoretically and with ICT support the management and all activities of enterprises, governments and other organisational bodies.

Policy of ICT innovation — includes national innovation systems (examples of SRPS standards), and regional organisations (European Union) as well.

Management without resources hinders innovations, innovation distribution and radical innovations in poor infrastructural conditions.

Although each of the afore-mentioned levels (according to Fig. 1) can be further presented through its own “micro PDCA”, only some elements for the level of quality assurance of the company are highlighted here:
                                 
                                    □
                                    QA (Fig. 1, or Quality Assurance Approaches (QAA) level according to [27]): Innovation management, frameworks for recording ideas, idea utilisation and problem framing techniques.

The role of venture capital in supporting ICT innovations is included through the price index and value index.

In the implementation of planned activities it is necessary to focus on the key levels of the quality of business/process (QoB) and quality of products (QoP) on the way towards the specified goals in PDCA (Fig. 1).

This level focuses on the knowledge that results from standardised education processes were supported by ICT innovations. ICT innovations are particularly important for supporting the development processes in PDCA.

Quality and quantity of innovation processes include creativity, knowledge capture, transfer, sharing and other standardised characteristics.

In this paper, the process is one of 12 criteria of the original model of excellence (Section 5.4).

Web-Crawler applications were developed in JAVA for the purpose of this study (products). They are used for browsing www.iso.org site and gathering all the necessary data for the subject analysis. In plain words, they browse websites in depth, to the third-level of standards, for ICS1, ICS2 & ICS3, according to [1] and [2].

As a reliability proof of the results of Java (Web) applications (or IT applications) the appropriate test examples have been used. The most appropriate test example is the one used for testing multiple levels of ICS (a comprehensive test), which is simple and short (Ity=1). In the field of IT (ICS1=35), it is an example for ICS2=35,220, for the second-level testing, but it is important to check the results for all the elements of the third level ICS3=35.220.xy (where xy=01, 10, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30 and 99). The details go beyond the scope of this paper and are the subject for the following/future papers.

Cases of innovative ICT applications in business, government and civil society include e-health, e-government, whereas in transport and logistics they include e-education, training, development, knowledge, etc.

For the complete “game” of this level (browsing, analysis, systematisation and presentation of the results) two original JAVA applications were used for research purposes, as the examples of ICT innovations of software products [3]:
                                 
                                    ­
                                    the first JAVA application browses (analyses) ISO/IEC standardised unit base (Iqs/ISO/2011
                                       ≈42,000 collective-global innovations on the examples of standards, Fig. 2),

the second ICT application gathers (and analyses) data on the local SRPS standardisation (Iqs/SRPS/2011
                                       ≈34,000 local “innovation”, Fig. 2).

With the use of these ICT applications, Web browsing and all the original data are processable on-line, in every standardised field and sub-field of human endeavour. Relevant results and analyses in PDCA spiral can be continuously innovated and updated. The samples and results (of Java applications) are significant for a longer period of time if the analysed fields/subfields have a lower intensity of innovation. For example, IT is the field of high intensity of innovation (Section 4.1, Table 2), but in a subfields of IT — it is lower (ICS2=35.160, see Section 4.1, Table 3).

The paper utilises distance sampling or Web-recording — sampling for the proper estimation of trend lines.

This allows for many forms of trend analysis to be performed with the goal of providing resources for education, and the knowledge requisite for new innovations.

Comparative criteria for ICT innovations through standardisation are defined by two-digit number of statistical indices of: the quantity (quantity indices), price (price index), value (value index), etc.


                              Quantity indices — the measure reflects the average that is proportionate to the changes in the quantities of a specified set of products and services between two time periods. Usually a quantity index is the value assigned for Std, Amd and/or Cor in a specified base period, while the aim of index values for other periods is to indicate the average percentage change in quantities in relation to the base period (although it is often used as a substitute for volume index).

Quantity indices (Iq) defined and determined for both ISO and SRPS relate to: Samples (Iqs), Published (Iqp), Under development (Iqu=Std+Amd+Cor), Withdrawn (Iqw), Deleted (Iqd), Innovations (Iqi) — for the full previous calendar year, including (Std+Amd+Cor, or individually: Iqis+Iqia+Iqic), Tables 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8
                              .

The results of the research and analysis of statistical samples are intended to provide effects and characteristics analogous to the output results of products in a company (level of QA or QoC or project). In this paper, the results serve the purpose of the project III 44006 (with 198 researchers from 31 research institutions, see Acknowledgements).

The results are presented aggregately and individually, by the corresponding multi-criteria indices:
                                 
                                    “Price index (plural: price indices or price indexes) is a normalised average (typically a weighted average) of prices for a given class of goods or services in a given region, during a given interval of time”, see Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia. It is a statistic designed to help to compare how these prices, taken as a whole, differ between time periods or geographical locations.

Price indices have several potential uses. For particularly broad indices, the index can be said to measure the economy's price level or a cost of living. More narrow price indices can help producers with business plans. Sometimes, they can be useful in helping to guide investment.

Certain aggregate value indices (ΣIv) were also defined for the collective global–local innovations (ISO–SRPS), including:
                                          
                                             -
                                             The values of innovations for all previous years for Iqu=Std+Amd (Cors are free of charge), see Table 1, columns (12) and (13);

Ivp, the value of all publications from previous years, only for Std+Amd (see Table 3, column (7));

Ivu, the value of all current projects under development (new projects) in the current year (Std+Amd without Cor);

Ivis+Ivia, the values of innovations from the previous year, Std+Amd, separately (Table 3).


                                       Value index is mostly a kind of counting or an average of such countings of several sample units.

This index often involves a probability index, over variables related to: 1) researcher/observer, 2) environment and 3) type of research.

In addition, these variables must be fixed and not time-varying. Without these assumptions, index values cannot be reliably interpreted.

The value index represents aggregate data which, in this case, contains information (including indices of quantity and individual prices) for the interpretability, further interpretation and analyses. The only problem with the value index is time-varying exchange rate (correlations: CHF, RSD, and CHF is the currency in Switzerland, CHF=100 RSD, and RSD is the currency in Serbia — for SRPS).

At the local level (SRPS), universities and education aim towards the excellence model. As Reference Framework for the Description of Quality Approaches (RFDQ), at this level Quality Management Approaches (QMA) — is defined by standards, such as ISO/IEC 19796–1 [27]. Reference Quality Criteria (RQC in [27]) in this study are presented in an original manner (with 12 criteria, Section 5.4).

All alternative solutions and proposals arising from the analysis of results and concluding remarks are subordinated to this key level of current and future endeavour. The interactions and correlations with other levels are significant as well. This paper analyses, compares and presents (collective) global–local knowledge in the standardised ICT areas for ICS1=33 and 35, Fig. 2, Table 1.

This level of “the game” is important for innovators (as competitors) in PDCA in terms of individual accessibility expressed by a value index of all the innovations from the previous year — Iva, and innovation quantity indices — Iqi. The value of ICT innovations on the examples of ISO standards (ICS=35) is the highest and extremely inaccessible to individual researchers (as competitors in any economy, Ivis/35/ISO/2011
                              =37406 CHF for Iqis/35/ISO/2011
                              =257), see Fig. 3
                              .

In addition to the field of IT, Fig. 3 shows significant innovation in the field of ICS1=25 (subfields Industrial automation systems, IT applications in industry — ICS2=25.040) with the relevant value indicators of 66 innovations or standard innovations (Iqis/25.040/ISO/2011
                              =66 and Ivis/25.040ISO//2011
                              =19488 CHF, during 2011). In the same field, in 2010, an even more serious and seemingly intractable problem was encountered in terms of individuals, as shown by indicators of value and quantity of innovations on the examples of standards (Ivis/25.040/ISO/2010
                              =84,320 CHF for Iqis/25.040/ISO/2010
                              =254).

The introduction and analysis of the quality indices of annual innovation, by the criteria Iqi/year, require annual monitoring of changes in the form of: Standards (Std or Iqis), Amendments (Amd or Iqia) and Corrections (Cor or Iqic). These criteria refer only to the ISO analyses (they do not exist in local forms of SRPS). The same criteria directly correlate with other quantity indices (Iq). Their correlations with the value indices (Iv) are of paramount importance to Std (or Ivis/year), minor importance for Amd, and they are least significant for Cor (because Ivic=0 in most cases). The examples in subfields of IT with the highest intensity innovation are presented in further analysis (see Section 4.1, Tables 3, 4, Fig. 5
                              
                              ).

@&#RESULTS@&#

The results of ICT innovation analysis (on the examples of standardisation of ISO along with SRPS standards) in the fields of telecommunications and IT, show clear trends by the charts presented for each field and subfield (ICS=33 and 35). The research results are shown in two segments of the chart:
                        
                           a)
                           the first part includes overall analyses of the current Standards (Std), Corrections (Cor), Amendments (Amd) and new projects under development (labelled as “Devel”), for all previous years,

the second part provides an overview of financial trend lines, including standards (Std) according to data obtained from the last few years of XXI century, which are sufficient for the formation of regression lines, including time indices, as a measure of innovations in the context of time and space.

In order to present graphical results (in part a) more clearly, solely specific numerical values are laid out, since Corrections (Cor) are free of charge and the prices of Amendments (Amd) are considerably lower than the prices of Standards — Std, the number of Cor and Amd is minimised.

The results of the analysis of standardisation and IT evolution are shown in Fig. 4.

                              With overall analyses for the period from 1973 to 2012 (Std+Amd+Devel): Iqp — published documents are singled out (Fig. 4a, Table 3), while the price of ∑Iv/ISO
                                 =346,986 CHF includes Iqu — under development (ISO/Std=663 and ISO/Amd=82).

This trend line excludes standards from the previous years which were withdrawn from use (which are numerous), and it does not include any corrections — Cor, so it represents a minimum quantitative (but not qualitative) trend of innovation — (H4) setting regression equations by explicit mathematical relations, as well as their applicability in the temporal and space dimension: global (ISO) – local (SRPS).

The trend of IT innovations/publications (Iqp, from 2000 to 2011) is shown in Table 2
                        .


                        Table 3
                        , ICS2=35.020 and ICS2=35.240: These are examples of the subfield of the fourth class (Ity=4), which requires continuous daily monitoring of innovations. Ity=0, for Iqu=0 during the previous three-year period, for example, for ICS2=35.160. Ity=1, for 1≤Iqu≤10 (planned annual audits/checks), for example, ICS2=35.020=35.220 and ICS2. Ity=2, for 10<Iqu≤50 (monthly check). Ity=3, for 50<Iqu≤250 (weekly check) — the largest number of subfields in IT (Table 3, column 8). Ity=4, for Iqu>250 (daily checks), for example, for ICS2=35.040 and ICS2=35.240.

Verification tests of the results (of Java applications) for the subfields with higher intensity of innovation (ICS2=35.040 or 35.240, Fig. 5), were performed at weekends (on Saturday and Sunday), when the Web data sources are not updated on the web addresses [1] and [2]. For example, in the subfield of IT (ICS2=35.160), Ity=0 (Iqu/2012=Iqi/2010=Iqi/2011=0, sample of Iqs/35.160/1999
                        =22 units from 01.01.2000 was innovated and in the period of 13years it reached the quantity of Iqs/35.160/2012
                        =31, by checking the results on 01.01.2013, which were the same as on 01.01.2012, Table 3).

The trend of ICT innovations in the subfields of IT is shown in Fig. 5. Left a) Iqi/ISO/2000–2011
                        ≈Std+Amd (bez Cor), and right b) Iqi/ISO/2000–2011

The example (Iqi/ISO/2000–2011, 35.040 together with 35.xyz), qualitatively, (from 2004 and currently) in comparison with all the other IT fields, on the examples of ICS2=35.xyz=35.040, 35.060, 35.080, 35.100 and 35.240, IT field at the top has the highest number of new standardised ISO innovations (see Table 2, Fig. 5).

The example (Iqi/35.040/ISO), for ICS2=35.040, quantitatively, at the beginning of the analysis — on 31/12/2000, there were Iqp/35.040/ISO/2000
                           =183 standards (Iqi/35.040/ISO/2000
                           =32 innovations in 2000), and finally, on 31/12/2011, there was the largest number of standards from all IT fields — Iqp/35.040/ISO/2011
                           =818, and the largest number of innovations — Iqi/35.040/ISO/2011
                           =118 in 2011, see Fig. 5 — right (b) and Table 3.

The example (Iqu, Iqis, Iqia, Iqic — by the subcommittees JTC 1 SC): Who deals with IT innovations, development, corrections, changes?

What follows is the display of ICT innovation and standardisation of quality products for 35.040 (according to subcommittee ISO/IEC JTC 1, [6]): Coded Character Sets (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2), Security mechanisms and security (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27), Coding of multimedia, audio, image (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29), Automatic identification techniques (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 31), Organisation of data (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32), and Biometric techniques and technologies (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 37), (Table 4
                           ).

On the example of this IT sub-field (ICS=35.040), JTC 1 (1), JTC 1/SC 4 (3) and TC 36 (4) were included in the development of Iqu/35.040/ISO/2011
                           =275 projects (238 Std+22 Amd+15 Cor), in October, 2011, and Iqs/35.040/ISO/2012
                           =1597, Iqu/35.040/ISO/2012
                           =266 projects (207 Std+45 Amd+14 Cor), included JTC 1 (7), JTC 1/SC 4 (2), TC 36 (1), JTC 1/SC 38 (1) and TC 46/SC 4 (2) in October, 2012.

In the field of telecommunications (ICS=33, in its entirety), statistical sample includes Iqs/33/ISO/2011
                        =192 documents, of which Iqp/33/ISO/2011 are published (from 1994 to 2011), Iqu/33/ISO/2012 are at various stages of development and Iqw=70 are withdrawn from use. Out of (Iqp+Iqu)/33/ISO
                        =124 standards and recently projected ISO documents (with the value of ∑Iv=13944 CHF), nine standards — Std are under development (without amendments — Amd and corrections — Cor).

Currently, a number of sub-fields (for ICS1=33) do not have significant development or innovations on a global level, having therefore no impact on products (Iqp/33/ISO/2011
                        =1, Ivis/33/ISO/2011
                        =122 CHF).

On the other hand, this field is rapidly developing and innovating on the local level, (see Table 5
                        ). For example, in the subfields with global Iqp/ISO
                        =0, local indices Iqp/SRPS are relatively high, as in: radio communications (Iqp/33.060
                        =64), Mobile services (Iqp/33.070
                        =6), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN, Iqp/33.080
                        =3), special measuring equipment for use in telecommunications (Iqp/33.140
                        =1), audio, video and audiovisual engineering (Iqp/33.160
                        =220), television and radio broadcasting (Iqp/33.170
                        =15), fibre optic communications (Iqp/33.180
                        =311), telecontrol, and telemetering, including Supervising, Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA, Iqp/33.200
                        =63).

Therefore, the creation of a standardised base of knowledge towards the innovation of products in the afore-mentioned subfields requires a “local level of the game”, innovation, and knowledge (on the examples of SRPS).

In contrast to the papers [28] and [29], which present a comparative analysis of two advanced ICT nations, this paper provides the analyses of the relations of the standards of a nation (SRPS) in parallel with the global ISO. As shown in [30] there is a positive correlation between ICT competitiveness and economic growth, as well as international competitiveness. Compared to other papers, which deal with the existence of a standard framework for the creation of ICT standards “a framework for ICT standards creation”, [31], this paper deals with the possibilities of accessing ICT standards aiming towards their application for updating the knowledge in PDCA.

This research and accompanying analyses of the results were conducted at no cost. Therefore, a significant amount of money and time was saved, which would otherwise be spent on field research or on non-automatic data processing.

The planned objectives have been achieved, and the analysis can be extended to all standardised fields of work. All initial hypotheses (H1 to H6) have been proven:
                           H1)
                           The software on JAVA platform has been reinnovated (in late 2012), for simplified quantitative and qualitative analyses and mutual comparison of the fields and sub-fields of creativity and innovation (ICS1=1, 3, 5 … to 99). In the meantime, the software has been innovated and a new annual overview of data has been given for the entire population of ISO–SRPS, on 01.01.2013. Thus, the previously defined (theoretical) relations (from P1 phase) are compared to the implementation of new research (from 1.1.2013, in re-planning phase — P2).

Clear correlation between global and local (collective) ICT innovations (on the examples of ISO–SRPS), with the annual trend of innovating knowledge units, has been established. Research framework is presented in Sections 3.2.1, 4.2, followed by Table 5, and these results will be supplemented in Section 5.2.

The indices and relation between continuous (annual quantities indices — Iqi/year and value index — Ivis/year) and discontinuous (cumulative, multi-year — Iqs, ∑Iv) innovation of individual knowledge have been defined (Section 4.1, Tables 3 and 4, and Section 5.2, Tables 5–7
                              
                              ).

Regression equations have been set by explicit mathematical relations (01.2012). Their applicability was analysed in temporal (a period of one year) and space (global–local) dimension at the platform of standardisation (Section 4.1, as well as in Table 5).


                              Table 5, column 4 show that plan-1 (or P1 phase) can be presented by value indices Ivis/35/2012/ISO+SRPS/P1
                              =36311 CHF+9739 CHF=46050 CHF.

Phase D1 (or Do-1, column 5, Table 5) shows that ISO and SRPS standards from 2012 require the amount of Ivis/35/2012/ISO+SRPS/D1
                              =33000 CHF+11900 CHF=44900 CHF. Therefore, there is a slight difference between index Ivis (under P1, or Plan-1) and the index implementation in practice (phase D1 or Do-1). The difference is 3%, which is within the allowed statistical error.

The correctness of linear trend line is discussed in phase C1. Fig. 8
                              
                               shows the maximum deviation of the linear trend lines. Therefore, the error is reduced by selecting other regression trend lines (exponential, power, logarithmic and polynomial).

New analysis (in A1 phase) is supplemented with data from 2012 and new regression equations are formed, Fig. 8. This is the beginning of a new part P2D2C2A2 of the quality spiral (Table 5, as presented in [20]). The relations are corrected (1.2) and (1.3) and new relations are made (Fig. 8) with new values (power — choice for Ivis/2013, column 8), as well as a plan of needs (or P2) for 2013.

Original mathematical relations have been obtained on the basis of new results, comparative standardisation analyses and valued knowledge. These relations can be used for anticipating expectations for ICT innovations. According to the obtained results, presented analyses and the graphical presentation of trends, the coefficients of the directions of dependence of new knowledge in ISO–SRPS documents have been defined and compared (from January, 2012 to January, 2013).

The highest level (or intensity) of IT innovation is presented and demonstrated on the examples of standardisation in all fields of human endeavour (Figs. 2, 3 and Table 8
                              , Section 5.3), by comparative indices (Iqs, Iqp, Iqu, Iqi to Ivis, Ivp, and Ity). In the field of IT, out of 12 subfields, three belong to the highest degree of innovativeness (ICS2=35.040, 35.100 and 35.240). This degree of innovativeness (Ity=3) involves continuous weekly updating of knowledge. According to the indices from Table 4 (Iqu, Iqi), this is especially true for the development trends of three subcommittees: SC 27, SC 29 and SC 37.

The predictions of future resource needs have been realised, as well as plans of financial needs for the evaluation of knowledge units and requirements in each individual subfield (ICS2=35.xyz) or all of them taken as a whole (ICS1=35), in the subcommittees and development stages of new projects and products — aiming for the model of knowledge excellence in practice (Section 5.4).

The results of the analyses presented in the paper are compared with the knowledge trends in other fields (and subfields). For example, knowledge standardisation in road vehicles engineering (ICS1=43), according to [32].

The results of analysis of local “innovations” of standardisation are rather unusual. In contrast to the continuous development within international framework, there was up to 92% innovations (Iqp on the examples of SRPS standards) at the local level, solely in previous four years (2008–2011, see Table 6).

On the other hand, indicators of aggregate values (Ivis, on the annual level of all individual prices of given Iqp quantities) are considerably lower than the international ones, on the examples of ISO (Table 6b — Ivis/35/SRPS
                        =2071, along with Ivis/35/ISO
                        =37406 — Table 3, and Ivis/33/SRPS
                        =2508, along with Ivis/33/ISO
                        =122).

According to the presented tendencies for the publication of ISO–SRPS documents and development projects, obtained mathematical relations and presented trend lines (in theory), or on the basis of individual findings from the analyses of phases of new project development (in practice), one can predict the future resources and financial needs for each of the subfields separately and for all of them together. For the afore-mentioned fields of ICT innovations, particularly telecommunications and IT, the correlation global (ISO) – local (SRPS) is obvious, see Table 7.

The indicators clearly show that, for the approximately same volume – the quantity of innovations (Iqi/35/2011) – the values are significantly different (almost five times higher) on the relations: global–local (Ivis/35/2011, Table 7).

As for the analyses of the telecommunications field (ICS1=33), the situation is quite different, see Table 7.

Financial, organisational and other approaches for the insight into this “unprotected” knowledge through the standards are indispensible.

Based on the original successive years of research, monitoring and analysing of ICT innovations on global (ISO) – local (SRPS) relations, one can get a clear picture of trends in innovations in all fields of ICT, IT subfields, etc. ICT innovations have been subjected to multicriteria analyses by way of numerous innovations that require continuous updating of knowledge.

As in the previous years of XXI century, in early 2012, the field of ICT (IT — on the global examples of ISO), recorded the highest values of statistical indices (Table 8):

of all fields, only (Ida) was at the second place according to the number of planned new projects in 2012 in the category of amendments (Amd – under development – Ida/35/ISO/2012.01

                                       =473).

Based on index values Ity for ICT, groups or classes/clusters of innovation (or Check phase) with values (0 — perennial, 1 — year, 2 — month, 3 — week or 4 — day, Section 4.1) have been determined. Applied methodology for clustering subfields of ICT has the advantage (in terms of application in practice), compared to the same theoretical methods of hierarchical clustering analysis in mathematical taxonomy (Ward minimum variance method, Centroid linkage method, and others).

As for the analyses of the telecommunications field, the situation is quite different, in comparison to IT:
                                 
                                    -
                                    This field with its subfields is developing and innovating at the local level more intensely (compared with the global), according to all previous multi-criteria indices,

examples, ICS1=33, 13 subfields, Fig. 7, with comparative indices: Iqp, Iqu, Ivp, ∑Iv,

at the local level (according to the indicators of multicriteria analysis of SRPS standards) the field of telecommunications is rapidly developing, innovating, and therefore, it is at the top of all fields of human endeavour (Fig. 2, with innovations in the last five years, Fig. 7a2), Iqs/33/SRPS
                                       =1191 samples for conducted analyses (from a population of Iqs/∑1−99/SRPS
                                       =33701 units SRPS),

At the global level, according to the Iqis/33/ISO/2011
                                       =1 criterion it is at the penultimate 39th position (of all standardised fields of human expertise, Fig. 7a1), according to Ivis/33/ISO
                                       =122, it is at 38th position and, according to Iqu=Ids/33/ISO/2011
                                       =9 it is at 35th position, etc.

As for the time aspect and on the pathway towards the fulfilment of objectives of knowledge management on the platform of standardisation, ICT innovations hold the most important place in PDCA, as shown in the model of [33], E-learning as innovation as in [34]. In practice, the analogies of computer micro systems (here IT) are often used to solve some of the macro processes, macro problems, at the level of QMA, for improving the quality of teaching and learning with ICT. This paper presents IT through 12 standardised subfields, and therefore, the A-phase of improvement includes the alternative solutions to the problem through the excellence model that contains analogous 12 criteria. The focus is laid on PDCA: P) resource planning, D) process implementation, C) checking of the analysis and results and A) improvement or innovation, or “storage” of knowledge. What follows is the presentation of detailed analyses of the model through 12 “micro” fields of IT or 12 key “macro” modelling criteria of product excellence with the support of ICT in PDCA:
                           
                              1-
                              the original analyses of ICT innovations, on the relations of global–local resources, of all 12 subfields of IT – globally and telecommunications subfields – locally, demonstrate the importance of further product innovations through leadership and innovated products in the presented PDCA spiral,

as for organisational, temporal, practical, planning and other relevant aspects of ICT innovation, the most creative is team approach to innovation, starting from the government and state management (especially at the local level in the field of telecommunications in PDCA), while time variability of prices (and thus, the index of price and value), has no influence on the ranking of ICT in comparison with other areas of creativity,

an original methodology and developed software (which is in itself an ICT innovation on JAVA platform), facilitates, accelerates and simplifies the analyses, enabling the presentation of many details. However, its presentation goes beyond the frames of a paper such as this one,

collective and individual indices, parameters and criteria of the analyses of ICT innovations tend from quantitative towards qualitative indicators of innovation trends — which are more important for a higher level of quality at every level presented in the hierarchy of quality, to the development of new products in all fields (for ICS1=1, … 99),

extraordinary benefits of global Internet technology, Web tools, and Java platform are evident, and the organisations that professionally deal with standardisation can and should be a role model to other enterprises in PDCA (detailed qualitative indicators require more space in the paper),

there is a need for the adjustment of the user of the standards to the international concept of ICT development and innovation of the “second level of the game”, as well as a need for the use of both levels by several partners in LAN/MAN/WAN…, as shown by the examples of IT innovations and development of local telecommunications,

ICT innovations in PDCA spiral of quality, in each successive time increment should contribute to the product quality in other areas of human endeavour,

knowledge innovation is the focus of all processes, related activities, resources and output results, leading to successful business performance and better results of each education (E-learning),

special attention should be paid on solving the problem of resources in PDCA (financial trend lines show how much money and how many resources are necessary on average: annually, monthly, weekly) for updating the knowledge and products,

all these criteria, interfaces and index parameters in the temporal dimension of the analysis, enable the formation of a special model or concept of ICT innovation in PDCA, see Fig. 9
                                 ,

the need for innovation of the academic knowledge of teachers, teaching associates and students is significant, with clearly focused objectives of ICT innovation in PDCA,

the results of the analyses on two levels are important for the other three levels in the hierarchy of quality, for gaining confidence of new users among professionals in ICT, and in other fields of creativity and innovations in PDCA.

The next step should be a detailed economic and social analysis towards new alternative solutions to the problems of a standardised approach to innovations in PDCA.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Based on the results and indicated analyses in the fields of ICT innovations (ICS1=33 and 35), it can be concluded that the continuous updating of knowledge of each individual expert in ICT directly depends on PDCA level.

The conclusions arising from the research (or from the details of analysis), can be grouped in the phases of the spiral of knowledge quality in PDCA:
                        
                           P) According to the presented trends of developing, publishing, using and withdrawing ISO–SRPS innovations, mathematical equations were obtained and trend lines were presented (in theory). As for the aspect of innovation, some other indicators were more important, such as the indices of planned innovations through new developing projects (Iqu, Iqds, Iqda, Iqdc, Ivis, Iv).

D) At the level of “game” in “Do-phase” (with the goal towards the process excellence), “availability” of the standards has been proven through annual innovations and related indices of quantity, prices and valued units of standardised innovations, and with the possibility of a simple “copying” on the monthly, weekly or daily work-related obligations and innovations of individuals.

C) For the presented field of ICT (with the subfields of ICS1=35 and ICS1=33) the relations between global and local innovations (such as ISO–SRPS) are obvious, where ICT innovations are mostly unavailable to individuals in PDCA.

A) Improving the situation in practice (in Phase A — Action and Advancement) requires this alternative solutions of a local (state or national) approach to the problem of standardised units of knowledge bases in the fields and subfields of expertise (ICS1=33, 35, and all the other fields for ICS1=1 to 99), for the innovations of all products.

Innovative (or continuous or developmental involvement in new projects) updating of individual knowledge has an obvious advantage over discontinuous (or aggregate) updating of individual knowledge. Based on individual knowledge in subcommittees and developmental stages of new projects (in practice), financial needs in each individual subfield or in all of them are of special importance among the analysed and presented possibilities for anticipating future resources (especially on the examples of SRPS innovations in PDCA).
