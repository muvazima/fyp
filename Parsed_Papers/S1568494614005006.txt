                  This paper studies some decision rules for ambulance scheduling. The scheduling decision rules embedded in the decision support systems for emergency ambulance scheduling consider the criteria on the average response time and the percentage of the ambulance requests that are responded within 15min, which is usually ignored in traditional scheduling policies. The challenge in designing the decision rules lies in the stochastic and dynamic nature of request arrivals, fulfillment processes, and complex traffic conditions as well as the time-dependent spatial patterns of some parameters complicate the decisions in the problem. To illustrate the proposed decision rulesâ€™ usage in practice, a simulator is developed for performing some numerical experiments to validate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed decision rules.
